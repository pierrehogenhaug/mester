_EEA product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market:_
Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market
assessment in respect of the securities described in this offering memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending such securities (for the purposes of this paragraph, a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

_UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target_
_market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target_
market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for
the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes
(for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
**Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes**
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

_Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The securities described in the attached offering_
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any EEA
retail investor. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No


-----

1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

_Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors. The securities described in the attached offering_
memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any UK
retail investor. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling any in scope securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK
has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful.

##### International Design Group S.p.A.
**€470,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026**
International Design Group S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of Italy (the
“Issuer”), is offering €470,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026 (the
“Notes”).
The Notes will mature on, 2026. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR
(with 0% floor) plus % per year, reset quarterly. Interest will be paid on the Notes quarterly in arrears on,
, and of each year, beginning on, 2021. Prior to, 2022, the Issuer will be
entitled, at its option, to redeem all or, from time to time, a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole”
premium. At any time on or after, 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.
Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to
repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In addition, the Issuer may
redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.
Pending consummation of the acquisition of YDesign Group, LLC (the “Target” or “YDesign”) by a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer (the “Acquisition”), as further described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering
**Memorandum”), the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue**
Date (as defined herein), deposit €150.0 million of gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes into an escrow account,
in the name of the Issuer. The escrow account will be controlled by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Escrow Agent”) and
pledged in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed
proceeds from the escrow account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the
Acquisition pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (as defined herein) within two Business Days following
the escrow release. If the conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds have not been satisfied on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date (as defined herein), the Issuer will be required to redeem Notes with an aggregate issue price equal
to €150.0 million at a redemption price equal to the issue price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the
Issue Date to but excluding such special mandatory redemption date and additional amounts, if any. The redeemed Notes
shall be selected pro rata for redemption from all of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption”._
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and, within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial Guarantors (as defined herein). Within 90 days following the Completion Date
(as defined herein), the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the U.S. Guarantors (as defined herein). The Notes
Guarantees (as defined herein) will be subject to certain agreed security principles and certain material limitations pursuant
to applicable laws as described under “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability”. As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Escrow Charge. In addition,_
subject to certain agreed security principles and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, the Notes will be
secured on a first-ranking basis, within five Business Days from the Issue Date, by the Initial Collateral (as defined herein),
within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, by the Post Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein) and, within 90 days from
the Completion Date, by the Post Completion Date Collateral. The Collateral (as defined herein) also secures or will secure,
as applicable, on a first-ranking basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined herein) and
certain hedging obligations (if any). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), the holders of
Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
and counterparties to certain super priority hedging obligations (if any) have been repaid in full.
Subject to and as set forth in “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”, the Issuer will not be liable to pay any
additional amounts to holders of the Notes in relation to any withholding or deduction required pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time), and any
implementing regulations (“Decree No. 239”) or Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as as the same
may be amended or supplemented from time to time), and any implementing regulations (“Decree No. 461”) if the Notes
are held by a person resident in a country that is not included in the list issued under Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239,
and otherwise in the circumstances as described in “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”.
There is currently no public market for the Notes. We have applied to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “LuxSE”) and traded on the LuxSE’s Euro MTF market (the “Euro MTF Market”). There is
no assurance that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market.
The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein) and the Initial Purchasers (as
defined herein) expect to deliver the Notes in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) on or about, 2021 (the “Issue Date”).
Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 38.

Price for the Notes: % plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.


**The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as**
**amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes will only be offered or sold within**
**the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A**
**under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance**
**on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be**
**relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Notice**
**_to Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer_**

## NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS

**_European Economic Area_**
In relation to each member state of the European Economic Area which is subject to the
Prospectus Regulation (each, a “Relevant Member State”), each Initial Purchaser has represented
and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Regulation is
implemented in that Relevant Member State, it has not made and will not make an offer of
Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the
public in that Relevant Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation), as permitted under the Prospectus Regulation, subject to obtaining
the prior consent of the Initial Purchaser nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation;

_provided that no such offer of the Notes shall require the publication by the Issuer or any Initial_
Purchaser of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a
prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making
or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in
which no obligation arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such
offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor does the Issuer or any
Initial Purchaser authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary,
other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the
Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer” “offer of notes to the public” or
“offer of securities to the public”, in each case in relation to any of the Notes in any Member
State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase
or subscribe for the Notes, and the expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Member State.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in this offering located within a Relevant Member
State will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified
investor” within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. The Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates, and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a
person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in
writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase
the Notes in this offering.

_EEA product governance / Professional Investors and eligible counterparties only target market_
Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers the target market
assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels
for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (for the
purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

v


-----

_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_
The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any EEA retail
investor. For these purposes, an “EEA retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified
investor” as defined in Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail**
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

**_The United Kingdom_**
This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) are outside the United
Kingdom or (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as
amended the “Financial Promotion Order”)); (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion
Order; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes
may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at
relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.
Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available
only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

_Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors_
The securities described in the attached offering memorandum are not intended to be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any UK retail investor. For these purposes, a “UK
**retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client, as**
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; (b) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any
rules or regulations made under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the
“FSMA”) to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling any in scope securities or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful.

_UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target_
_market_
Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the
Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business
Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes
(for the purposes of this paragraph, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook

vi


-----

Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
**Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes**
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**_Italy_**
The offering of the Notes has not been cleared by the Commissione Nazionale per la Società e la
_Borsa (“CONSOB”) (the Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian securities_

of any other document relating to the Notes be distributed in the Republic of Italy, except (a) to

“Issuer Regulation”), implementing Article 100 of the Italian Financial Act; and (b) in any other
circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 100 of
the Italian Financial Act and the implementing CONSOB regulations, including the Issuer
Regulation.

The Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or
distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or of any other document relating to the
Notes in the Republic of Italy will be carried out in accordance with all Italian securities, tax and
exchange control and other applicable laws and regulations.

Any such offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering

defined by Article 1, first paragraph, letter r), of the Italian Financial Act), to the extent duly
authorized to engage in the placement and/or underwriting and/or purchase of financial
instruments in the Republic of Italy in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Italian
Financial Act, the Regulation 20307, as amended, Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of

applicable laws and regulations and any other applicable requirement or limitation that may
be imposed from time to time by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy (including, the reporting
requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Italian Banking Act and the
implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time) or any other
relevant Italian competent authorities.

**_Denmark_**
This Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be filed with or approved by the Danish
Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) or any other regulatory authority in Denmark.
Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that the Notes may not be offered,
sold or delivered directly or indirectly in Denmark, except (a) to a preselected group of
institutional investors that constitute eligible counterparties within the meaning of Executive
Order No. 2092 of December 14, 2020 issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Business Act
identified by the Initial Purchaser, (b) in compliance with the Prospectus Regulation, the Danish
Capital Markets Act and Executive Orders issued thereunder, (c) in compliance with Executive
Order No. 2092 of December 14, 2020 issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Business Act, (d) in
a manner that is not deemed to constitute an offer to the public in Denmark and (e) in a manner
that is not deemed to constitute an approach to the public in Denmark for the purposes of the
Issuer receiving other repayable funds from the public within the meaning of the Danish
Financial Business Act.

**_Spain_**
The Notes may not be offered or sold or distributed in Spain, nor may any subsequent resale of
the Notes be carried out, or publicity or marketing of any kind be made, in Spain in relation to
the Notes except (a) in circumstances which do not require the publication of a prospectus in
accordance with the Prospectus Regulation or constitute a public offering (oferta pública) of
securities within the meaning of section 35 of the Restated Spanish Securities Market Act
approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015, of October 23, 2015 (Real Decreto Legislativo
_4/2015, de 23 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Mercado de_

addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking

indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and
other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

- effects and risks of Covid-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows and other potential epidemics or infectious outbreaks that may have
a similar impact;

- our ability to successfully introduce new products, develop our brands and adapt to changing
consumer preferences;

- significant competition in the development, production and sale of our products;

- our ability to identify and complete value-enhancing acquisitions and the risks that they may
not deliver the expected benefits;

- the potential for consumer spending on high-end design products to be replaced by spending
on other activities;

- our ability to fully realize the Group’s commercial and strategic vision;

- our ability to integrate YDesign effectively and realize the expected synergies from the
Acquisition;

individual currencies within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, as
well as the current political uncertainty in Italy;

and, in limited cases, to make certain expenditures;

- risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

- our ability to maintain our relationships with key suppliers of certain raw materials,
components or finished products;

- any increase in the prices of the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of
the components or finished products we purchase, to the extent we are not able to pass on
such price increases to our customers;

- our ability to accurately forecast demand for certain of our products and to adequately
manage our product inventory;

- any disruptions relating to our manufacturing or assembly facilities or warehouses or to our
distribution or delivery processes;

- our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees, and the risk of loss of key
personnel;

entities;

- other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not
exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the
impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,
“Industry and Market Data” and “Our Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that
could affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks,
uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Offering
Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, prospective investors should not
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on
which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our representatives,
acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking
statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are
not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other
communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be
correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking
statement or risk factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments
or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or
to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As a
result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

## PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

##### Historical Financial Information

**_The Issuer_**
The Issuer is a holding company, jointly controlled by the two Sponsors, that was incorporated on
September 10, 2018 for the purpose of the acquisition by the Issuer of each of Flos, B&B and
Danish Holdco, which was completed on November 22, 2018. In this Offering Memorandum, we
present, inter alia, the historical consolidated financial information for the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we”, “us”,
“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum
are to the Issuer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

The historical financial information of the Issuer included in this Offering Memorandum has been
extracted or derived from (i) the English translation of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, including the notes
thereto (the “2020 Consolidated Financial Statements”) and (ii) the English translation of the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019, including the notes thereto (the “2019 Consolidated Financial Statements”
and, together with the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial
**Statements”).**

The 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements also present comparative columns as of and for the
period ended December 31, 2018, reflecting approximately one month of activity of the Group
following the abovementioned acquisition in November 2018. The consolidated profit and loss
and statement of financial position of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018
presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived from the corresponding comparative
column in the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements (and not from the consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, which are not included
nor incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum).

The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and audited by EY
S.p.A. and contain the English translation of the auditors’ reports included therein.

The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the F-pages to this Offering Memorandum
should be read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto. Prospective investors are advised
to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between IFRS
and U.S. GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how those
differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and
(ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, IFRS may have on our results of
operations or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the
process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements,
are disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The consolidated profit and loss and statement of financial position of the Issuer as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2019 presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived
from the corresponding comparative column in the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements (and
not from the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements), which reclassified certain profit and loss
and financial position line items in the 2019 financial statements for the purpose of presenting
the transactions and financial position between the Issuer and its direct parent company, Design
Holding, separately from the rest of the Issuer’s financial information. These reclassified line
items are: (i) in the consolidated profit and loss statement, “revenues from contracts with
customers”, “personnel costs” and “service costs” and (ii) in the consolidated statement of
financial position, “other non-current assets”, “trade receivables”, “tax assets and other current
assets”, “trade payables” and “tax payables and other current liabities”. We believe such

xvi


-----

reclassification better reflects the structure of the Group, given Group management is located at
the level of Design Holding, whereas the Issuer is the reporting company. For further
information, see “Management”.

**_Revenue Breakdowns_**
For each of the periods under review, we present in this Offering Memorandum the breakdown
of the Issuer’s revenue by brand (Flos, LP and B&B) that reflect our accounting segments under
IFRS 8.

In addition, for each of the periods under review, we present in this Offering Memorandum also
the following breakdowns of the Issuer’s revenue, which do not correspond to segments under
IFRS 8:

- by sales channel:

 - Wholesale, comprising decorative, architectural and outdoor products sold through the Flos
third-party dealer network, home and Arclinea products sold through the B&B wholesale
network and business-to-customer products sold through the Louis Poulsen third-party point
of sale network, each including third-party online sales;

 - Contract, comprising products sold through the Flos contract division, the B&B contract
division and the Louis Poulsen business-to-business division;

 - Directly operated stores (“DOS”), comprising decorative, architectural and outdoor products
sold through Flos’ DOS and home and Arclinea products sold through B&B’s DOS. Louis
Poulsen does not currently have any sales through DOS; and

 - Direct online sales, comprising decorative, architectural and outdoor products sold through
Flos’ direct e-commerce website in the U.S. and business-to-customer products sold through
Louis Poulsen’s direct ecommerce websites in most European countries and the United States.
B&B does not currently have any direct online sales; and

- by geographical area ((i) Italy, (ii) Rest of Europe, (iii) North America and (iv) Asia Pacific region
(“APAC”) and others).

We also present herein certain additional breakdowns of the Issuer’s revenue, such as
breakdowns by product category, country (other than Italy, Rest of Europe, North America and
APAC and others), that do not correspond to segments under IFRS 8 and have been derived from
management accounts and systems. Our revenues under such management accounts are
marginally different from our statutory revenues, mainly in respect of certain deductibles which
are normally taken into account for the purpose of calculating our statutory revenues.

##### Pro Forma Financial Information

In addition, for purposes of facilitating the comparison of our results of operations among the
periods under review, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations” section of this Offering Memorandum also presents the following selected_
pro forma profit and loss items in respect of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2018: (i)
total revenues, (ii) total costs, (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the “2018 Pro Forma
**Information”). For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of**
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the_
_year ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma)”. The 2018 Pro Forma Information gives pro forma_
effect to the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo on November 22, 2018, as
well as all the transactions related to such acquisition, including, inter alia, the equity
contribution by the Sponsors into the Issuer, the issuance of the Existing Notes by the Issuer and
the refinancing of certain previously existing indebtedness of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo, as if
all such events had occurred on January 1, 2018. The 2018 Pro Forma Information has been
prepared by management for illustrative purposes only. Neither our independent auditors or any
other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with

xvii


-----

respect to the 2018 Pro Forma Information for the purpose of its inclusion herein or for any other
purposes and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors or any other independent auditors
have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the
purpose of this Offering Memorandum.

##### Accounting for the Refinancing

A portion of the net proceeds from the Notes will be used to redeem the Existing Floating Rate
Notes. In accordance with IFRS 9, a financial liability should be removed from the statement of
financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished; that is, when the obligation specified
in the relevant contracts are discharged or cancelled or expired. The accounting treatment of a
debt refinancing depends on whether the modified terms (or new debt instrument) are
“substantially different” to the previous terms (or debt instrument). Through the Refinancing,
the Issuer will redeem all of the Existing Floating Rate Notes and is accounted for as
extinguishment of the existing liabilities and the recognition of a new liability at amortized cost.

##### Certain Consolidated Financial Information of YDesign

On April 12, 2021, the Issuer, together with U.S. BidCo and U.S. MergerCo, entered into the
Acquisition Agreement with YDesign and the Seller Representative providing for the acquisition
of YDesign by the U.S. BidCo, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Acquisition”. This Offering Memorandum includes certain selected consolidated financial_
information of YDesign for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021, including the net sales and the Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign, which is
converted from U.S. dollars to euro and added to our Synergized EBITDA to calculate our Pro
Forma Synergized EBITDA.

The Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign is presented in this Offering Memorandum for illustrative
purposes because, when added to our Synergized EBITDA to calculate our Pro Forma Synergized
EBITDA, we believe it provides a useful measure of the combined results of operations of the
Group and YDesign as if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020 or April 1, 2020, as
applicable. However, the Adjusted EBITDA and net sales of YDesign are unaudited, have not
been otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts, and have been derived from
YDesign financial statements and management accounts, which are prepared on the basis of U.S.
GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign and any other financial data of YDesign presented
herein are therefore not comparable with the Adjusted EBITDA and other consolidated financial
information of the Issuer presented herein, which are derived from underlying financial measures
prepared in accordance with IFRS. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S.
GAAP in this Offering Memorandum nor reconcile YDesign U.S. GAAP EBITDA to IFRS. See
“—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial
_Information—The consolidated financial information of YDesign presented herein, including as_
_part of our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, was prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP and is_
_therefore not comparable with the consolidated financial information of the Issuer, which was_
_prepared on the basis of IFRS”._

##### Certain Aggregated Revenue Breakdowns of the Issuer and YDesign

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain breakdowns of the aggregated revenue of the
Issuer and YDesign for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Aggregated 2020 Revenue”) by
product category, brand, sales channel and geographical area (the “Aggregated 2020 Revenue
**Breakdowns”). The Aggregated 2020 Revenue Breakdowns aim to illustrate the various**
categories of revenue, presented by product category, brand, sales channel and geographical
area, giving effect to the Acquisition. The methodology behind the calculation of the
Aggregated 2020 Revenue Breakdowns assumes that YDesign is an internal division of the Group
for the relevant period. It is based on the systematic categorization of types of revenues under

xviii


-----

the same categories by product, brand, sales channel and geographical area, and not following
the categorization used by management of YDesign, and therefore relies on management
estimates. In addition, the Aggregated 2020 Revenue Breakdowns are based on Aggregated 2020
Revenue, which is calculated as the sum of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer, which is
calculated in accordance with IFRS, and the net sales of YDesign, which are calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, as mentioned above under “—Certain Consolidated Financial
_Information of YDesign”. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP in this_
Offering Memorandum nor reconcile YDesign net sales to IFRS.

Therefore, the underlying financial data utilized to calculate Aggregated 2020 Revenue and
Aggregated 2020 Revenue Breakdowns are not comparable. As a result, the Aggregated 2020
Revenue Breakdowns are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, may not give an accurate
or complete picture of our results of operations following the Acquisition and may differ
materially from our actual results, and should not be relied upon when making an investment
decision.

The Aggregated 2020 Revenue Breakdowns are being presented for information purposes
because we believe that they provide a useful measure of our the combined results of operations
of the Issuer and YDesign. However, they have not been audited or reviewed in accordance with
any generally accepted auditing standards and are based on management estimates. Accordingly,
any reliance you place on this information should fully take this into consideration.

##### Acquisition Accounting

The Issuer will account for the Acquisition at fair value applying IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”.
Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer,
including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over
the fair value of the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill.

Since the Acquisition has not been consummated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
we have not identified the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date
of the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to 12 months from the Completion Date
to finalize the purchase price allocation.

##### Non-IFRS Financial Measures

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, in addition to certain
of the Issuer’s revenue breakdowns discussed above (revenue breakdowns by sales channel and
geographical area), including orders, Aggregated 2020 Revenue, Aggregated 2020 Revenue
Breakdowns, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Financial Debt, Synergized
EBITDA, YDesign Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, Pro Forma Cash and Shortterm Deposits, Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt and Pro Forma Cash Interest Expense that
are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. Such non-IFRS measures presented in
this Offering Memorandum are described and defined under “Summary—Summary Historical
_Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Data”._

In evaluating any EBITDA-based metrics presented herein (including Adjusted EBITDA, Synergized
EBITDA, YDesign Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA), you should be aware that,
as analytical tools, such metrics are subject to certain limitations. EBITDA-based metrics are not
measurements of performance or liquidity under IFRS and you should not consider such metrics
as alternatives to (a) gross profit or operating profit (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a
measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flow for the period as a measure of our ability to
meet our cash needs or (c) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We present

xix


-----

such EBITDA-based metrics as we believe that they are measures commonly used by investors and
are measures that we use in managing each of our businesses.

Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that
it provides a useful measure of the combined results of operations the Group and the YDesign
Group. However, this measure does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS
or any other accounting standard and has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside
auditors, consultants or experts. Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA does not purport to indicate our
future consolidated results of operations, including following the Acquisition. The calculation of
Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA is based on various assumptions and management estimates and is
therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and should not be relied upon in isolation
when making an investment decision. Our actual results may differ significantly from those
reflected in our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA for a number of reasons, including, but not limited
to, differences in the accounting standards applied for the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA of
the Group (IFRS) and the Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign (U.S. GAAP) and our ability to realize the
expected synergies from the Acquisition and other synergies. Therefore, Pro Forma Synergized
EBITDA should not be relied upon in isolation when making an investment decision. See
“—Certain Consolidated Financial Information of YDesign” above. See also “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Financial Information—Our Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA_
_presented_ _in_ _this_ _Offering_ _Memorandum_ _are_ _based_ _upon_ _management_ _estimates_ _and_
_assumptions in respect of certain cost savings and revenue synergies. Such estimates and_
_assumptions might prove to be materially incorrect as a result of factors that are beyond our_
_control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors”._

For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA to
our income (loss) for the year, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and
_Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Data”._

Adjusted EBITDA, Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA as used in this Offering
Memorandum are not calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA” is calculated
pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes as described under “Description of Notes” or for
purposes of any of our other indebtedness.

In the section “Summary—Recent Developments—Current Trading for the Three Months Ending
_March 31, 2021 and Current Outlook”, we also present certain unaudited financial information in_
respect of our order intake. Order intake consists of the aggregate expected revenue from all the
orders received from our customers during a particular reference period (regardless of whether
any revenue has been recognized in respect of these orders in such reference period) for services
and projects for which we have signed contracts or in respect of which we have otherwise
received binding commitments from customers. Depending on, among other things, the nature
of the contract and/or the business division involved, we may require that our customers make
advance payments before we include the relevant orders in our database. Made-to-order
products and contract projects are not normally considered orders, until all technical
specifications have been agreed upon with our customers. Moreover, the change of our order
intake between two reference periods is not calculated on a constant currency basis and
therefore reflects the impact of the relevant currency exchange rates trends, thereby affecting
the comparability of this metric between such two periods. Order intake is included in this
Offering Memorandum because we believe that it provides useful information regarding our
business. However, this measure does not constitute a measure of financial performance under
IFRS or any other accounting standard and has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by
outside auditors, consultants or experts. Order intake does not purport to indicate our future
revenue and its calculation is based on various assumptions and management estimates and is
therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual revenue may differ from our
order intake for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unforeseen events or
circumstances, including termination or scaling down of contracts, increased time requirements
to complete the relevant project, delays in commencing the project or other disruptions and
potential litigation associated with the projects to which our order intake refers.

xx


-----

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they are widely used by securities analysts
and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. By
eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused
by factors such as depreciation and amortization, historical cost and age of assets, financing and
capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe that non-IFRS measures can
provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying
operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we believe that non-IFRS measures are regularly
used by the investment community as a means of comparison of companies in our industry.

Different companies and analysts may calculate non-IFRS measures differently, so comparisons
among companies on this basis should be done carefully. The non-IFRS measures may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered
in isolation or be used as a substitute for an analysis of our operating result as reported under
IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under
IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/loss for the period or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing
activities. The non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations
are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to
service interest or principal payments, on our debts;

- although amortization, depreciation and write-downs are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these
non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such
replacements;

- some of the non-recurring and non-core items that we eliminate in calculating Adjusted
EBITDA, Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, reflect cash payments that were
made, or will in the future be made; and

- they have been calculated by aggregating financial information prepared under different
accounting principles and different reporting currencies.

Because of these limitations, our non-IFRS measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash
that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations
by relying primarily on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and using these non-IFRS
measures only to supplement the evaluation of our performance.

##### Non-Financial Operating Data

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this
Offering Memorandum are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial
statements or financial accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by
outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these terms may not be
comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Any or all of these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of
performance under IFRS or any other general accepted accounting principles.

##### Rounding

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information
presented in millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments

##### Overview

We are one of the leading global design companies in the high-end furniture and lighting
markets. We design, produce, distribute and sell high-end lighting and furniture solutions,
through three companies with leading market positions: Flos, an Italian lighting producer, Louis
Poulsen, a Danish lighting producer, and B&B, an Italian furniture producer. With total revenue
of €526.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA of €128.7 million and net profit of €22.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, we are one of the leading companies in the high-end design market
globally. We benefit from the unique brand heritage and iconic products of each of Flos, Louis
Poulsen and B&B and provide a complementary, high-end offering across a broad range of
product categories, brands, sales channels and geographic areas. Following the ongoing
acquisition of YDesign, a leading e-commerce retailer in the U.S. online high-end lighting market
with net sales of USD163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect to
complement our existing Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B businesses by strengthening our U.S. and
online presence.

The joint strategic direction of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B under one combined group, together
with our long-standing relationships with top designers and specifiers, our strong and
recognizable brands, our broad and diversified offering of top quality products, our extensive
geographical footprint and our omni-channel distribution network, has generated, and is
expected to continue generating, revenue and cost synergies since the combination of the three
businesses was completed in November 2018. It has also expanded our customer reach and
product portfolio and positioned us to deliver strong cash generation despite the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 61.8% of our revenue from contracts with
customers from the lighting category, which includes both indoor and outdoor products, with
our lighting brands Flos and Louis Poulsen accounting for 39.0% and 23.4% of our revenue from
contracts with customers and revenues related to Design Holding that are generated by each
brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations, respectively. For the same period, we have
generated 38.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers from the furniture category,
which includes living room and bedroom products, outdoor products and kitchens, that we
design through our furniture brands B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea (all of which belong to the
B&B group), accounting for approximately 26%, approximately 7% and approximately 5% of our
revenues, respectively.

As a global design company, we provide a full range of high-end furniture and lighting solutions
to a diversified customer base of individual consumers, architects, designers and other specifiers
for residential use and businesses around the globe for commercial use through an omni-channel
approach comprising four key sales channels:

(i) _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel comprises over 4,845 brick-and-mortar points of sale_
located around the world across a range of formats, including third-party mono-brand
stores and shop-in-shops, corners and displays within multi-brand design retailers, as well as
online third-party retailers;

(ii) _Contract. Our contract channel delivers bespoke design services for residential and_
commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom-made
products, as well as certain complementary products from third-party producers;

(iii) Directly-Operated Stores (“DOS”). Our DOS channel comprises retail stores that are directly
managed from our headquarters and sell only products from Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B,
either individually by company or in a combination with products from our other
companies, including our two new D-Studio stores which we plan to open during the course
of 2021 in Milan and Copenhagen and which will sell products from all our brands; and

(iv) _Direct online. Our direct online channel consists of our e-commerce websites currently_

America, in respect of both Flos and Louis Poulsen, and the main European countries, in
respect of Louis Poulsen only).

geography:


APAC & others
16%

North America
14%

Our products are distinguished by their design content, combining innovation and technology
with the rich design heritage that characterizes the Italian and Danish traditions. Each of Flos,
Louis Poulsen and B&B maintains a portfolio of iconic products, a number of which have been
popular for more than 50 years and were created in collaboration with some of the most
prestigious designers in the world, including Antonio Citterio, Gaetano Pesce, Achille and Pier
Giacomo Castiglioni, Philippe Starck, Poul Henningsen and Arne Jacobsen. Our products have
received numerous global design awards and are held in the permanent collections of art and
design museums worldwide, including in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art
Institute of Chicago, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris and
La Triennale di Milano in Milan. Throughout our history, our continuous efforts in technology
and product development coupled with our strong relationships with prestigious designers and
our ability to attract up-and-coming design talents have enabled us to complement our heritage
collection with successful new products that have reinforced the growth of each of our brands
over the years.

Our diversified sales organization is supported by a strong digital presence, with a number of
initiatives underway to support the online presence of our companies, including the expansion of
our online business, through the launch of a new state-of-the-art e-commerce platform with the
support of a dedicated in-house team and of our shareholders’ operating partners, and the
Acquisition which will allow for the expansion of our online channel especially in North America.
We are also continuing to expand our DOS presence through the launch of two D-Studio multi

3


-----

brand and multifunctional flagship stores in Copenhagen and Milan, which we expect will open
in 2021, where products from all our brands will be sold singularly or through tailor-made
projects providing “soft-contract” solutions for business-to-customer (“B2C”) and
business-to-business (“B2B”) customers, and through a recently-launched joint venture
partnership with Fendi which we expect to also be supported by a dedicated DOS network. See
“—Recent Developments—Joint Venture with Fendi”.

The ongoing combination of our businesses and brands is still in the process of delivering
revenue and cost synergies, including,among others, the selective expansion of the store
network, the further development of cross-selling among brands and the creation of D-Studios.
We expect that the ongoing integration of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B will also provide
opportunities for cost synergies, including through the transfer of the production of selected
architectural products of Flos and Louis Poulsen to our Spanish facilities and the opening and
recent renovation of the Arclinea headquarters and training center in Caldogno, in north eastern
Italy. Additional synergies are expected to be developed from the integration of the YDesign
Group, primarily through the distribution of our products through the YDesign Group’s online
platform. See “—Our Strategies—Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment
_from Group integration and the Acquisition”._

##### Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages will be:

**_Leadership position in a fragmented market with highly attractive growth prospects_**

We estimate that we are one of the leading global design companies by revenue in the
fragmented high-end lighting and furniture design markets, with €526.1 million in total
revenue, Adjusted EBITDA of €128.7 million and net profit of €22.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. We believe that on a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, we would have
been approximately 1.5 times larger than our closest direct competitor in terms of revenues
based on our analysis of publicly available financial data for 2019. According to the Industry
Report, after contraction in the market due to COVID-19 pandemic, strong signs of rebound have
been witnessed, with the market expecting to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021.

In addition, despite the recent signs of a trend towards consolidation in the office space, the
high-end design market is primarily characterized by smaller competitors, making us one of the
few design groups that can serve a diverse customer base across a variety of product and service
categories and geographies, enabling us to benefit from cross-selling initiatives and giving us the
opportunity to grow through selected strategic acquisitions in the segments where we currently
operate or in complementary adjacent segments. See “—Our Strategies—Pursue strategic
_acquisition opportunities that align with our overall goals and objectives”._

**_Diversified business model across product categories, geography and distribution channels with_**
**_low customer concentration risk_**

Our business is diversified across product categories, geographies and distribution channels. We
currently operate in two product category sectors, lighting and furniture, which generated 61.8%
and 38.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2020,
respectively.

Geographically, our business benefits from a diversified reach, with approximately 140 countries
served and no one country generating more than 13.6% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Customers outside of our home geographies of Italy and Denmark generated
approximately 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with non-European
sales representing 30.6% of our revenue for such period. Customer growth in recent years has
been primarily driven by the North America and the APAC region, with these regions generating


4


-----

14.4% and 14.7% of our revenue for such period. We expect the APAC region and North America
to support rebounding from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to continue to
drive growth, with consistent demand also expected in our home geographies and Western
Europe. We also expect the Acquisition will increase our revenue from customers in North
America by providing access to YDesign Group’s large database of more than 800,000 customers,
of which approximately 250,000 were active in the past 24 months, including architects and
interior designers that are key specifiers in this geography. On a pro forma basis for the
Acquisition, we estimate that our revenues in North America for the year ended December 31,
2020 would have been approximately 32% of our revenue from contracts with customers.

We also benefit from a diversified distribution network comprised of four distribution channels
(wholesale, contract, DOS and direct online sales) enabling us to reach a broad range of
customers in a cost-efficient manner. Our diversified distribution network will further benefit
from the creation of our new e-commerce platform, which will be unified across our brands, and
the Acquisition, which will further foster our online distribution channel and our exposure to the
North American market where we estimate, based also on industry report, that online
penetration of the U.S. home furnishings market will increase from approximately 20% in 2018
to more than one third in 2023.

For further details on our distribution channels, see “—Omni-channel distribution network
_optimizing client reach and maximizing brand strength”._

Finally, in addition to a diversified mix of product categories, geographies and distribution
channels, we benefit from low customer concentration risk. For the year ended December 31,
2020, Flos’ top 20 customers generated 14.4% of Flos’ revenue, with no one customer generating
more than 2.5% of Flos’ revenue, and Louis Poulsen’s top 20 customers generated approximately
22.0% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue, with no single customer generating more than 4.4% of Louis
Poulsen’s revenue. During the same period, B&B’s top 20 customers generated approximately
24.2% of B&B’s revenue, with no single customer accounting for more than 2.1% of B&B’s
revenue.

**_Highly resilient portfolio of iconic designs and breakthrough innovations_**
Our internationally-acclaimed product portfolios represent a balance between timeless heritage
designs and innovative products. Certain iconic designs have become synonymous with our
brands and continue to attract significant customer demand decades after being introduced. We
believe that maintaining these products in our portfolio helps to limit the effect of market trends
and improves our revenue resiliency. Numerous products from each of our brands have received
prestigious international design awards, including the Compasso d’Oro, NYCxDesign Award, IF
Gold Award, FX Interior Design Awards, Danish Design Award and German Design Award, and
are held in the permanent collections of art and design museums such as the Victoria & Albert
Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris
and La Triennale di Milano in Milan, confirming the excellence, renown and appeal of our
designs.

In addition, we believe that the balance between iconic and innovative products in our portfolio
also translates into limited concentration risk in terms of revenue, with the thirty products
representing the top ten best-selling products from each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B
generating in aggregate only approximately 30% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In particular, for the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from Flos’ top
ten best-selling products accounted for approximately 33% of Flos’ revenue, with no one product
representing more than approximately 6% of Flos’ revenue, and revenues from Louis Poulsen’s
top ten best-selling products accounted for approximately 32% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue, with
no single product representing more than approximately 8% of Louis Poulsen’s revenues. During
the same period, revenues from B&B’s top ten best-selling products accounted for approximately


5


-----

25% of B&B’s revenue, with no product accounting for more than approximately 5% of B&B’s
revenue. Many of our products also benefit from high product longevity, with designs from as
early as 1925 continuing to be popular and informing the development and production of new
designs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our iconic products (i.e. lighting products
designed before 1980 and furniture products designed before 2000) accounted for approximately
22% of our revenue.

Our internal research and product development teams work closely with our designers to
continually update and reconfigure iconic pieces to meet the evolving needs and tastes of our
customers while maintaining the identity of each of our brands and the distinctive original
features that loyal customers worldwide have long associated with our products. We also launch
new products on an ongoing basis to complement our portfolio of heritage designs. We estimate
that we generated 36.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the sale of
products which each of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen introduced during the last five years.
Between 2018 and 2020, Flos, LP and B&B launched approximately 16, 14 and 22 new products
(including extensions of existing product lines) on average per year, respectively. Our efforts in
research and product development and innovation in both design and technology ensure both
the longevity of our iconic products and the continued introduction of creative and successful
new designs.

**_Omni-channel distribution network optimizing client reach and maximizing brand strength_**
We operate our brands through four distribution channels: wholesale, contract, DOS and direct
online sales. We believe our omni-channel distribution network optimizes client reach and
maximizes the strength of our brands. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the wholesale
channel generated approximately 73.3%, the contract channel approximately 19.7%, the DOS
network approximately 6.2% and direct online sales approximately 0.8% of our revenue from
contracts with customers, respectively. On a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, we estimate that
our online sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been approximately 22% of
our revenue from contracts with customers.

_Wholesale_
Within the wholesale channel, we sell Flos products through approximately 2,300 third-party
dealers, Louis Poulsen through 1,650 third-party multi-brand points of sale and B&B’s products
through 59 mono-brand stores, 32 shop-in-shops and 781 multi-brand stores spread around the
globe. These include brick-and-mortar sales points and online third-party dealers, in a range of
formats from third-party mono-brand stores to shops-in-shops, corners and displays located in
third-party multi-brand stores. The wholesale channel enables us to increase customer reach
while limiting distribution costs. We benefit from long-standing customer relationships within
our wholesale channel, with many of our dealers having sold products from our respective brands
for five years or more.

_Contract_
Our contract channel gives us the opportunity to interact with a separate consumer demographic
that is not typically accessible through traditional retail outlets, such as those in the hospitality,
retail, residential design and office industries. Among some of the notable recent projects
completed by the Contract division are the One Thousand Museum by Zaha Hadid Architects in
Miami, The Polaris Lounge by Studio SCB Chicago, the Bulgari Hotel in Shanghai, Beijing and
Milan by Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel, The Retreat at Blue Lagoon Iceland by Basalt
Architects and Design Group Italia, the Aman Canal Grande hotel in Venice, the Café Royal, the
Bulgari Hotel and the Me Hotel in London, the Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan, the Peninsula
Hotel in Paris, the executive offices of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in Abu Dhabi and the
Aman Amanera hotel in Santo Domingo. We believe the wide variety of commercial customers
and the larger scale of contract projects make our contract channel a strong vehicle for crossselling opportunities, increasing the visibility of our products and our market penetration.

-----

Although a large proportion of contract work is currently driven by B&B, the combination of our
brands has provided us with the opportunity to broaden the scope of our contract work, offering
a floor-to-ceiling contract service encompassing furnishings from B&B, kitchens from Arclinea and
lighting solutions from Flos and Louis Poulsen. The D-Studio initiative will further develop this
integration by providing “soft-contract” solutions to both B2B and B2C customers through
specific points of sales.

_DOS_
Our DOS distribution channel is a powerful marketing tool that drives brand awareness, allows
full control over our brands and often provides enhanced visibility to our end customers. As of
December 31, 2020, Flos and B&B operated a total of five and ten DOS, respectively, and Louis
Poulsen had seven showrooms (which while not operated as points of sale, are an important
vehicle for driving sales, as customers who visit showrooms are encouraged to make purchases
through the Louis Poulsen e-commerce site using sales terminals located in each showroom), all
located in key luxury markets around the world in cities such as Milan, London, New York, Paris,
Tokyo and Hong Kong. In addition, as part of the integration process of our brands, we have
recently also broadened the range of products on display at certain of our DOS, featuring, for
example, selected Louis Poulsen and/or Flos lighting solutions in B&B DOS, thereby increasing
cross-selling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such products.
DOS and directly-operated showrooms are a highly valuable distribution channel as they not only
drive sales, but also increase brand strength, serving as a hub for marketing events and design
fairs. Additional contribution to our existing DOS network will come from the D-Studio initiative
which is expected to launch its first stores in Milan and Copenhagen over the course of 2021 and
from the marketing of Fendi-branded products which we expect will rely on a dedicated store
network.

_Direct Online Sales_
While currently only utilized in select markets by Flos and Louis Poulsen, we believe direct online
sales represent a strong growth opportunity for us. Although B&B does not currently conduct any
direct online sales, the new e-commerce platform which we expect to launch during the course
of 2021 will provide an integrated back-end solution powering different websites for all the
brands of the Group. In addition, the Acquisition is expected to provide an additional platform
for the distribution of our products in North America and particularly B&B products which are
currently not sold through the YDesign Group platforms.

Each of our brands also benefits from a strong digital channel and social media presence, which
supports brand awareness across all of our distribution channels and supports earlier customer
acquisition, as compared to traditional sales channels. B&B’s corporate website, bebitalia.com,
received an average of 1.3 million visits each month in the year ended December 31, 2020. Flos
launched a new corporate website in December 2017, which received a Digital Design Award (a
recognition awarded by an international jury for the best of Italian digital design) for Best
Corporate Website and being named SiteInspire’s Site of the Week and which in the first three
months of 2021 received approximately 362 thousand unique visitors each month on average,
which represents a 26% increase compared to the monthly average for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, our brands have enhanced ther presence on social media in
recent years, with large fan bases and followers across all the main platforms, including
Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Twitter.

**_Unique brand power based on design heritage, iconic products, long-standing relationships with_**
**_top designers and loyal networks of specifiers in local markets_**
Our business benefits from significant competitive advantages that make our business model
difficult to replicate, including our iconic product portfolio, design heritage, long-standing
relationships with top designers and specifiers and strong technical know-how. Our iconic brands
benefit from association with a broad base of prestigious and globally renowned designers, such


7


-----

as Philippe Starck, Antonio Citterio, Jasper Morrison, Patricia Urquiola, Piero Lissoni, Barber &
Osgerby, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Konstantin Grcic, Vincent Van Duysen, Marcel Wanders
and Michael Anastassiades at Flos, Poul Henningsen, Vilhelm Lauritzen, Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl
and Verner Panton at Louis Poulsen and Antonio Citterio, Naoto Fukusawa, Jeffrey Bernett,
Studio Kairos, Massaud, Gaetano Pesce, Buratti, Piero Lissoni and Vincent Van Duysen. We believe
our privileged relationships with such designers and our ability to attract new promising
designers represent a significant competitive advantage. Our relationship with designers is
mutually beneficial, as it allows us to expand our brand recognition across a wider customer
demographic and adds value for the designers, who gain prestige and visibility by working with
leading furniture and lighting brands. Some of our designers have collaborated with our brands
for many years, creating a strong design relationship and mutual understanding of the needs and
preferences of our customer base. Many of our designer partners have received multiple awards
and recognitions for their designs and have their designs held in the collections of museums
around the world. For more information on our contractual arrangements with designers, see
“Our Business—Flos—Agreements with Designers”, “Our Business—Louis Poulsen—Agreements
_with Designers” and “Our Business—B&B—Agreements with Designers”._

Designers collaborate closely with our internal research and product development teams, which
have accumulated extensive technical expertise and industry knowledge over decades and
continually support our design innovation. The research and product development teams add
substantial value to designers, providing an extensive knowledge base on product feasibility with
respect to design, materials and market success; research on the latest trends, materials and
technological innovations; design and development support for concepts, prototypes and molds;
negotiation support with suppliers to ensure high component quality standards at competitive
prices; and centralized assembly process and production planning. In addition, management
teams at each of our brands ensure that any new design that is being proposed or considered
internally is fully consistent with the relevant brand’s image and philosophy, which we believe is
key to the success of any product and the continued integrity of our brands.

In addition to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with world-renowned designers to
create unique pieces for our product portfolio, we also benefit from strong relationships with a
widespread network of specifiers, especially smaller, committed professional design and
architecture studios that continually choose and promote our products to meet the design needs
of their clients. We consider these specifiers, which we define as any party that is involved in the
purchasing decision but is not the end user of our products, including but not limited to
architects, interior designers, lighting engineers and landscape architects, a loyal and resilient
customer intermediary that, through repeat business, provides us with a significant competitive
advantage locally in the geographic markets we serve and add to our recognition with end
customers.

**_Strong financial profile with proved resiliency and cash generation during the COVID-19_**
**_outbreak_**

Our brands have demonstrated business resilience throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, as
evidenced by our 2020 end-of-year results. Our total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2020 were €526.1 million and €128.7 million, respectively, marking a 6.9%
decrease and a 1.2% increase with respect to the year ended December 31, 2019. As a producer
of high-end design products, we believe our retail end customer base has significant disposable
income and tends to be less affected by the economic cycle than customers in other segments. In
addition, over the last year we have put in place specific initiatives to increase our economic
resiliency, mainly reducing discretionary spend and other costs associated with activities that
were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and marketing related expenses,
including as a result of the cancellation of fairs and other events, and reducing our fixed costs by
outsourcing certain manufacturing processes to carefully selected third-party assemblers. We
believe that we may continue to benefit from some of these initiatives, in particular those


8


-----

relating to the digitalization of our marketing activities, also after the end of the pandemic. In
addition, we have continued to pursue an increasing diversification of our business, with the
most relevant country only accounting for approximately 13.6% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The introduction of LED products has also resulted in reduced
operating costs for Flos and Louis Poulsen over the last few years, while at the same time
improving the duration of the underlying products.

Our strong cash generation has historically been driven primarily by high profitability levels and
low capital expenditure. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased during the COVID-19
outbreak, from 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 24.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. At the same time, our cash generation has continued steadily throughout
2020, with adjusted net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities) decreasing from
€667.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €632.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In this context, the Acquisition is expected to further strengthen our
resiliency and financial profile, given YDesign strong growth performance in the year ended
December 31, 2020 (despite COVID-19 outbreak, net sales and Adjusted EBITDA increased by
10.2% and 11.0%, respectively) and our exposure to the growing U.S. online high-end design
market.

Our business is characterized by limited capital expenditure requirements, with capital
expenditures as a percentage of revenues representing only 4.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. We expect our maintenance capital expenditure requirements as a
percentage of total revenues to remain broadly in line with such level. However, in light of our
strong cash generation performance in the past two years and the resiliency of our business
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to increase our growth-related capital expenditures in
the next few years to achieve better access to end customers, and further strengthen our
leadership position in the market. In particular, we expect such increased investments to focus
on, among other things, actions to accelerate the digital transformation of the Group (e.g.,
implementation of the new e-commerce platform and the update of the Group’s enterprise
resource planning (ERP) and enterprise performance management (EPM) systems) and common
initiatives among the brands to strengthen our distribution in selected growing markets. See
“—Our Strategies”. For more information on our capital expenditures, see also “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures”._

In addition, a significant part of our production, in particular that associated with our furniture
solutions, is typically made to order. The make-to-order approach we adopt for a large portion of
our products enables us to maintain control over the value chain. In addition, where we do not
operate on a make-to-order basis, the long lifespan of our products lowers inventory risk.
Moreover, approximately 54% of our cost base is variable for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition, we believe that our brand strength gives us strong pricing power, typically allowing
us to pass the effects of increased raw material and component costs or adverse exchange rate
fluctuations to our customers.

**_Experienced_** **_management_** **_team_** **_backed_** **_by_** **_a_** **_strong_** **_holding_** **_structure_** **_and_** **_committed_**
**_shareholders_**
All the Group companies operate under the strategic guidance of the management and of the
board of directors of Design Holding. At Design Holding level, our former Chief Executive Officer
Gabriele Del Torchio will remain with the Group as non-executive Chairman, continuing to
contribute to the development of our business. A search for a new Chief Executive Officer of
Design Holding is ongoing and will follow the most rigorous international standards. Design
Holding has also recently reinforced its holding structure through the hires of a centralized
management team in charge of overseeing the overall operations of the Group and coordinating
with each operating company. Such team will include a Group Chief Digital Officer, Group Head
of Contract, Group Head of Marketing, Group Head of Human Resources, Group Head of
E-commerce and Group Head of China. All of our recently hired personnel have long-standing


9


-----

experience and proved track-record in their respective fields. See “Management”. Additionally,
the executive teams at Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B are highly experienced in leading and
growing successful design businesses, with relevant prior experience at large international
companies. We expect that, as part of the Acquisition, certain members of the current
management team of YDesign will reinvest a portion of their respective proceeds into U.S. BidCo,
corresponding to approximately 2% of its issued and outstanding equity interests. See
“Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition”.

This experienced management team is backed by our principal shareholders, Investindustrial and
Carlyle, each of which has successfully invested in the design and luxury industries both in Europe
and worldwide. We believe that our current management team and ownership structure will
allow us to continue to attract and retain the industry’s top talent, further driving profitable
growth. See “Principal Shareholders”.

##### Our Strategies
The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Expand our geographic reach especially in selected growing markets_**
As part of our initiative to grow our store network, we plan to also strategically expand our
geographic reach in markets where we expect to see continued growth, particularly outside of
Europe. We aim to expand the reach of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B within North America and
the Asia Pacific region (“APAC”). Moreover, expansion in China is one of our strategic priorities
and, to that end, we have appointed a Group Head of China who will oversee the commercial
efforts in the region, including the opening of local stores, the roll-out of mono-brand stores
with local partners and a digital-led marketing strategy to generate brand awareness and
support distribution of products in the area. In addition, the Acquisition is expected to further
foster our market penetration in North America, which will give us access to YDesign Group’s
large database of more than 800,000 customers, including architects and interior designers that
are key specifiers in this geography. See also “—Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that
_align with our overall goals and objectives”._

**_Develop our store network and foster growth of our online segment_**
As part of the integration process of our brands, we have recently broadened the range of
products on display at certain of our DOS, featuring, for example, selected Louis Poulsen and/or
Flos lighting solutions in B&B DOS in an environment designed to enhance the design identity of
each brand while at the same time emphasizing the relationship among the products, thereby
increasing cross-selling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such
products. In addition, we are developing the D-Studio initiative consisting of the creation of
multi-brand and multifunctional flagship stores representing unified points of sales where all
products will be sold individually or through tailor-made projects providing “soft-contract”
solutions for B2C and B2B customers. The D-Studio pioneering initiative aims at maximizing the
cross-selling potential among our brands. We expect the first D-Studio stores to open in
Copenhagen and Milan over the course of 2021, which might be trailblazers of additional
D-Studio stores in the future. We expect to continue to grow our store network through the
recently-launched joint venture partnership with Fendi, which contemplates the opening of a
large network of dedicated DOS for the sale of Fendi-branded design products manufactured by
us. In addition to the above, we are currently planning the roll-out of our new e-commerce
platform which we expect to be initially launched with Flos before the end of 2021 to target the
main markets in continental Europe and the U.K., to then expand to the other Group companies
and geographies. Finally, the Acquisition is expected to further expand our online segment and
strengthen our presence in the North American market. After giving pro forma effect to the
Acquisition, we estimate that the portion of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020
represented by online sales would have been approximately 22%. In addition to online sales, we
intend to continue to develop digital relationships with our existing and potential customers,


10


-----

including through online marketing, social media outreach, online sales support, digital product
configurators and partnering with social media influencers to promote our products and
visibility.

**_Continue to strengthen and extend our product portfolio_**

Our product portfolio is a key element of our success, and we intend to continue to invest in
research and product development with the aim of further strengthening and extending this
portfolio both with redesigns or new configurations of existing products and introductions of
new, complementary designs. We intend to continue adapting to evolving technology while
building on the strength and success of our timeless iconic products. We expect to continue to
launch new products and to coordinate our marketing and advertising efforts through a single
and pre-defined strategy for the Group. Between 2018 and 2020, Flos, LP and B&B launched
approximately 16, 14 and 22 new products (including extensions of existing product lines) on
average each year, respectively, a rate of new product launches that we expect to continue.

**_Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment from Group integration and the_**
**_Acquisition_**

Our key operational priority, along with maintaining and improving our high quality standards,
is to finalize the deployment of synergies from the creation of Design Holding. Management
estimates a potential €6.0 million of expected run-rate annual revenue and cost synergies
positively impacting our Adjusted EBITDA in the medium-term. In particular, revenue synergies
include estimated incremental annual run-rate EBITDA of €4.7 million we expect to generate in
2022 from sales from our two D-Studio stores that we plan to open during 2021 and sales of our
products on the centralized e-commerce platform that we plan to launch in 2021. Cost synergies
include estimated run-rate annual cost savings of €1.3 million from initiatives that we have
already started implementing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, related to the
transfer of the production of selected architectural products of Flos and Louis Poulsen to our
Spanish facilities and the opening and recent renovation of the Arclinea headquarters and
training center in Caldogno, in northeastern Italy. We also expect to achieve €3.2 million of
additional annual run-rate revenue synergies from the Acquisition, which we expect to fully
realize in 2022, mainly deriving from (i) sales on the YDesign platform of our products, including
B&B products which are currently not sold by YDesign and (ii) revenues from the sale of
YDesign’s private label products which YDesign is currently considering to set up in categories
which we do not expect to compete with the Group products. For additional information,
including on expected minor one-off costs and capital expenditure which are not reflected in
these adjustments, see “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other
_Financial and Pro Forma Data”._

**_Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that align with our overall goals and objectives_**

Our global footprint and diverse product portfolio create opportunities for acquisitions of
selected brands in the high-end design market or adjacent markets that may bolster or
complement our existing offering and geographical footprint. We are open to considering and
we constantly scrutinize additional strategic acquisitions, some of which could be significant in
size, to add to our portfolio, capitalize on our competitive strengths, expand our geographic
footprint and reach in jurisdictions, including outside of Europe, where we see potential growth
opportunities and/or where we currently have limited operations, further diversify our product
offering, preserve or improve our financial performance and/or benefit from further
consolidation expected in the design industry. Any further potential acquisition opportunities
will be evaluated in light of a prudent and rigorous analysis to preserve a strong financial
position. We will continue to apply a disciplined approach to pricing in connection with these
potential acquisitions and will place significant emphasis on carefully planning and executing our
acquisition strategy. As part of this strategy and to the extent possible, we will aim to use the
investments we have already made in our IT, finance, operational, governance and business


11


-----

processes to reduce costs associated with on-boarding acquired businesses and will aim to utilize
these synergies to benefit the entire Group.

**_Continue to leverage and nurture our relationships across the design value chain_**
In addition to our long-standing relationships with top designers that form a key competitive
advantage, we also benefit significantly from positive relationships with loyal specifiers,
particularly from the architect and designer community serving the local markets where we are
present. These specifiers raise our profile and support our success across the value chain from the
creation of the designs, to the development of the products and the final distribution to
customers. We intend to continue fostering these long-standing relationships, which in turn
support our ability to attract and retain new designers and promote our products to new
specifiers. We believe that operating as a single one-stop-shop under one joint strategic direction
will enable us to increase our ability to attract new talents and enhance the visibility of our
brands. See “—Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment from Group
_integration and the Acquisition”._

##### The Issuer
The Issuer is a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated in Italy and is registered with
the Companies’ register of Milan-Monza-Brianza-Lodi under registration number and fiscal code
10462810960. The registered office of the Issuer is at Via Alessandro Manzoni, 38, 20121 Milan,
Italy.

##### The Transactions

 The Refinancing

redeem the Existing Floating Rate Notes at a price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount


12


-----

thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and
additional amounts, if any (the “Refinancing”). For purposes of the Refinancing:

(i) €228.3 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the
Issuer to, among others, finance the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish
HoldCo and to fund a portion of the Danish HoldCo I/C Loan to Danish HoldCo, will be
redeemed with proceeds from Tranche A (as defined under “Sources and Uses”) under the
Notes;

(ii) €52.9 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the
Issuer to fund a portion of the Flos I/C Loan to Flos, will be redeemed with the proceeds
from Tranche B (as defined under “Sources and Uses”) under the Notes; and

(iii) €38.8 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the
Issuer to fund a portion of the B&B I/C Loan to B&B, will be redeemed with the proceeds
from Tranche C (as defined under “Sources and Uses”) under the Notes.

We expect that the Existing Floating Rate Notes will be satisfied and discharged on the Issue Date
and ultimately redeemed shortly thereafter.

**_The Acquisition_**

On April 12, 2021, the Issuer (only as the guarantor of the pre-closing obligations of U.S. BidCo
(as defined below) under the Acquisition Agreement (as defined below) to the extent not
performed by U.S. BidCo), together with IDG Apollo Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
newly-formed and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer (“U.S. BidCo”), IDG Apollo Merger Sub
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a newly-formed and wholly-owned subsidiary of
U.S. BidCo (“U.S. MergerCo”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Acquisition
**Agreement”) with YDesign and Alpine Management Services III, LLC, as representative of the**
holders of equity interests of and employee appreciation bonuses granted by YDesign (the
“Seller Representative”) providing for the acquisition of YDesign through the merger of
U.S. MergerCo with and into YDesign, with YDesign surviving the merger (the “Acquisition” or
the “Target Merger”).

As a result of and at the effective time of the Target Merger (the “Effective Time”), the existence
of U.S. MergerCo will automatically cease and YDesign will continue as the surviving company
and as a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. BidCo. At the Effective Time, all of the
membership interest units (other than the equity interests of YDesign held by it in treasury or by
U.S. BidCo, U.S. MergerCo or any of their respective subsidiaries) and vested profits interests of
YDesign issued and outstanding immediately prior to thereto, along with the vested equity
appreciation bonuses granted by YDesign to certain employees of YDesign, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Target Merger consideration. At the Effective
Time, the unvested profits interests of YDesign and unvested equity appreciation bonuses will be
forfeited and cancelled for no consideration.

We expect that, as part of the Acquisition, immediately prior to the Target Merger, certain
members of the current management team of YDesign will reinvest a portion of their respective
proceeds into U.S. BidCo (the “Target Management Reinvestment”), as a result of which,
immediately following the consummation of the Target Merger, the Issuer is expected to hold
approximately 98% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of U.S. BidCo and such of
YDesign’s management team are expected to collectively hold approximately 2% of the issued
and outstanding equity interests of U.S. BidCo. As negotiations in respect of the Target
Management Reinvestment are still ongoing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we
cannot exclude the possibility that YDesign management will reinvest the relevant proceeds at
the level of YDesign, as opposed to U.S. BidCo. In addition to the Target Management
Reinvestment, we expect to put in place customary compensation schemes as of or immediately


13


-----

following the Completion Date, which in the future may result in the issuance of further equity
interests of the relevant entity to YDesign management.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the consummation of the Acquisition, and by
extension all transactions related thereto, are subject to, among other customary conditions:
(i) expiration or termination of the waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) applicable
to the Acquisition under any relevant antitrust or competition laws (the “Antitrust Laws”), such
as the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), or
(ii) otherwise obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, notices and filings as may be required under the Antitrust Laws, including as a
result of any filing with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is
_subject to a number of conditions, which, if not fulfilled or if not fulfilled in a timely manner,_
_may result in termination of the Acquisition Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to the receipt of governmental clearance that may_
_impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the parties or, if not obtained, could_
_prevent consummation of the Acquisition”._

The Acquisition consideration will be determined at the Completion Date in accordance with the
provisions of the Acquisition Agreement and will depend on, inter alia, certain customary
adjustments for cash, transaction expenses, indebtedness and other debt-like items and
normalized working capital above or below a certain target level. For further information, see
“—Sources and Uses”. The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights of YDesign
and U.S. BidCo, including the right of each party to terminate if the transactions contemplated by
the Acquisition Agreement have not been consummated prior to or on October 12, 2021.

##### The Financing of the Acquisition
On or prior to the Completion Date, following the Escrow Release (as defined below), we expect
that the Issuer will use the net proceeds from the Notes available under Tranche A (as defined
under “Sources and Uses”) thereunder released from the Escrow Account and certain available
cash on balance sheet, in each case converted into USD, to transfer approximately $180.4 million
to U.S. BidCo by way of an equity contribution of approximately $108.2 million and an
intercompany loan for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $72.2 million (the “U.S.
**BidCo Proceeds Loan”). The amount of such equity contribution and/or the U.S. BidCo Proceeds**
Loan may vary from the above estimated amount due to a number of factors, including the
timing of the Completion Date, the amount reinvested by certain members of the current
management team of YDesign as part of the Target Management Reinvestment and the
fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering
Memorandum and the Completion Date. We may enter into hedging arrangements to hedge
against such exchange rate risk. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions” and
“—Escrow Account”.

U.S. BidCo will use the proceeds from such equity contribution and the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan
to fund the consideration payable on the Completion Date under the Acquisition Agreement,
fully repay and discharge certain minor existing indebtedness of the Target and pay fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition.

We refer to the offering of the Notes hereby, the Refinancing, the Acquisition and any actions or
steps related thereto, collectively, as the “Transactions”.

##### Escrow Account
Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the
issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit €150.0 million of gross proceeds from the
offering of the Notes available under Tranche A (as defined under “Sources and Uses”) under the
Notes into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be in the name of the Issuer, controlled


14


-----

by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.
The release of the escrowed proceeds from the Escrow Account (the “Escrow Release”) will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition
pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement within two Business Days following the
Escrow Release. If the conditions to the Escrow Release have not been satisfied on or prior to
November 20, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), the Issuer will be required to redeem Notes
with an aggregate issue price equal to €150.0 million at a redemption price equal to the issue
price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to but excluding such
special mandatory redemption date and additional amounts, if any. The redeemed Notes shall be
selected pro rata for redemption from all of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”._

##### Sources and Uses
The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
are shown in the table below. Actual amounts are subject to adjustment and may differ from
these estimated amounts, depending on several factors, including the amount of debt, cash and
cash equivalents held by the Target, the amount reinvested by certain members of the current
management team of the Target as part of the Target Management Reinvestment and the actual
amount of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with, the timing of the Completion Date
and the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering
Memorandum and the Completion Date. This table should be read in conjunction with “Use of
_Proceeds” and “Capitalization”._

(1) Assumes the Notes will be issued at par.
(2) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will
use a portion of the proceeds from the Notes offered hereby and available cash on balance sheet to deposit with the trustee
for holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes (or an agent thereof) an amount sufficient to redeem the Existing Floating
Rate Notes in full (including accrued interest to, but excluding, the expected date of redemption). In particular, for purposes
of the Refinancing: (i) €228.3 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to,
among others, finance the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo and to fund a portion of the Danish
HoldCo I/C Loan to Danish HoldCo, will be redeemed with proceeds from tranche “A” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is
expected to be equal to approximately €378.3 million (“Tranche A”); (ii) €52.9 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the
proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the Flos I/C Loan to Flos, will be redeemed with proceeds from
tranche “B” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is expected to be equal to approximately €52.9 million (“Tranche B”); and
(iii) €38.8 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the
B&B I/C Loan to B&B, will be redeemed with the proceeds from tranche “C” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is expected
to be equal to approximately €38.8 million (“Tranche C”). We expect that the Existing Floating Rate Notes will be redeemed
in full on the Issue Date or shortly thereafter, as notified to the holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes pursuant to the
conditional notice of redemption dated May 10, 2021. See also “Capitalization”. For further information on Tranche A,
Tranche B and Tranche C, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at_
identifying the separate portions of the proceeds of the Offering being used to consummate the Acquisition and the various
elements of the Refinancing, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or common codes) for each
such tranche.
(3) Represents accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Floating Rate Notes from May 15, 2021 (which is the next interest
payment date) to, but excluding, an estimated date of redemption of May 20, 2021. See also footnote (1) under
“Capitalization” where we have adjusted our Cash and short-term deposits for, inter alia, the payment of accrued interest on
the Existing Notes to be made on May 15, 2021.
(4) Represents the estimated euro amount required to complete the Acquisition to be partially funded with the proceeds from
Tranche A under the Notes. The total amount required to complete the Acquisition on the Completion Date may vary from
the amount indicated due to a number of factors, including the effect of adjustments to the Acquisition consideration
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the timing of the Completion Date, the amount reinvested by certain members of
the current management team of YDesign as part of the Target Management Reinvestment and the fluctuation of the


15


-----

U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering Memorandum and the Completion Date. We may enter
into hedging arrangements to hedge against such exchange rate risk. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions”,
“—The Transactions—The Acquisition”, “—The Transactions—Escrow Account” and “Capitalization”.
(5) Represents estimated transaction costs associated with the Transactions, including initial purchaser discounts, commitment
and financial advisory fees, hedging fees (if any) and other transaction costs and professional expenses to be partially funded
with the proceeds from Tranche A under the Notes.

##### Recent Developments

**_Current Trading for the Three Months Ending March 31, 2021 and Current Outlook_**

_The preliminary indications set forth below are based on an initial review of our and YDesign’s_
_results of operations from the respective management accounts. Neither our nor YDesign’s_
_independent auditors or any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or_
_performed any procedures with respect to such preliminary unaudited financial information for_
_the purpose of its inclusion herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly, neither our nor_
_YDesign’s independent auditors or any other independent auditors have expressed an opinion or_
_provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering_
_Memorandum. Furthermore, the preliminary unaudited financial information below does not_
_take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the period to which it refers. The_
_preliminary unaudited information set forth below regarding our and YDesign’s results for the_
_periods indicated is based on management accounts and systems and in part on estimates. We_
_believe the estimates underlying the financial information presented below may provide_
_investors with a helpful indication of the development of our and YDesign’s results of operations_
_following December 31, 2020. However, our actual results for the first quarter of 2021 may differ_
_materially from the trends and ranges included herein. The preliminary information set forth_
_below should not be regarded as an indication, forecast, capsule financial information or_
_representation regarding our financial results for the three months ending March 31, 2021 and_
_neither our nor YDesign’s independent auditors will audit, review, compile or perform any_
_procedures with respect to such preliminary unaudited financial information. You should_
_therefore not place undue reliance on the preliminary information presented below. The_
_information presented below also includes our total sales and information on our EBITDA margin_
_adjusted for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, which have been derived from_
_our management accounts to improve comparability with the preliminary figures for the three_
_months ending March 31, 2021. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent_
_auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such_
_financial information. The revenue recognition and measurement criteria we utilize in our_
_management accounts are different from those we utilize in our statutory accounts. Therefore,_
_total sales and operating results from our management accounts are marginally different from_
_revenues and operating results deriving from our statutory accounts and consolidated financial_
_statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Presentation of financial and_
_other information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures”._

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not finalized trading results for the three
months ending March 31, 2021. However, based on preliminary results derived from our
unaudited management accounts and other information currently available to management, we
estimate our total sales for the three months ending March 31, 2021 to be between €144 million
and €148 million, compared to €121.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and
€125.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The expected increase was primarily
driven by Louis Poulsen’s and B&B’s strong performance in the residential market in the Nordics
and continental Europe. In the first quarter of 2021, despite the modest results we achieved in
our Contract channel mainly as a consequence of the protracted adverse effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, the otherwise strong performance of all our brands resulted in the growth of our
order intake for such period by approximately 33% compared to the same period in 2020 and
approximately 31% compared to the same period in 2019.


16


-----

In addition, we estimate our EBITDA margin adjusted for the three months ending March 31,
2021 to be marginally higher than the EBITDA margin adjusted for the year ended December 31,
2020, representing an increase compared to an EBITDA margin adjusted of 18.8% for the three
months ended March 31, 2020 and 18.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The
expected EBITDA margin adjusted increase was primarily attributable to our positive
performance in the period as well as the impact of certain one-off costs in connection with the
remodeling of one of our DOS in Milan which we expect to re-open during the course of 2021 in
our new “D-Studio” format.

Based on preliminary results derived from YDesign’s unaudited management accounts and other
information currently available, we estimate that YDesign’s net sales increased to approximately
U.S.$174 million (or approximately €150 million) for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021,
from U.S.$163.2 million (or €143.6 million) for the year ended December 31, 2020, and YDesign’s
EBITDA adjusted increased to approximately U.S.$14 million (or approximately €12 million) for
the twelve months ending March 31, 2021, from U.S.$13.3 million (or €11.7 million) for the year
ended December 31, 2020, mainly as a result of the growth of the business, which delivered
particularly strong revenue and gross margin performance in the first quarter of 2021, which was
partially offset by increased marketing costs for the Consumer segment. See "Business—
_YDesign"._

On the basis of the above preliminary estimated unaudited results and additional management
considerations, we estimate our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA for the twelve months ending
March 31, 2021 to be between €164 million and €167 million, compared to €152.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020, with the amount of estimated synergies included in such
period being marginally lower than the amount for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our
Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt (net of IFRS 16 lease liabilities) as of March 31, 2021 to be
approximately €771.4 million, compared to €787.4 million as of December 31, 2020. See
_“Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma_
_Data” for information on our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted Net_
Financial Debt.

Although the ultimate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets where we operate are
still uncertain as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, as the main economies around the
world are slowly healing, we expect that the improving global economic outlook will result in a
continuation of the positive trends we have experienced in the first quarter of 2021. We expect
our efforts to expand our store and online networks through, among other things, the launch of
a joint e-commerce platform, our “D-Studio” initiative and the acquisition of YDesign, to
increase the digitalization of our business model and modernize our IT infrastructure, to control
our operating costs and finalize the deployment of synergies from the creation of Design
Holding, will continue to support our revenue growth and cash flow generation and further
stabilize our profitability in the short to medium term. For more information on these initiatives,
see “—Our Strategies”. See also “Forward-Looking Statements”.

**_Joint Venture with Fendi_**
On May 3, 2021, we announced joint venture partnership Fashion Furniture Design S.p.A.
(“FF Design”) with Maison FENDI (“Fendi”), an Italian luxury brand that is part of the LVMH
Group, in order to develop the “Fendi Casa” business. Design Holding, through the Issuer, is the
majority shareholder of FF Design.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, FF Design has already been developing the new
Fendi Casa collections that we plan to present at the 2022 Salone del Mobile design fair in Milan.
We expect such collections to be available for sale through carefully selected third-party points of
sale as well as a network of new mono-brand shops. We expect FF Design to be fully operational
and start making sales from January 2022.


17


-----

As part of this project, we have also created a new company, Design Quality Manufacturing
S.p.A. (which is directly wholly owned by the Issuer), which will oversee the entire manufacturing
of the Fendi Casa collections. The operations of such company are based in the B&B Italia
production plant in Misinto (north of Milan, in the Brianza area) and will benefit from our
superior know-how in product development and made in Italy production. In 2021, we expect to
make approximately €6 million of investments in FF Design, mainly in respect of the factory setup, the opening of two new mono-brand DOS in Milan and Paris and the integration of the
information technology system.

We believe that through FF Design we will be able to combine the design development qualities
and powerful heritage of the Fendi brand and our unique know-how to create a brand that has
the potential to benefit from both the tradition and innovation typical to the Fendi brand, on
the one hand, and our leadership in the international high-end design market, on the other. We
also believe that a joint venture with a brand such as Fendi, which combines tradition and
modernity, will provide us with the opportunity to further consolidate our presence in
international markets, specifically in Asia. Furthermore, FF Design is aligned with our strategies
to expand our business geographically and further strengthen and extend our product portfolio.
For more information on our strategies, see “Summary—Our Strategies”.

(1) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, each of Carlyle and Investindustrial have joint beneficial ownership, indirectly
through intermediate holding companies, of approximately 96% of the share capital of the Issuer. Certain employees and
members of management indirectly hold, via Design Holding S.p.A. (“Design Holding”), approximately 2% of the share
capital of the Issuer and the Issuer indirectly owns, via Design Holding, the remaining approximately 2% of its share capital.
See “Principal Shareholders”.
(2) The management team that oversee the operations of the Group is employed by Design Holding. For further information, see
“Management”.
(3) The Issuer is a holding company incorporated under the laws of Italy as a joint stock company (società per azioni). See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue_
_generating operations of its own and depends exclusively on cash from its operating companies, including, following the_
_Acquisition, the Target Group”._
(4) On the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer, will not be guaranteed and will be secured on a firstranking basis by Escrow Charge. Subject to certain agreed security principles and certain material limitations pursuant to
applicable laws, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis, within five Business Days from the Issue Date, by the Initial
Collateral, within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, by the Post Issue Date Collateral and, within 90 days from the
Completion Date, by the Post Completion Date Collateral. Within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial Guarantors. Within 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by the U.S. Guarantors. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain agreed security
principles and certain material limitations under applicable law, as described under “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. See also “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that_
_may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees_
_and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”,_
“Summary—The Offering—Security” and “Description of Notes—Security”. The Guarantors also guarantee or will guarantee,
as applicable, on a senior basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Collateral also secures or will secure,
as applicable, on a first-ranking basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if
any). Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, holders of the Notes will
receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain
super priority hedging obligations have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”. The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Description of
_Notes—Security” and “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and_

_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral”._
(5) On November 22, 2018, with a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Existing Notes, the Issuer made (i) the Flos I/C
Loan to Flos in an amount of €119.2 million in order to refinance certain previously existing indebtedness of Flos; (ii) the B&B
I/C Loan to B&B in amount of €87.5 in order to refinance certain previously existing indebtedness of B&B; and (iii) the Danish
HoldCo I/C Loan to Luminous Designs Investments ApS, which made a subsequent proceeds loan to Luminous Designs
Denmark ApS, both in an amount of €101.5, to refinance certain previously existing indebtedness of Luminous Designs
Denmark ApS. The subsequent proceeds loan by Luminous Designs Investments ApS to Luminous Designs Denmark ApS no
longer have any effect due to the completion of the Danish Merger completed on April 6, 2021. For further information on
the I/C Loans, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—I/C Loans”. A portion of the net proceeds from the
offering of the Notes, together with available cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, will be used by the Issuer to satisfy and
discharge and ultimately redeem the Existing Floating Rate Notes. In particular, for purposes of the Refinancing: (i)
€228.3 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to, among others, finance
the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo and to fund a portion of the Danish HoldCo I/C Loan to Danish
HoldCo, will be redeemed with proceeds from Tranche A under the Notes; (ii) €52.9 million of the Existing Floating Rate
Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the Flos I/C Loan to Flos, will be redeemed with
proceeds from Tranche B under the Notes; and (iii) €38.8 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which
were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the B&B I/C Loan to B&B, will be redeemed with the proceeds from Tranche C
under the Notes. For further information on Tranche A, Tranche B and Tranche C, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. For the avoidance of_
doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate portions of the proceeds of the Offering
being used to consummate the Acquisition and the various elements of the Refinancing, respectively, and will not entail
issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or common codes) for each such tranche.
(6) On or prior to the Completion Date, following the Escrow Release, we expect that the Issuer will use the net proceeds from
the Notes available under Tranche A (as defined under “Sources and Uses”) thereunder released from the Escrow Account
and certain available cash on balance sheet, in each case converted into USD, to transfer approximately USD180.4 million to
U.S. BidCo by way of (i) an equity contribution of approximately USD108.2 million and (ii) an intercompany loan for an
aggregate principal amount of approximately USD72.2 million (the “U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan”). For further information on
the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan”. See also “Use
_of Proceeds”._
(7) On the Completion Date, we expect that U.S. BidCo will acquire YDesign through the merger of U.S. MergerCo with and into
YDesign, with YDesign surviving the merger. As part of the Acquisition, we expect that, immediately prior to the Target
Merger, certain members of the current management team of YDesign will reinvest a portion of their respective proceeds
into U.S. BidCo (the “Target Management Reinvestment”), as a result of which, immediately following the consummation of
the Target Merger, the Issuer is expected to hold approximately 98% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of U.S.
BidCo and such of YDesign’s management team are expected to collectively hold approximately 2% of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of U.S. BidCo. As negotiations in respect of the Target Management Reinvestment are still
ongoing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we cannot exclude the possibility that YDesign management will
reinvest the relevant proceeds at the level of YDesign, as opposed to U.S. BidCo. In addition to the Target Management
Reinvestment, we expect to put in place customary compensation schemes as of or immediately following the Completion
Date, which in the future may result in the issuance of further equity interests of the relevant entity to YDesign management.
For further information, see “—The Transactions—The Acquisition”.
(8) On November 9, 2018, the Issuer, as borrower, entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which provides for the
€100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is or will be, as applicable, guaranteed on a senior basis
by the same entities that guarantee the Notes and is or will be, as applicable, secured on a first-priority basis over the same
collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging obligations (if any), subject to the applicable contractual and legal
limitations. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain material limitations under applicable law as described under
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations”. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the_
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations_
_on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_the Collateral”. “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”._
(9) On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, subject to certain agreed
security principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each of B&B, Flos, Louis Poulsen A/S and Antares
(collectively, the “Initial Guarantors”). Within 90 days following the Completion Date, subject to certain agreed security
principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by U.S. BidCo and YDesign (collectively, the “U.S. Guarantors”). As
of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding YDesign and U.S. BidCo) represented
65.6% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer, 75.2% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and 91.7% of the
consolidated total assets of the Issuer (as to assets, including the value of goodwill and trademark allocated to B&B, Flos and
Louis Poulsen in the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2020, the Guarantors (excluding YDesign and
U.S. BidCo) had €18.5 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party indebtedness, none of which was secured
and €15.0 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, and all of which is expected to remain in
place following the Transactions. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations.
See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations”. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less_
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_


20


-----

_Collateral”. The Notes Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and may be subject to release_
under certain circumstances. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ and
“Description of Notes—The Notes Guarantees”.
(10) Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer will not guarantee the Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not expected to guarantee the Notes had €32.9 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party indebtedness,
none of which was secured and €31.9 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, and all of which is
expected to remain in place following the Transactions. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the subsidiaries of
the Issuer which are not expected to guarantee the Notes represented 34.4% of the consolidated revenue of the Issuer,

22


-----

**Notes Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed.
Within 20 Business Days following the Issue Date, subject
to certain agreed security principles, the Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by Flos, B&B, Louis Poulsen
A/S and Antares (collectively, the “Initial Guarantors”).

Within 90 days following the Completion Date, subject to
certain agreed security principles, the Notes will also be
guaranteed on a senior basis by U.S. BidCo and YDesign
(collectively, the “U.S. Guarantors” and, together with
the Initial Guarantors and any subsidiary of the Issuer
that may guarantee the Notes from time to time
pursuant to the Indenture after the Issue Date, the
“Guarantors”, and the guarantees of the Notes provided
by the Guarantors, the “Notes Guarantees”).

Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain
significant contractual and legal limitations. See “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._ By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”._
The Notes Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and may be subject to release
under certain circumstances. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and_
“Description _of_ _Notes—The_ _Notes_ _Guarantees”._ The
Guarantors also guarantee or will guarantee, as
applicable, on a senior basis the Existing Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the
Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding YDesign and U.S.
BidCo) represented 65.6% of the consolidated revenue of
the Issuer, 75.2% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of
the Issuer and 91.7% of the consolidated total assets of
the Issuer (as to assets, including the value of goodwill
and trademark allocated to B&B, Flos and Louis Poulsen
in the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of
December 31, 2020, the Guarantors (excluding YDesign
and U.S. BidCo) had €18.5 million in aggregate principal
amount of external third-party indebtedness, none of
which was secured and €15.0 million of which was
represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, and all of
which is expected to remain in place following the
Transactions.

**Ranking of the Notes Guarantees . . .** The Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

                    - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor;

                   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and
future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

                   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing
and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such
Notes Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s
obligations under the Existing Notes, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging
obligations (if any);

                   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that
do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such indebtedness;
and

                    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes, including obligations to trade
creditors.

See also “Certain _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_
_and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_ _Considerations—Italy—_
_Limitation on validity and enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral—Certain_ _additional_
_considerations_ _in_ _relation_ _to_ _Notes_ _Guarantees_ _and_
_Collateral”._

**Security, Enforcement of Security . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by a firstranking security interest in the Escrow Account (the
“Escrow Charge”).

Within five Business Days following the Issue Date, the
Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests in:

                     - 100% of the share capital of the Issuer;

                    - certain material bank accounts of the Issuer; and

                    - the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the B&B I/C Loan,
the Flos I/C Loan and the Danish Holdco I/C Loan
(collectively, the “Initial Collateral”).

Within 20 Business Days following the Issue Date, the
Notes will be secured by first-ranking security interests in
100% of the share capital of each of Flos S.p.A., Antares
Iluminación S.A.U., B&B Italia S.p.A., Danish HoldCo and
Louis Poulsen A/S (collectively, the “Post Issue Date
**Collateral”)**

Within 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes
will also be secured by first-ranking security interests in:

                    - the equity interests of YDesign held by U.S. BidCo and
the equity interests of U.S. BidCo held by the Issuer;
and


24


-----

                   - the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the U.S. BidCo
Proceeds Loan (collectively, the “Post Completion Date
**Collateral” and, together with the Initial Collateral, the**
Post Issue Date Collateral and any other collateral
securing the Notes from time to time pursuant to the
Indenture, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral also secures or will secure, as applicable,
on a first-ranking basis the Existing Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations
(if any) and may also secure certain future indebtedness.
The Collateral will be granted subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, certain agreed security
principles and the terms of the security documents.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral only after the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to
certain super priority hedging obligations (if any) have
been repaid in full. See “Certain _Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by
applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may
limit their validity and enforceability and may be released
under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—
_Security”_ and “Certain _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral”._

**Escrow** **of** **Proceeds;** **Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial
Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the
Notes on the Issue Date, deposit €150.0 million of gross
proceeds from the offering of the Notes into the Escrow
Account. The Escrow Account will be in the name of the
Issuer, controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged in
favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds from the
Escrow Account (the “Escrow Release”) will be subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
completion of the Acquisition pursuant to the terms of
the Acquisition Agreement within two Business Days
following the Escrow Release. If the conditions to the
Escrow Release have not been satisfied on or prior to
November 20, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), the
Issuer will be required to redeem Notes with an
aggregate issue price equal to €150.0 million at a
redemption price equal to the issue price of such Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to
but excluding such special mandatory redemption date
and additional amounts, if any. The redeemed Notes shall


25


-----

be selected pro rata for redemption from all of the
Notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to_
_a number of conditions, which, if not fulfilled or if not_
_fulfilled in a timely manner, may result in termination of_
_the Acquisition Agreement”._

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes,
together with certain cash available on the Issuer’s
balance sheet, will be used to (i) satisfy and discharge
and ultimately redeem the Existing Floating Rate Notes,
(ii) within two Business Days following the Escrow
Release, finance the Acquisition and (iii) pay fees and
expenses in connection with the Transactions. See
“Summary—The Transactions”, “Description of Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and_
“Use of Proceeds”.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any
time on or after, 2022 at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption, as further
described under “Description _of_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption”._

At any time prior to, 2022, the Issuer may
redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a
“make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but
excluding) the date of redemption, as further described
under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption”.

**Optional** **redemption** **for** **taxation**
**reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If certain changes in the law (or in its interpretation) of
any relevant taxing jurisdiction impose certain
withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments
on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole,
but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but
not including) the date of redemption. See “Description
_of Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”._

**Additional amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Except as provided in “Description _of_ _Notes”,_ all
payments the Issuer makes with respect to the Notes, or
each Guarantor makes with respect to its Notes
Guarantee, will be made without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required
by law. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is
required to be made with respect to a payment on the
Notes or any Notes Guarantee, subject to certain
exceptions, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be,


26


-----

will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net
amount received by the holders of the Notes after the
withholding or deduction (including any withholding or
deduction in respect of the additional amounts) is not
less than the amount that they would have received in
the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Republic of
Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on
the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the
Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations.
Subject to and as set forth in “Description of Notes—
_Additional Amounts”, the Issuer will not be liable to pay_
any additional amounts to holders of the Notes if any
withholding or deduction is required pursuant to Decree
No. 239 or pursuant to Decree No. 461, except, in the
case of Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461, where the
procedures required under Decree No. 239 or Decree
No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not
been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions
of the Issuer or its agents. See “Description of Notes—
_Additional Amounts”._

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian
withholding tax will not be imposed under Decree
No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a holder of the Notes is
resident for tax purposes in a country which allows for a
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy (as
identified currently in Ministerial Decree of September 4,
1996 as subsequently amended and supplemented and,
in the future, in any decree to be issued under
Article 11(4)(c) of Decree No. 239; any such decree, the
“White List”) and such holder of the Notes complies with
certain certification requirements, there is no assurance
that this will be the case. Moreover, holders of the Notes
will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or in
Decree No. 461 after the date hereof, including any
change in the White List. See “Taxation—Certain Italian
_Tax Considerations”._

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to
purchase the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to
the date of purchase. However, a change of control will
not be deemed to have occurred if a specified net
consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection
with such event. See “Description of Notes”.

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the
ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;


27


-----

                   - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                    - make certain other restricted payments;

                     - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                 - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                      - transfer or sell certain assets;

                    - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                     - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                    - impair the security interests created for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes
obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to
significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description
_of Notes—Certain Covenants”._

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and
will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are
subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See
“Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors” and “Notice to
_Certain European Investors”. We have not agreed to, or_
otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes under the
securities laws in any jurisdiction (including by way of an
exchange offer).

**No Established Market for the**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no established trading market. Although the
Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do
so and they may discontinue market making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an
active trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application has been made to admit the Notes to listing
on the Official List of the LuxSE and to trading on the
Euro MTF Market, in accordance with the rules thereof.
There is no assurance that the Notes will be, or will
remain, listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market.

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event
that the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. investors in the
Notes generally will be required to include the OID in
gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it
accrues using the constant yield method, in advance of
the receipt of cash corresponding to such income,
regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. For more information, see
“Taxation—Certain United States Federal Income Tax
_Considerations”._


28


-----

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will
be governed by the laws of the State of New York. The
Intercreditor Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement are governed by English law. The security
documents will be governed by the applicable law of the
jurisdiction under which the security interests are
granted.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c.

**Security Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** UniCredit S.p.A.

**Escrow Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

**Paying Agent and Calculation**
**Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

**Registrar and Transfer Agent . . . . . . .** The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch.

Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider carefully all the information
in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set
forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum before making a decision
whether to invest in the Notes.

(1) “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) for the period excluding the effect of income taxes, net financial expenses
(income) and amortization and depreciation, on the basis of our consolidated profit and loss statement presented in
accordance with IFRS, as derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, as adjusted for certain non-core and
non-recurring items occurred in the relevant period, further adjusted to remove the impact of IFRS 16 and the associated
interest expense.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the performance of the Issuer that is not required by, or presented in
accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is not a measurement of the
financial performance of the Issuer under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income,
cash flows or any other measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash
flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful
information with respect to the overall operating performance and debt service capacity of the Issuer by facilitating
comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from the
Group’s core operations. We believe Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties to assist in their assessment of the trading performance of the business of the Issuer. We note, however, that Adjusted
EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered a substitute measure to net income, net income
margin, as an indicator of operating performance, as an alternative to operating cash flows or as a measure of our liquidity.

(€27.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and €23.7 million as of December 31, 2020) and excluding accrued but unpaid
interest (€5.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and €5.6 million as of December 31, 2020).

(4) “Synergized EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted for certain cost and revenue synergies we expect to
realize, as further described below.

“Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA” is defined as Synergized EBITDA, as further adjusted for (i) the Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign
for the year ended December 31, 2020, (ii) certain synergies that we expect to realize from the combination of the Group and
YDesign and (iii) adjustment for COVID-19 effects, as further described below.

The Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign is presented in this Offering Memorandum for illustrative purposes because, when added to
our Synergized EBITDA to calculate our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, we believe it provides a useful measure of the
combined results of operations of the Issuer and YDesign as if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020. However, the
Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign is unaudited, has not been otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts, and
has been derived from YDesign financial statements and management accounts, which are prepared on the basis of U.S.
GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign is therefore not comparable with the Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer presented herein,
which is derived from underlying financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. See also “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information—Certain Consolidated Financial Information of YDesign”._

Moreover, the adjustments used to calculate Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA are based on a number of
assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us, a third-party report commissioned by us, and management’s
judgments based on such information. The available information is preliminary and the assumptions used in estimating the
components underlying Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA are inherently uncertain, forward looking in
nature and subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties. We cannot
assure you that the information on which we have based our assumptions will not change or that we will be able to realize
any of the as-yet unrealized cost savings and revenue synergies we believe are possible based on these management
estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings and revenue synergies may
be substantially higher than our current estimates and could outweigh any benefit. Accordingly, this information does not
represent the results such cost saving initiatives or revenue synergies would have achieved had the initiatives been
implemented or revenue streams been in place as of January 1, 2020.

Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful measure
of the combined results of operations the Group and YDesign. However, Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA does not purport to
indicate our future consolidated results of operations following the Acquisition. Our actual results may differ significantly
from those reflected in our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences
in the accounting standards applied for the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Group (IFRS) and the Adjusted EBITDA
of YDesign (U.S. GAAP) and our ability to realize the expected synergies from the Acquisition and other synergies.

Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have audited, reviewed, verified, compiled,
examined or performed any procedures with respect to our Synergized EBITDA or Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, nor have
they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. Synergized EBITDA and
Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA do not constitute measures of financial performance under IFRS or any other auditing
standard, and you should not consider Synergized EBITDA or Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA as an alternative to net income or
any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or any other auditing standard or as a measure of our results
of operations or liquidity.

See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Financial Information—Our Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum_
_are based upon management estimates and assumptions in respect of certain cost savings and revenue synergies. Such_
_estimates and assumptions might prove to be materially incorrect as a result of factors that are beyond our control and are_

(a) New D-Studio stores openings reflects the estimated incremental annual run-rate EBITDA we expect to generate in 2022
from two stores that we plan to open during 2021 in the format of “D-Studio”. In particular, this adjustment includes: (i)
€1.0 million of incremental annual EBITDA expected to be generated in 2022 by the “Milano Durini” store (which
currently exists as a B&B-only store and will be remodeled and reopened in 2021) and (ii) €1.2 million of incremental
EBITDA expected to be generated in 2022 by our Scandi store in Copenhagen (which we will open in 2021). We expect to
incur capital expenditures of approximately €4.8 million and other one-off costs of approximately €1.3 million for the
opening of such stores, which are not reflected in this adjustment and which we have included in our budget in 2021.
(b) Launch of direct e-commerce reflects the estimated incremental annual run-rate EBITDA we expect to generate in 2022
from sales of our products on the centralized e-commerce platform that we plan to launch in 2021 and that we expect
will serve as a platform where products from all our brands (except for Arclinea) will be sold. We expect to incur capital
expenditures of approximately €1.9 million for the launch of such common e-commerce platform, which are not
reflected in this adjustment and which we have included in our budget in 2021.
(c) Cost synergies reflects the estimated annual run-rate cost synergies we expect to realize from initiatives that we have
already started implementing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. In particular, the adjustment includes: (i)
€0.6 million of expected annual run-rate cost savings from the transfer of the architectural production from LP to Flos
which we expect to fully complete in the second half of 2022. We expect to realize the full amount of these cost savings
in 2023; (ii) €0.6 million of estimated cost savings we expect to realize in 2021 in relation to investments we made at the
Arclinea plant which we expect to result in a more efficient production process with reduced labor, supply and energy
costs and (iii) €0.2 million of expected administrative and other cost savings from the rationalization of Flos’ corporate
structure through the merger of three subsidiaries of Flos (Euroformat S.r.l., Flos Milano S.r.l. and Flos Roma S.r.l.) into
Flos, which we completed during the course of 2020.
(d) YDesign Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 is derived from YDesign’s financial statements, which
are not presented herein, and has been converted from U.S. dollars into euro by applying an exchange rate equal to 0.88
$/€, corresponding to the average exchange rate for the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.

YDesign’s financial statements are prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP. Therefore, YDesign Adjusted EBITDA presented
herein is not comparable to our Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated on the basis of our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—
_Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Information—The consolidated financial_
_information of YDesign presented herein, including as part of our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, was prepared on the_
_basis of U.S. GAAP and is therefore not comparable with the consolidated financial information of the Issuer, which was_
_prepared on the basis of IFRS”._
(e) Synergies from the Acquisition includes estimated annual run-rate revenue synergies that we expect to achieve in full in
2022 from the integration of YDesign within the Group, mainly deriving from (i) sales on the YDesign platform of B&B
products which are currently not sold by YDesign (approximately $0.4 million) and (ii) the support of the Group in respect
of sales of YDesign private label products which YDesign is currently in the process of setting up (approximately $3.3
million). These U.S. dollar amounts were converted in euro by using an exchange rate equal to 0.85 $/€, corresponding to
the spot exchange rate as at March 25, 2021, resulting in approximately €3.2 million of total synergies. This adjustment
already reflects minor costs we expect to incur in 2021 and 2022 to achieve such synergies, mainly related to targeted
marketing initiatives and increased labor costs to develop YDesign private label products.
(f) Adjustment for COVID-19 effects includes costs we incurred during the lockdown periods in various locations where we
operate in relation to corporate departments and services that were inactive or not effective due to the restrictions, such
as warehouses and stores. In particular, the adjustment consists of: (i) €1.2 million of supply chain costs in Italy mainly
related to storage costs, rent, payroll and other overhead expenses, (ii) €0.3 million of supply chain costs in the United
States, (iii) €1.4 million of idle costs incurred by directly operated stores for rent, storage, payroll and fix utilities
regardless of the store shutdowns imposed by the relevant governments, and (iv) €0.3 million of non-refundable costs
related to cancellation fees paid for fairs that were cancelled as a consequence of the pandemic.

(5) “Pro Forma Cash and Short-term Deposits” represents our cash and short-term deposits as of December 31, 2020 as adjusted
for the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2020. It does not reflect €17.7 million of interest
payments in respect of the Existing Notes which will fall due on May 15, 2021 or the amount of cash generated and not
utilized by the Group between December 31, 2020 and the Completion Date, as further described in footnote (1) under
“Capitalization”. See also “Use of Proceeds”.
(6) “Pro Forma Adjusted Net Financial Debt” is defined as Adjusted Net Financial Debt as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the
Transactions as if they had occurred on December 31, 2020. For further information, see “Capitalization”.
(7) “Pro Forma Cash Interest Expense” is defined as the cash interest expense of the Issuer for the year ended December 31,
2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2020. This estimate reflects the
issuance of €470.0 million Floating Rate Notes issued at % and carrying an interest rate of three-month EURIBOR plus %
(assuming the three-month EURIBOR rate as of the date hereof was in effect for the entire period), the redemption of the
Existing Floating Rate Notes and the cash interest payments made by the Issuer on its other financial indebtedness (including
the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility) during the course of 2020. Pro Forma Cash Interest Expense
does not include interest accrued on the €46.9 million IFRS 16 lease liabilities outstanding on December 31, 2020 that we
expect will remain in place after the Refinancing, as further described under “Capitalization”), and is calculated gross of any
debt issuance costs in connection with the offering of the Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes.

##### Other Financial Information
The tables below present our revenue breakdowns by brands, sales channel and geographical
area for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. The revenue breakdown by brands
presented below reflect our accounting segments under IFRS 8, whereas the revenue breakdowns
by sales channel and geographical area presented below are based on our management
accounts, which marginally differ from our statutory accounts. Therefore, the total revenue
figures shown in the tables below will differ depending on whether the relevant figures are
derived from our statutory accounts or from our management accounts. For additional
information, see “Presentation _of_ _Financial_ _and_ _Other_ _Information—Historical_ _Financial_
_Information—Revenue_ _Breakdowns”._ The revenue breakdowns are being presented for
information purposes because we believe that they provide a useful measure of our results of
operations. However, the revenue breakdowns by sales channel and geographical area have not
been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. In
addition, revenue breakdowns do not necessarily reflect the divisions or channels on which the
Group will report going forward. Accordingly, any reliance you place on this information should
take this into consideration.

## RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prospective investors should consider_
_carefully the risks described below and the other information contained in this Offering_
_Memorandum prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Notes. Each of the_
_risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_
_results of operations or prospects which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the_
_principal amount and interest which investors will receive in respect of the Notes. In addition,_
_each of the risks discussed below could adversely affect the trading or the trading price of the_
_Notes or the rights of investors under the Notes and, as a result, investors could lose some or all_
_of their investment. Prospective investors should note that the risks described below may not be_
_the only risks we face. We have described only those risks that we currently consider to be_
_material and there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that_
_we currently consider immaterial, that might also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward_
_looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-looking statements”._

##### Risks Related to Our Business

**_The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or_**
**_outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact._**

In late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the
World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities
around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures,
along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of
lockdowns and other restrictive orders, have led to an economic downturn in our markets and
have had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operate. In
particular, several of the governments of the countries in which we operate imposed significant
lockdown measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19; on March 9, 2020, for example,
the Italian government imposed a nationwide lockdown together with several other measures to
contain the pandemic and in doing so, imposed the temporary closure of all of our
manufacturing facilities and the stores in which our products are sold. Similar measures were
adopted by the governments of several other countries in which we operate. Although the
nationwide lockdowns were gradually lifted (e.g., on May 4, 2020 in Italy), significant restrictions
and social distancing measures were imposed. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we
incurred €1.7 million of costs related to COVID-19, such as cost for enhanced safety measures in
our plants, stores and offices, increased shipping costs, and non-reimbursable costs that we
incurred for setting up fairs that were cancelled. During the lockdown periods, we also incurred
additional €3.1 million of costs in various locations where we operate in relation to corporate
departments and services that were inactive or not effective due to the restrictions, such as
warehouses and stores. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other
_Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Data”. In addition, in the fall of 2020, Italy was affected by_
a resurgence of rising COVID-19 case levels, resulting in a regional lockdowns. Other
international European markets in which we operate, as well as countries from which we source
our products, have also been affected by lockdowns and similar measures.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum several restrictive measures remain in place, which
continue to adversely affect the overall global economy and, in turn, our operations and our
customers and business partners’ operations. For example, an evening curfew was set in Italy
during the fall of 2020 and due to restrictions imposed on large gatherings, many of the stores
where our products are sold have suffered either closures or restricted opening and closing times

38


-----

as well as restrictions on the amounts of customers allowed inside the respective venues. In
addition, new strains of the virus have been discovered in late 2020 and 2021, which are
characterized by higher transmission rates and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a
new wave of COVID-19 is still spreading across many countries in Europe, notwithstanding the
progressive rollout of vaccination programs in many countries. There can be no assurance that
measures currently in place and/or the existing vaccines will be successful in combatting any new
strains of the virus. Moreover, as the vaccination programs are progressing slowly in certain
areas, there can be no assurance as to if and when the population of the countries in which we
operate will be fully immunized.

We cannot predict if, when or where further waves of COVID-19 will occur, how far into the
future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any level of certainty the
impacts of any such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local
lockdowns or other measures implemented by the governments and/or local or regional
authorities of the countries in which we operate. There may be a decrease in demand for our
products in the event of further resurgences of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other pandemics,
public health emergencies or threats, any of which may necessitate regulatory responses,
resulting in temporary store closures, modified store operating hours, a decrease in customer
traffic, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, cancellation of events or
disruptions to our supply chain, among other effects, any of which may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Moreover, even when the stores where our products are sold are allowed to remain open, social
distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further spread of COVID-19 may impact
the operation and appeal of our stores. Customers unaccustomed to wearing face coverings or
observing social distancing guidance may choose to shop online or not shop at all. In addition,
the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to loss of market share to our competitors who may have more
developed online sales capabilities.

We have been, and may in the future be, required to temporarily close certain of our stores,
offices or other facilities for cleaning or to take other responsive or precautionary measures. For
example, we experienced temporary shutdown of our manufacturing facilities in Italy and in the
United States; moreover we re-organized working hours in all of our plants in order to maintain
social distancing and all our offices adopted massively home working as a precautionary measure.
Similarly, our directly operated stores restricted access to customers and allowed access by
appointment. Likewise, planned renovation and maintenance, as well as the opening of new
stores, have been and may continue to be delayed, suspended or terminated in order to protect
our liquidity and cash position and due to COVID-19-related restrictions, such as requiring that
workers only leave their homes for essential purposes. Where appropriate and possible, we have
transitioned our employees to a remote work environment, which may exacerbate our
vulnerability to certain risks, including, for example, cybersecurity attacks and phishing emails,
which we believe is an increased risk to our business in a remote work environment. We may be
subject to potential litigation as a result of customers or employees who claim they have
contracted COVID-19 at our stores or other facilities, which may cause us to incur significant costs
and which may have a negative impact on our brand and reputation. We may also be subject to
potential litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working
environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. All of these risks may be further
exacerbated by resurgences of the virus. Although the governments in Italy, Spain, Denmark and
the U.S. have increasingly employed sophisticated strategies for combatting the virus in an effort
to avoid costly and extensive lockdown measures, the magnitude of possible virus resurgences
and the resulting impacts on the economy may materially negatively impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by customers and other factors as
described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused,
and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity globally, which has and is
expected to continue to lead to a decline in discretionary spending. Our revenues have been and

39


-----

may in the future be negatively impacted by adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic
climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels, increases in taxation
and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive
measures implemented to respond to it. Other factors that have negatively impacted and may
continue to negatively impact our ability to successfully operate during the current COVID-19
pandemic include: our ability to react to changes in anticipated customer demand and manage
inventories, which may result in either insufficient or excess inventories, our ability to rely on our
distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of our
products due to local and regional factors, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing
of goods produced in infected areas and a retail environment that causes us to make a greater
use of discounts.

The outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of COVID-19 remains subject to
unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged in many of the markets in
which we operate. Furthermore, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19
pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to predict, the
pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption to the global
financial markets, which may in turn reduce our ability to access to capital or our customers’
ability to pay us for past or future services, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In
addition, an economic recession or further financial market corrections resulting from the
ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic makes any prediction on the final effects of the
pandemic highly uncertain and subject to change.

A renewed or future financial recession could lead to an adverse impact on demand for our
products and on our results of operations. In addition, political repercussions of responses to the
COVID-19 outbreak by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European
Union and worldwide could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future,
including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of
European integration, already impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the European
Union effective January 1, 2021. It is unclear whether measures taken by European Union
institutions, the Italian government and other governments of the countries in which we operate
to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and effective to achieve containment. The
extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic may impact our business will depend on future
developments, including the availability, distribution and effectiveness of any COVID 19 vaccine
and the progress in the rollout of vaccination programs in the countries where we operate, which
are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot guarantee that COVID-19 or any future
outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

In addition to the factors listed above, COVID-19 and the measures taken globally to respond to
it have created an environment of uncertainty and rapid, unpredictable changes that exacerbate
and magnify certain of the other risks we face. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
business and our industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the length of time it takes for demand and
pricing to return to pre-pandemic levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to
resume, and the potential for virus resurgence across the markets and countries in which we
operate. There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot
currently estimate this with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will
not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also have the effect of
heightening any or all of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, including those

_Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of_
_the Group—COVID-19”._

**_We are affected by general economic conditions worldwide, and unfavorable economic_**
**_conditions could result in a decline in the demand for our products and a material adverse effect_**
**_on our financial performance._**
Our revenue, profitability, cash flow and future growth are affected by general economic
conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns. The foregoing may also be adversely
affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends,
whether actual or perceived, or developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic that reduce
consumers’ ability or willingness to spend. In particular, our business is heavily dependent on the
demand for high-end furniture and lighting products, especially in Europe, North America and
the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, which make up a significant portion of the Group’s revenue.
Declining economic conditions in any of the locations in which we operate, economic stagnation
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or negative perceptions about economic conditions, could
lead to a decrease in consumer spending and ultimately a decline in the demand for our
products, which in turn would adversely affect our business. In particular, our products are
discretionary items and sales of such items normally depend on positive consumer sentiment and
the availability of discretionary income. For example, according to the Industry Report, the
immediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the high-end furniture and lighting
design market decreasing in size from approximately €38 billion in 2019 to approximately €35 to
36 billion in 2020.

From 2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic started, the global economy was growing at a modest
pace, curbed by the stagnation of economic activity in parts of Europe, as well as the slow-down
of several emerging economies. Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been the primary
factor in increased global uncertainty from an economic and social perspective, which has
resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial
markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Measures that governments have already
adopted, or plan to adopt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue
to have, an adverse effect on supply chain resulting, for instance, in plant closures or increases in
the cost of raw materials, and generally impact business operations across the economy both as a
result of weakened economic activity and the employees being affected. See “—The COVID-19
_pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business,_
_financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of_
_infectious diseases may have a similar impact”. Furthermore, global economic conditions have_
been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions
as well as political developments affecting several countries, including the continued political
uncertainty in Italy, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union effective
January 1, 2021, the possible exit from the European Union of more Member States and/or the
replacement of the euro by one or more successor currencies to which the foregoing could lead.
See “—Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential reintroduction of
_individual currencies within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could_
_negatively impact our business or our ability to refinance our liabilities. In addition, the current_
_political uncertainty in Italy could affect our business”). These events could have a detrimental_
impact on the global economic recovery and the repayment of sovereign and non-sovereign debt
in certain countries, as well as on the financial condition of European institutions, further
increasing the volatility in the European financial markets, which may affect demand for the
Group’s products.

Although the U.S. and Canadian economies appear to be slowly recovering from the negative
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by the emergency economic stimulus passed under
the respective administrations of such countries (including the package passed under the Biden
administration in March 2021) and by the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, there can be
no assurance that such recovery will continue, or that the U.S. and Canadian economies will not,
in the near future, experience economic challenges including due to a recrudescence of the
ongoing pandemic or, in particular, that the U.S. will not engage in protectionism or trade wars

41


-----

with other countries that could adversely impact global economic conditions. Furthermore, the
weakening of currencies in some emerging countries from time to time increases the risk of
financial contagion in emerging markets globally. Any extended recession or other periods of
declining economic conditions, either globally or in any of the locations in which we operate,
could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

It is difficult to predict how economic conditions will develop, as they are affected by macro
movements of the financial markets and other factors, including the measures taken by
governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks. Uncertainty remains in the global
markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which
could be more prolonged or have greater financial impact than past global recessions. Continued
weakness in the global economy for a significant period of time, or a further deterioration of
global economic conditions, could adversely affect consumer-spending behavior, which is driven
by levels of unemployment, inflation or deflation, disposable income, interest rates, the
availability of consumer credit and consumer perception of their own economic prospects and
overall economic conditions. Although to different degrees, these factors affect all markets in
which we operate. Our revenue and profitability could therefore be adversely affected by
unfavorable economic conditions, economic downturns or an otherwise uncertain economic
outlook, globally or in one or more of the principal markets in which we operate or will operate
in the future. Deteriorating economic conditions by limiting demand for our products, may also
increase pricing pressure on the products that we sell and result in a corresponding decline in our
margins.

Moreover, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining
financing or credit on favorable terms in order to fulfill our financing needs (including the need
to refinance or repay our debt obligations, including the Notes). If we are unable to repay our
debt obligations or access the credit and capital markets, we may not be able to pursue certain of
our business plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. Global economic conditions and uncertainties
may also affect our suppliers, resulting in, for example, supplier plant closures or increases in the
cost of merchandise and/or raw materials. As a result, an economic downturn or persistent
unfavorable economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, particularly conditions that
negatively affect consumer spending, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has
_adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition,_
_results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may_
_have a similar impact”._

**_If we are unable to successfully introduce new products, develop our brands and adapt to_**
**_changing customer preferences, our business may suffer._**

The high-end furniture and lighting industries are subject to rapidly changing consumer
preferences and trends. The purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be
influenced by many factors, such as marketing programs, product design and brand image.
Consumers of our products tend to be design conscious, have rigorous standards and
sophisticated tastes, which can be difficult to satisfy or anticipate. The historical success of our
brands is attributable, in part, to our ability to introduce products which are perceived to
anticipate, shape and reflect interior design trends. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we
incurred €10.0 of capital expenditures on research and product development to support our
ability to continue to produce innovative and beautifully designed products that meet our
customers’ needs and expectations, which we believe is critical to our future success. We estimate
that we generated 36.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the sale of
products which each of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen introduced during the last five years. Our
success also depends on our ability to react to changing customer and consumer demands,
preferences and habits in a timely manner. We cannot predict whether the new products we
launch will be well received by consumers in our target markets and/or demographics, or even

42


-----

whether such new products will be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner. Decisions
regarding product design must be made months in advance of the time when consumer
acceptance can be measured and, therefore, such decisions are inherently uncertain. An inability
to keep pace with product development, anticipate consumer preferences, meet consumer
demands or understand consumer habits could have a negative impact on our inventory and
result in material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

Our business is also subject to frequent and sometimes significant changes in technology, and if
we fail to anticipate or adequately respond to such changes, or do not have sufficient capital to
invest or respond to these developments, our profits may decline. Our future financial
performance will depend in part upon our ability to adapt our products to evolving technology
successfully, both to keep up with customer expectations and preferences and to improve our
business operations. We cannot predict all the effects of future technological changes. The cost
of adapting our products to new technologies could be significant, and our ability to finance
these costs may be adversely affected by poor market conditions resulting in lower revenues and
cash generation, our debt servicing requirements or our inability to obtain the financing we
require. There can be no assurance that the investments we have made in product development
and technology will generate expected returns by enabling us to increase or maintain market
share. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with our investment
and business plans. Any inability to successfully adapt to changing customer preferences and
technologies, make sufficient investments in research, technology renovation and product
development or generate expected returns on those investments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We face significant competition in the development, production and sale of our products._**

The market for high-end designer furniture and lighting is highly competitive. The key factors
that affect competition in this market include the profiles of designers and the designs
themselves, the technical know-how of internal research and product development teams, the
breadth of distribution networks and the ability to interact with existing and new customers.
Also important is a strong design heritage and the quality of relationships with designers and
specifiers. Our competitors may focus more of their resources than we do on competitive
activities, such as sales and marketing, research and product development and strategic
acquisitions, or may have greater purchasing economies of scale and lower cost bases including as
a result of business combinations (such as the acquisition of Knoll by Herman Miller, which is
expected to close this year).

Over the past several years, certain large international retailers such as IKEA and Maisons du
Monde, historically focused on lower range furnishing and lighting solutions characterized by a
low or absent design component, have expanded their product offerings to enter the
“affordable inspirational” segment of the furniture and lighting market. This is an attempt to
enlarge their customer base through the offering of quality products with appealing design and
at lower price points compared to the high-end furnishing and lighting segment in which we
operate. Should these retailers continue to improve the design and quality of their products and
maintain accessible price points, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers
if we are not able to continue to materially differentiate our products and brands in terms of
quality and design. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, although our custom and
contract operations are currently less impacted by this competition, these retailers could expand
their operations to such segments in the future. In particular, there are companies (such as Bemz,
Semihandmade, Pretty Pegs) dedicated solely to taking minimal IKEA furniture and turning it
into unique pieces that suits one’s style and aesthetic.

Moreover, our license agreements with designers typically do not grant us the rights to future
designs of the licensors. When bidding for these licenses, or for licenses with new designers, our
competitors may be able to offer more favorable payment terms or new license arrangements

43


-----

that strengthen their competitive position or prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities
to work with certain designers, or we may be required as a result of competitive pressure to
agree to less favorable terms than we have achieved historically in order to maintain our
relationships or build new relationships with designers.

Competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or
changing opportunities, technologies, standards or consumer preferences. Competitors may also
possess broader distribution networks, have more extensive e-commerce operations, more
actively sell through social media or have larger networks of directly-operated stores, which
could allow them to exercise more control over their brand than we can. In particular, barriers to
entry for e-commerce or social networks are low, and current and new competitors can launch
new e-commerce platforms or sell their products through social media at a relatively low cost
while also reaching large numbers of potential customers by using the internet for marketing. As
a result of competition through e-commerce channels, we may experience pricing pressure and
loss of market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased
competition could limit our ability to increase our prices or require us to reduce prices or increase
our spending on marketing, sales and research and product development, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Our failure to effectively control our distribution network and their commercial practices could_**
**_adversely affect our brand reputation. In addition, any disruption in the operations of our_**
**_distributors or in our relationships with them could adversely affect our business._**

We generate a large portion of our revenue through wholesale retailers that we do not own and
that we may approach either directly (including through our subsidiaries, where possible) or
through third-party agents and distributors, depending on the features and practices of each
relevant market. We normally have little control over the commercial practices of wholesale
retailers, some of whom operate partially or exclusively as online retailers, or over third-party
agents and distributors. In particular, it is difficult for us to monitor the price levels and
commercial practices applied by wholesale retailers, third-party agents and distributors, especially
through the internet, where our products could be subject to multiple interim sales before
reaching the end customers. In most cases, wholesale retailers are not contractually bound to
apply minimum price levels and could therefore apply discounts inconsistently in the same
market or in different markets, which could be perceived negatively by our customers. In
addition, if our wholesale retailers were to apply unfair commercial practices to the detriment of
the end customers or offer material discounts on our products, our brand reputation could be
harmed and sales in our retail channel could also suffer.

Each of our brands relies to a certain extent on third-party distributors and agents for the sale of
their products, and our success depends in part on the quality of services provided by, and our
relationships with, these third-party distributors and agents. We normally employ distributors
and agents in countries or areas where we do not have a subsidiary or that we cannot otherwise
reach directly with our sales team. Our relationships with these distributors and agents are a
significant factor in our success and growth strategy. Even though we strive to monitor the
operations and performance of our third-party distributors and agents and their compliance with
applicable laws and with the contractual arrangements that govern our relationships with them,
we do not own or control our third-party distributors and agents, and they own, operate and
oversee their daily operations. Our third-party distributors and agents may not commit the
necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, and may not
operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, best practices, standards or
regulations. In addition, our distributors may face operational disruptions or financial distress,
which could cause them to suspend or shut down their operations or terminate their
relationships with us. For example, a distributor that operated three of B&B’s points of sale in
Texas shut down its operations in 2018 due to a business decision of its shareholders unrelated to
B&B, which resulted in B&B having to replace the distributor in connection with two of the
affected points of sale and to assume the direct management of the other affected point of sale.

44


-----

In addition, as a result of the measures adopted by the various governments to stop the spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our third-party distributors had to temporarily suspend their
business and some of them have not yet reopened. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely
_affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a_
_similar impact”. The inability of our third-party distributors or agents to maintain the perception_
of prestige and high quality associated with our products could have an adverse impact on our
brands, adversely affect our ability to compete or expose us to legal claims from designers if we
fail to market or sell products in accordance with the terms of our license agreements. Any
disruptions in our third-party distributors’ or agents’ financial or operational conditions and any
adverse changes in the relationships with our third-party distributors and agents could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Our business is in part dependent on our ability to negotiate, maintain and renew license_**
**_agreements with leading designers on satisfactory terms._**
The success of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B is based on a unique combination of creativity,
innovation and industrial capabilities. We believe that the close cooperation between our
in-house research and product development and design teams and our long standing
relationships with internationally renowned designers have significantly contributed to the
success of each of our brands in the global design industry. Our business depends in part on our
ability to maintain good relationships on satisfactory terms with leading designers. We have
entered into numerous intellectual property right assignment agreements as well as exclusive or
non-exclusive license agreements with our designers that enable us, pursuant to each
agreement’s contractual framework, to commercially exploit (and, in certain cases, to register in
our own name) the intellectual property created by these designers that makes up part of our
furniture and lighting collections. However, certain of our assignment agreements do not
explicitly transfer the underlying intellectual property rights to us or expressly grant us the right
to file or register patents, designs and other intellectual property rights with respect to the
assigned product shapes. Therefore, under these agreements the designer could be entitled to
challenge the validity of any registration of intellectual property rights by us as well as claiming a
violation of his or her rights. Moreover, under many of the assignment agreements the product
shapes are assigned to us against the payment of royalties to the designer for the entire duration
of the open-ended agreement, which could result in the early termination of the agreement by
the designer should we not pay royalties in a timely manner. In such case, the assigned
intellectual property rights could revert back to the designer. In addition, some of our employee
inventors, employees and/or consultants who are or were involved in product development
activities not governed by their employment contracts or other agreements have not received
specific consideration for the inventive activity carried out in relation to certain patents that have
been filed and granted on our behalf, which could result in claims by the employee inventors,
employees and/or consultants to receive such specific consideration or to claim the moral rights
on the inventions.

With respect to our license agreements, we believe that our ability to negotiate, maintain and
renew such agreements on satisfactory terms, particularly those that contribute to the ethos that
is central to our brands, is essential to maintaining a successful product portfolio. Certain of the
license agreements for Flos and, except for a small number of license agreements with key
designers, most of the license agreements for B&B are for open-ended terms with provisions
allowing the relevant designer to terminate the agreement at any time with prior written notice.
Louis Poulsen primarily benefits from license agreements with its core five designer designers–
Poul Henningsen, Arne Jacobsen, Verner Panton, Vilhelm Lauritzen and Christian Flindt, which
generated 65.2% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Pursuant to
these agreements, Louis Poulsen has been granted the exclusive right to commercially exploit the
intellectual property associated with a portfolio of each designer’s lighting designs, with the
rights generally granted for the duration of the validity of the copyright of the design, which
extends for 70 years after the death of the designer. The first of such licenses to expire will do so
in December 2037. After the relevant expiry date, Louis Poulsen will still be able to produce and

45


-----

sell the designs of such designers, but without exclusivity. To complement its heritage collection,
Louis Poulsen relies to a lesser extent on license agreements with other designers that feature
different terms. In particular, although these license agreements do not have set termination
dates, certain of these agreements grant the designers the right to terminate the agreement
should certain minimum sales rates fail to be met over a specified period, or should Louis Poulsen
significantly reduce or cease production of certain products. For more information, see “—The
_loss of certain key license agreements could result in the loss of revenue and materially and_
_adversely affect our business. In addition, certain of our designers are not subject to_
_non-compete obligations during the term of their license agreements with us and/or following_
_the termination thereof, and our business could be adversely affected if they were to successfully_
_cooperate with our competitors”._

Failure to maintain or renew license agreements on the same or better terms, or failure to secure
comparable replacements or negotiate new license agreements or assignment agreements with
other leading designers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

**_The loss of certain key license agreements could result in the loss of revenue and materially and_**
**_adversely affect our business. In addition, certain of our designers are not subject to_**
**_non-compete obligations during the term of their license agreements with us and/or following_**
**_the termination thereof, and our business could be adversely affected if they were to_**
**_successfully cooperate with our competitors._**

Our business depends in part on maintaining license agreements with key designers and
cultivating the continued appeal of our licensed designs through consistent innovation. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, the top five designers in terms of revenue for each brand who
have license agreements with us generated 32.2% of Flos’ total revenue, 65.2% of Louis Poulsen’s
revenue and 72.8% of B&B’s total revenue, respectively. Although we have historically
maintained positive relationships with our designers and have been able to maintain and renew
key licenses, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. See “Business—
_Flos—Agreements with Designers”, “Business—Louis Poulsen—Agreements with Designers” and_
“Business—B&B Italia—Agreements with Designers”. The term of our licenses typically varies in
length, with B&B licenses having either open-ended terms or, for certain key licenses, specified
terms of 20 years. Flos licenses generally have open-ended terms that can be terminated by the
designer at any time with notice and Louis Poulsen licenses typically feature open-ended terms
that extend for the life of the copyright and contain different renewal conditions, termination
clauses, license fees and royalty obligations.

Certain of our license agreements cannot be terminated by the licensor based on performance
related criteria, although the licensor may elect not to renew the license at expiry if we do not
meet their performance expectations. Some of our other license agreements contain broad
termination provisions in favor of the designers, allowing the designers to terminate the license
in certain circumstances, including the failure to start production, breach of obligation to obtain
approval from the designer in connection with, for example, certain changes to their designs or
default on royalty and other payments, among other provisions. Moreover, certain of our license
agreements do not have an expiry date, which means that the relevant designer may decide to
terminate their agreement at any time, with prior written notice.

In addition, some of our license agreements lack non-compete clauses, meaning that, following
termination, a designer would be permitted to license to third parties the intellectual property
rights previously covered by the license agreement. Moreover, designers are normally free to
cooperate with other companies operating in our industry on the design of products that are not
covered by the license agreement which could be in competition with ours. See also “—We face
_significant competition in the development, production and sale of our products”. If a key_
designer decides to terminate a material license or otherwise requires us to cease production of a
key design, or if he or she were to cooperate with our competitors in the creation of successful
designs in competition with our products, the impact on our market position, our brands and our

46


-----

revenue may be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Consumer spending on high-end design products could be displaced by spending on other_**
**_activities as driven by a number of factors._**
Consumer spending on high-end design products could decrease or be displaced by spending on
other activities as driven by a number of factors including:

- general economic conditions and other factors that affect consumer discretionary spending;

- reduced purchasing power as a result of the economic effects caused by the COVID-19
pandemic;

- housing market conditions, as consumers are generally more likely to purchase new lighting
and furniture when they purchase a home;

- shifts in behavior away from home decorating in favor of other products or activities, such as
travel, entertainment or electronics;

- natural and other disasters, including pandemics, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts,
heavy snow, ice or rain storms, which disrupt the ability of consumers to continue spending on
high-end design products;

- man-made disasters, such as terrorism or war, as well as other national and international
security concerns; and

- other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.

Total consumer spending may not rebound from the slowdown caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. Even if it rebounds, it may not regain its historical rates in the short to medium term
due to slowed population growth and shifts in population demographics, and it may not increase
in certain product markets given changes in consumer interests. Moreover, as we expand into
new geographic markets and product categories, we may not accurately predict consumer
preferences in that market or product category, which could result in lower than expected sales.
A decline in consumer spending on high-end design products could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be able to fully realize the Group’s commercial and strategic vision._**

We may experience difficulties in maximizing collaboration across the Group portfolio and
achieving our strategic vision, including taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities. We may
incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits and
synergies, including those of the acquisition of YDesign as described elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. We believe that the combined Group portfolio can continue to generate
synergies from, inter alia, cross-selling our brands in the same point of sale, the opening of new
multi-brand stores directly operated by us, sharing information on contracts and pipelines of new
offers among all of our businesses through a centralized Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) infrastructure, the centralization of certain administrative functions, the creation of a
central marketing team, launching a new joint direct e-commerce platform with distribution in
Europe and the U.S., optimizing warehousing and logistics functions in certain countries where
we operate and renegotiating contracts with logistics service providers, outsourcing the
production of architectural Louis Poulsen products and integrating and consolidating operations
and management across the geographies in which we operate. In addition, we believe the
acquisition of YDesign can generate additional synergies, as we expect to benefit from increased
sales of our products through YDesign Group’s e-commerce platform. The Acquisition of YDesign
will enable us to expand our international reach, given the YDesign Group’s solid positioning
within the market for online sales of lighting and furniture brands in the Unites States. Although
we expect the Group will benefit from such initiatives, there is no guarantee that the expected
synergies, including following the acquisition of YDesign, will be achieved in the expected

47


-----

timeframe or at all, or that the costs, both one-off and recurring, incurred to achieve such
synergies will not be greater than the synergies themselves. In particular, we may be unable to
successfully combine our operating structure and extensive distribution network with the online
sale platform operated by the YDesign Group efficiently or effectively and in that case we may
not be able to recover the cost incurred to obtain the envisaged synergies, including the costs
related to the improvement of the on-line sales platform of the YDesign Group and any potential
loss of revenues from existing customers of the YDesign Group who might prefer to sell their
products through our competitors maintaining that the YDesign Group focuses more on
promoting the Group’s products than theirs. See “—We may be unable to integrate YDesign
_effectively and realize the expected synergies from the Acquisition”, “—Risks Related to Our_
_Financial Information—The consolidated financial information of YDesign presented herein,_
_including as part of our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA, was prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP_
_and is therefore not comparable with the consolidated financial information of the Issuer, which_
_was prepared on the basis of IFRS” and “—Our Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized_
_EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum are based upon management estimates and_
_assumptions in respect of certain cost savings and revenue synergies. Such estimates and_
_assumptions might prove to be materially incorrect as a result of factors that are beyond our_
_control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors”._

We may also face integration risks in connection with any acquisition we make. In respect of our
European operations, creating a joint e-commerce platform might entail difficulties due to the
high fragmentation and extensive regulatory framework in Europe, or might not be successful
for certain of our products (such as furnishing products, for which customer on-site visits and
customization services play an important role), and may also adversely affect our relationships
with existing online retailers. See also “—We may not be able to successfully expand into new
_markets or grow our online presence on a timely basis, or at all, which could harm our growth_
_and results of operations”. The Group was formed as a result of the combination of three large_
and complex businesses that had historically been operated separately. Although we have been
successful to date, we cannot assure you that the management team will continue to effectively
direct the combined businesses or fully achieve the synergies from both the full integration of
Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen, including through the coordination of certain activities by the
centralized management team of the Group and the opening of multi-brand and multifunctional
flagships (“D-Studio”) and those synergies that we anticipate from the Acquisition of YDesign, as
presented in this Offering Memorandum. To the extent that we pursue further acquisitions in
line with our acquisition strategy, any of these risks may be further exacerbated. See “—We
_intend to carry out acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, which may not deliver anticipated_
_benefits”. The failure to achieve any part of the Group vision in terms of collaboration across the_
businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_We may be unable to integrate YDesign effectively and realize the expected synergies from the_**
**_Acquisition._**
In connection with the Acquisition and the integration of the YDesign Group into our existing
operating structure, we will seek to achieve annual synergies mainly deriving from (i) sales on the
YDesign platform of our products, including B&B products which are currently not sold by
YDesign and (ii) the support of the Group in respect of sales of YDesign private label products
which YDesign is currently in the process of setting up. We cannot be assured that we will be
able to realize any of these synergies, and the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies
may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits. Our
anticipated synergies are based on assumptions about our ability to implement these measures in
a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. If one or more of our underlying
assumptions regarding these initiatives proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to
substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the
anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits. Moreover, there might be liabilities of the Target
Group that are unknown to us or cannot be estimated at this time.

48


-----

Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive
us of some of the benefits from the cost measures that, in the calculation of the Pro Forma
Synergized EBITDA included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, we have assumed that we
will be able to retain. See ‘‘Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other
_Financial and Pro Forma Data’’ and ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’. Also, cost efficiencies from_
operational efficiencies may not be able to be sustained due to our inability to integrate the
acquired business, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues or other cost
variables. Our inability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and revenue
enhancements from the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of our brand names and designs may adversely affect_**
**_our competitive and financial position._**

Flos’, Louis Poulsen’s and B&B’s success is dependent, to a large extent, on the strength and
reputation of each of their brands and designs. In our view, safeguarding each of our brand
images is the basis for customer loyalty and essential to differentiate Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B
from their competitors. As such, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of
the brands and designs across each of our business divisions and sales channels and continue to
identify products and trends that meet the expectations of our target customers. Isolated or
recurring incidents that erode customer trust, such as faulty or low quality designs, delays in
delivery or suboptimal customer service, particularly if widely publicized online or litigated, and
not responded to effectively, could significantly impact our brands and have a negative impact
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our customers view a
brand and its design trend negatively during the launch of a product, it can be difficult to change
those perceptions in the future.

Moreover, some of our key designers have worked with us for several years and have significantly
contributed to shape our brands throughout our history. The loss of any of our key designers, or
any illegal, immoral or improper behavior of any of our key designers which is perceived
negatively by the public, could adversely affect our brand image and reputation. See “—Our
_business is in part dependent on our ability to negotiate, maintain and renew license agreements_
_with leading designers on satisfactory terms ” and “—The loss of certain key license agreements_
_could result in the loss of revenue and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition,_
_certain of our designers are not subject to non-compete obligations during the term of their_
_license agreements with us and/or following the termination thereof, and our business could be_
_adversely affected if they were to successfully cooperate with our competitors”._

Perception of our brands could also deteriorate if trends in luxury goods were to move away
from a preference for “made in Italy” or “made in Scandinavia” goods, if we are perceived to act
in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the protection of the
environment, the sourcing, disposal, content or sale of our products or the use of customer data,
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations or if we fail to deliver a consistently positive
customer experience in each of our markets. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brands and
other intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including
from unauthorized uses of our brand names or other intellectual property assets, can erode
customer trust and our brands’ value. See “—If we are unable to protect our license and other
_intellectual property rights from others, or if counterfeiting increases, our business may suffer,_
_and we may incur significant additional costs”. Any such erosion in the perceived value of our_
brand names and designs may adversely affect our competitive position and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B are each somewhat dependent on third-party
distributors of their products. For example, a vast majority of our distribution network comprises
mono-brand and multi-brand stores that are managed by third parties. These third-party
managers typically have their own processes, sales organizations and contracts with landlords
and may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate

49


-----

stores in a manner consistent with each of our brands’ standards and may not hire and train
qualified store managers and other personnel. See “—Our failure to effectively control our
_distribution network and their commercial practices could adversely affect our brand reputation._
_In addition, any disruption in the operations of our distributors or in our relationships with them_
_could adversely affect our business”. Should these third-party managers misrepresent our_
products (e.g., in terms of pricing or product presentation), act in an unethical or socially
irresponsible manner (including with respect to environmental protection), fail to comply with
laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive customer experience, the public
perception of our brands may deteriorate. In addition, certain of our products are manufactured
and assembled by third parties. Although we have quality assurance procedures in place to
continually monitor external production and assembly which are requested to comply with the
highest standard of quality and have not experienced material disruptions or other issues with
suppliers, our products could be manufactured or delivered in a manner inconsistent with our
standards, which could cause affect our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and adversely
affect our brand reputation. Any failure on the part of these third parties to preserve and build
our brands could compromise our reputation or the public’s perception of our brands, thereby
diminishing the value of such brands and potentially having a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to comply with local laws and regulations or other matters affecting compliance with
corporate governance best practices could also harm our corporate reputation. Damage to our
corporate reputation or loss of customer confidence for any of these or other reasons could
require additional investment to rebuild our reputation and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential reintroduction of_**
**_individual currencies within the Eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could_**
**_negatively impact our business or our ability to refinance our liabilities. In addition, economic_**
**_conditions and political uncertainty in Italy could affect our business._**

Economic and political events in recent years affecting European economies have raised a
number of questions regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary
Union. Credit risk in these countries and in other Eurozone countries could have a negative
impact on our business. Concerns also remain regarding the overall stability of the euro and the
suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances
in individual euro member states. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and
tensions in North Africa and Eastern Europe and other world events could adversely affect the
economies of the European Union (the “EU”) and those of other countries, which have been
severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future developments are dependent upon a number of
political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European
Commission and EU member states to counterbalance the negative consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic and to overcome endemic issues related to debt burdens of certain countries
in Europe, the overall stability of the Eurozone, the future relationship between the United
Kingdom and the EU, the influx of refugees in certain European countries and the rise of
populism in Europe.

The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, effective January 1, 2021, has come
with significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the
EU and its remaining member states and with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply
as the United Kingdom determines which EU-derived laws to replace or replicate following its
exit from the European Union, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade
agreements, intellectual property rights, supply chain logistics, environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations, immigration laws and employment laws. This uncertainty could increase
costs, depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital.

The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the
abandonment of the euro as a currency could have major negative effects on the Italian economy

50


-----

and therefore the Group. This is because Italy represents a significant market for us and is where
a large portion of our products are manufactured. As such, we would be particularly affected by
the occurrence of any such events. The departure of Italy from the euro would increase our
exposure to changes in currency rates and may result in the imposition of exchange controls,
among other economic measures. Any of these developments could affect our ability to refinance
our liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. Since 2017, Italy has experienced slow economic growth
and, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian economy contracted sharply
during the first half of 2020, recording a contraction in GDP of 5.4% in the first quarter of 2020,
followed by a 12.8% decrease in the second quarter of 2020, in each case as compared to the
previous quarter. Notwithstanding a rebound in the third quarter of the year with the GDP
growing by 16.1% as compared to the previous quarter, the fourth quarter showed a 1.9%
decrease compared to the previous quarter, with the government debt to GDP ratio being
155.8% as of December 31, 2020, increasing of 21.2 percentage points compared to the previous
year (source: ISTAT).

COVID-19 has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on Italy’s economy
and its public finances. This is due to a decline in tourism, weaker consumer spending and lower
industrial production. In April 2020, Fitch Ratings downgraded Italy’s sovereign credit rating to
BBB- from BBB while indicating a stable outlook, and recently affirmed such rating and outlook
in December 2020. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Moody’s Investors Service has
not changed Italy’s sovereign credit rating which remains at Baa3 with a stable outlook. In April
2021, S&P Global Ratings confirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating and outlook at BBB/A-2 with a
stable outlook. Further downgrades of the Italian sovereign debt could create additional
economic uncertainty and could have an adverse effect on our credit ratings. In addition,
prolonged political instability in Italy may result in decreased demand for our products or in
challenges to conducting our business as usual. This in turn may give rise to a decrease in prices
and profitability levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We may also be affected by political uncertainty in Italy, the
emergence of which may negatively impact business confidence. While the current government is
supported by a large majority of the Italian parliament, coalition governments in Italy have in the
past failed, and it remains unclear whether the current government will be able to adequately
address impediments to the country’s growth, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
such as the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP, the write-down of non-performing loans and the
reduction of unemployment in Italy. In addition, the deployment of funds destined to boost
Italy’s economic performance over the next years pursuant to the Recovery and Resilience Plan
recently adopted by the Italian government is tied to the government being able to implement
the reform plan pre-agreed with the European Commission. Therefore, any such failure to
implement these reforms might directly impact Italy’s positioning within the European Union and
therefore negatively affect its economic rebound. Furthermore, the government may take
positions that further exacerbate economic uncertainty in Italy which, in turn, may contribute to
recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.

The continued impact of the adverse global, European and Italian economic and market
conditions, including, among others, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—The
_COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or_
_outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._

**_We are party to license agreements with designers which require us to pay royalty and other_**
**_fees and, in limited cases, to make certain expenditures._**

Our business depends on the sale of innovative, design-driven products developed by well-known
designers. While our license arrangements differ from designer to designer and across our three
companies, most agreements provide for periodic payments of royalties or similar fees based on a
percentage of net sales or a percentage of the costs incurred by the relevant company to

51


-----

manufacture the relevant products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid
€10.4 million in royalties to designers. In very few cases, license agreements require us to pay
minimum guaranteed amounts and may also include advertising fees payable to the relevant
designer or investments to be made by us. Under certain circumstances, minimum guaranteed
amounts or fixed fees may result in us having to make payments that exceed the amount of
income we are able to generate from actual sales of the licensed designs. In addition, from time
to time, we may make upfront advances of royalties or loans to licensors. Furthermore, renewal
of a license can lead to renegotiation of commercial terms, which may not be as favorable as the
original terms. As a result, there are circumstances in which our payments to certain licensors
could exceed our income earned pursuant to the relevant license, such as when we are renewing
a key license or when the value of a design or perception of a designer among consumers has
become impaired. Any increases in the fees and royalties that we pay designers, especially if
those increases result in our payments surpassing the revenue obtained from the design, could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates._**

Our reporting currency is the euro. Given we operate on an international level, we are exposed
to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily related to (i) the fact that a portion of our revenues
and costs is denominated in currencies different from our relevant reporting currency and (ii) the
translation effect resulting from the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries which report in a
currency different from the relevant group reporting currency (such as Louis Poulsen, which
reports in Danish krone, which maintains a fixed-exchange-rate policy vis-à-vis the Euro with a
limited scope in fluctuation range). For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 64.7%,
12.6%, 12.0% and 3.2% of our revenues were denominated in euro, U.S. dollar, Danish krone
and yen, respectively.

Although we generate most of our revenues and incur most of our costs in euro, our exposure to
the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar against the euro is expected to increase as a result of the
acquisition of YDesign, which reports in U.S. dollar. In particular, YDesign’s revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $163.2 million and the effects on our consolidated
financial results are only partially offset by the fact that YDesign’s costs are also denominated in
U.S. dollars.

Continuous fluctuation in currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating
results and financial condition, particularly in relation to our cash flows, which could be affected
by outstanding nominal foreign currency financial and trade receivables or payables, incurred
prior to, but due to be settled after, a change to the relevant exchange rate. Changes in currency
exchange rates may also have a long-term impact on demand for our products, with relative
increases in the value of the euro, yen, U.S. dollar or the Danish krone, as applicable, as
compared to other currencies making products more expensive for international customers and
resulting in a decrease in revenue. Any increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of foreign
currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

As we generate most of our revenue and incur most of our costs in euro, we have chosen not to
engage in foreign exchange hedging, as we believe that the amount of revenue generated in
currencies other than the euro naturally offsets the costs incurred in such other currencies.
However, Louis Poulsen normally enters into forward exchange contracts to secure sales
denominated in Japanese yen, Swedish kroner and Norwegian kroner.

**_If our relationship with key suppliers of certain raw materials, components or finished products_**
**_deteriorate or if we experience any operational difficulties with such key suppliers, our business_**
**_could be adversely affected._**

Each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B normally sources raw materials from a diversified network of
suppliers. However, if the relationships with certain of these key suppliers were to deteriorate,
we may experience increased costs and may not be able to develop relationships with new

52


-----

suppliers in a timely manner or in a manner that is sufficient to supply any shortfall. Such an
outcome could occur if one or more of such key suppliers decides to no longer work with us,
demands higher prices or more stringent payment terms or is unable to meet the quantity or
quality of our product requirements, as a result of a natural disaster, pandemics, labor strikes,
financial difficulties or otherwise. Certain of our supply agreements also contain expiry dates
without automatic renewal provisions. In addition, although Louis Poulsen sourced components
and materials from approximately 225-250 suppliers in 2020, its top ten suppliers in accounted
for approximately 60% of its sourcing value. If we experience a significant increase in demand or
need to replace an existing supplier or add new suppliers to the existing ones, substitute
suppliers may not exist or be prepared to supply branded products to meet our requirements. For
new or substitute suppliers, we may encounter lack of capacity or delays in delivery. Moreover, a
few of our products contain sophisticated high-end materials, such as mouth blown glass, the
supply of which is limited. At times, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, we experienced delays in the sourcing of mouth-blown glass or of certain LED
components of our lamps, resulting in limited delivery delays of our products. Even if we were
able to identify new suppliers, we may experience delays, increased costs, product shortages and
customer back orders as we transition our product requirements to alternative suppliers. In
addition, any new supplier with which we do business may be subject to the same or similar
quality and quantity-related risks as our existing suppliers. Any such developments could increase
our cost of sales and adversely affect our overall profit margins.

We may also experience operational difficulties with certain suppliers, especially in connection
with complex contract projects, such as a reduction in the availability of production capacity,
errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control or failures to meet
production deadlines.

In addition, despite having procedures in place to monitor our suppliers, we may not be able to
monitor their subcontractors or other parties, if any, to whom they have outsourced part of the
manufacturing process. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality
products to our customers and stores on a timely basis, which could, in turn, have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_If prices of the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components_**
**_or finished products we purchase were to increase, our business could be adversely affected to_**
**_the extent we are not able to pass any such price increases on to our customers._**

Although raw materials and other components we purchase from suppliers often represent a
relatively small percentage of the price of our products, our margins are partially impacted by
the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our products and the costs of
the raw materials and components required to make these products, or of the finished or semifinished products we purchase where manufacturing activities are outsourced. In addition,
whenever manufacturing activities are outsourced (such as for most of Flos’ decorative products),
fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials utilized by the third-party suppliers in their
manufacturing processes may also affect prices paid by us for the supply of finished or semifinished products. Most of our contractual arrangements with suppliers do not protect us from
price increases and price lists are revisited quite frequently.

The availability and price of raw materials and components are influenced by factors over which
we have limited control, such as market conditions, general global economic prospects,
production capacity, production constraints on the part of our suppliers, fluctuations in global
prices, infrastructure failures, political conditions, weather conditions, regulations and other
factors. Increases in raw material or other component prices could place strains on our working
capital requirements if we are unable to increase the prices of our products proportionally.
Moreover, if we pass the increase in sourcing costs on to our customers by raising the prices of
our products, the demand for our products may decline, in particular if competitors choose not to
raise prices. In turn, if we are unable to pass cost increases related to raw materials or
components and other costs on to our customers, we may experience pressure on our gross

53


-----

margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. Additionally, delays or interruptions in supply could in turn
cause delays in the delivery of our products to customers, increase the chance of litigation with
customers, place increased pressure on our margins and reduce our cash flow. Any of these
possibilities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations, as well as impair our ability to fulfil our financing obligations or make further
investments in our business.

Given that we do not normally use derivatives to hedge the price fluctuation risk of raw
materials, if prices of raw materials are volatile in the future, we might need to constantly adjust
our sales prices to maintain sufficient profitability, especially in an environment of rising raw
material prices. In response to changes in demand levels, our competitors may price their
products more aggressively in order to retain market share, which could result in an adverse
market environment for us in the short term until the market reaches a new equilibrium. There
may be other unforeseen effects which we cannot predict given the volatility of raw material
prices. Any such event that results in a material increase in the price of raw materials or other
products sourced from third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for certain of our_**
**_products and to adequately manage our product inventory._**
The investments we make in our businesses are in part driven by our expectations of the future
success of our products. For those of our products that are not made to order (such as Flos’
decorative collection and certain of LP’s B2C products) and/or that are produced externally (such
as most outdoor products and certain product components of B&B), we often forecast inventory
needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers and
manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand. Although we frequently adjust our
estimates to reflect demand trends and have not experienced material issues in the past
notwithstanding the prolonged effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to accurately
forecast demand for such products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or
decrease in demand for our products or for our competitors’ products, unanticipated changes in
general market conditions and changes in economic conditions. For a description of the impact
that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business and results of operations, please see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group—COVID-19”. See also “—The_
_COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or_
_outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._

If we underestimate demand for a particular product, our third-party manufacturers and
suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of that product or material to meet our
requirements, and we may experience increased delivery times or a shortage of that product
available for sale or distribution. The shortage of a popular product or an increase in delivery
times could adversely affect our brand, our customer relationships and our ability to attract
additional customers. Alternatively, inventory levels in excess of demand may result in inventory
write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at further discounted prices, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. Moreover, the YDesign Group does not manufacture any products in
house and, once orders are received, depending on the availability of such products at YDesign
Group’s warehouse, the company either ships on-hand products directly or instructs the relevant
vendor to mail directly to the customer. Any failure by these vendors to properly and timely
manage the preparation and shipping of our customers’ orders may harm YDesign’s and our
reputation and therefore have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

54

**_Any disruption relating to our manufacturing or assembly facilities or warehouses or to our_**
**_distribution and delivery processes could have a materially adverse impact on our business._**

Flos owns four assembly facilities and warehouses in Italy, Flos’ subsidiary Ares S.r.l. (“Ares”)
owns three production facilities and two warehouses in Italy, Flos’ Antares subsidiary leases its
headquarters in Spain, Louis Poulsen leases a manufacturing facility and warehouse in Denmark
and warehouses in the United States, Japan and Singapore and B&B owns two manufacturing
facilities and operates two leased warehouses and one manufacturing facility in Italy for
Arclinea. A majority of Flos’ products and a limited percentage of Louis Poulsen’s products are
manufactured pursuant to their specifications by third-party manufacturers or are otherwise
sourced as input parts from third-party suppliers. The YDesign Group does not manufacture any
products in house. In addition, our finished products are delivered to our customers
internationally from either our distribution centers in Italy, Denmark, the United States and Asia.
The orderly operation of our manufacturing and delivery processes depends on adherence to
manufacturing, assembling and shipping schedules and effective management of the facilities
through which we and other third-party manufacturers operate. All of these facilities are subject
to operational risk, including, but not limited to:

- equipment failure or interruptions in power supplies;

- failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards;

- failure to maintain necessary permits and approvals;

- material supply disruptions;

- import quotas;

- labor force shortages or work stoppages;

- environmental conditions;

- events impeding or increasing the cost of transporting our products, including enhanced
security measures at U.S. and other international ports;

- natural or man-made disasters;

- fires or floods; and

- terrorist attacks or political unrest.

Any significant disruption in operations to our manufacturing facilities or our distribution centers
resulting from these or other events may, to the extent not covered by our business interruption
insurance or if such insurance claims are not paid promptly, have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of the components we manufacture
in-house, such as large foam components of B&B sofas, may be difficult to source externally, and
any material disruption in the relevant production machinery could cause severe delays in the
delivery of such products. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead
times associated with distributing merchandise to our customers during the time it takes for us to
reopen, restore or replace our manufacturing or assembly facilities or warehouses and any refund
from our business interruption insurance may prove to be insufficient.

In addition to our manufacturing and assembly operations, we rely upon various means of
transportation, primarily provided by third parties, to deliver products from third-party
manufacturers or assemblers to our warehouses and from our warehouses to our customers.
Labor shortages or capacity constraints in the transportation industry, financial distress or
bankruptcy of our couriers, disruptions to the national and international transportation
infrastructure, domestic and international travel restrictions, fuel shortages or transportation cost
increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees) could have a material adverse effect on our
business and operating results, including as a result of any material adverse effect on YDesign’s
business, which resorts to third parties for the distribution of products to its customers. For

55


-----

example, in 2017, Flos’ main courier in Italy, Artoni, was admitted to extraordinary
administration by the competent court, which led to some minor delays in the delivery of Flos’
products. In addition, in 2020, we experienced delays in delivering products from third-party
manufacturers or assemblers to our warehouses and from our warehouses to our customers, due
to the closure of these manufacturers or assemblers facilities and/or to the travel restrictions
imposed by certain governments to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection. In addition, B&B
experienced certain operational issues relating to planning and order scheduling that affected
B&B’s performance in the first half of 2020 and which were promptly resolved by the second half
of the year. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to
_pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other_
_epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”. Any of these_
disruptions to our logistics organization, whether to our manufacturing and warehouse facilities
or to the transport systems that we rely on to get our products to our customers, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled_**
**_employees. The loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations._**

We believe that the members of our senior management team are key to our business. Retention
of senior management is important in our business due to the limited availability of experienced
and talented executives. We have put in place policies and remuneration designed to retain and
incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to retain and
properly incentivize management or to find suitable replacements should any of them leave us.
Competition for such personnel is significant, and we may not be able to attract and retain a
sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. We also face the challenge of attracting,
developing and retaining qualified staff for our directly operated stores, manufacturing plants,
distribution centers and aftermarket services teams while controlling our labor costs. Our ability
to support our strategy may be limited by our ability to employ, train, motivate and retain
sufficient skilled personnel such as manufacturing staff, store managers, and aftermarket service
providers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to employ any of these key personnel
or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Should key
personnel leave in significant numbers or if a critical member of senior management were to
leave unexpectedly, or if any of these were to join any of our competitors, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

**_We may be subject to production and litigation risks associated with our commercial contract_**
**_divisions._**

Each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B operate business divisions dedicated to contract projects for
commercial properties. Flos’ Architectural and Outdoor divisions, which provide lighting solutions
primarily for sophisticated, high-end commercial applications including retail stores, hotels,
offices and outdoor markets, and, from time to time, exclusive residential properties, generated
24.0% of Flos’ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Louis Poulsen’s B2B business
comprises sales to specifiers in professional projects, such as architects, lighting designers, interior
designers and building engineers, of both indoor and outdoor lighting solutions and for the year
ended December 31, 2020 generated 32.4% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue. B&B’s Contract division,
which delivers custom “turn-key” furniture solutions and finishes in the residential, hospitality,
retail and office sectors, generated 9.5% of B&B’s revenue for the year ended December 31,
2020. Contract projects are generally complex and must be completed to high, bespoke
specifications. Although we typically request advance payments on contract projects in order to
minimize credit risk, given the inherent complexity, large scale and extended duration of these
projects, we remain exposed to financial risks related to, among other things, the
non-performance of a contract due to bankruptcy or other operational or financial issues of the
counterparty, as well as the delay of a project decided by our customer. Moreover, especially in
connection with B&B’s bigger contract business, when we do receive advance payments, we may
from time to time be required to provide customers with bank guarantees and/or performance

56


-----

bonds, which could be enforced if we were to default on our contractual obligations for any
reasons, including as a consequence of a delay from one of our suppliers. As of December 31,
2020, B&B bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties amounted to
€8.5 million, €6.0 million of which related to contracts in the hospitality sector. Contract projects
also expose Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B to significant litigation risks due to the non-performance
of a contract arising out of difficulties with suppliers, transportation systems or manufacturing
facilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had set aside provisions of €2.9 million in connection with
these and other minor pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the scale of each project, as well
as the wide visibility on certain commercial projects, exposes each company to reputational harm
should they fail to meet the client’s expectations regarding project design or product quality. Any
monetary loss, litigation or reputational harm arising from Flos’, Louis Poulsen’s or B&B’s
exposure to large scale projects in their respective commercial contract divisions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_Louis Poulsen’s B2B division may be exposed to credit and regulatory risk associated with its_**
**_activities with public entities._**

Louis Poulsen’s B2B division comprises sales to specifiers in professional projects, such as
architects, lighting designers, interior designers and building engineers, of both indoor and
outdoor lighting solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the B2B division generated
32.4% of Louis Poulsen’s total revenue. Although Louis Poulsen’s B2B customers represent a wide
range of industries, the vast majority of B2B Outdoor customers are public entities primarily
located in Denmark and the U.S., but also in other European countries. As a result, a significant
portion of Louis Poulsen’s revenue is dependent on governments’ and public authorities’
programs and funding policies, as well as economic and political conditions. As governments and
other public entities suffer from budget deficits, changes in regulations and changes in sentiment
around public spending, their capacity to fund high-end designs from Louis Poulsen’s B2B division
could be materially affected. As a consequence of poor economic conditions or budget cuts,
governments or local public authorities may call off or reconsider potential projects, exercise
their right to terminate contracts, attempt to renegotiate contract terms in order to reduce costs
or delay the time of payment, exposing Louis Poulsen to a significantly reduced demand for new
B2B contracts or increased credit risk on existing contracts. Any decrease in spending by public
sector entities on commercial lighting projects could adversely affect Louis Poulsen’s profit
margin, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow.

**_Our presence outside Europe exposes our companies to local business risks that could negatively_**
**_affect our operations and growth strategy outside Europe._**

We operate across five continents and, directly or indirectly, in approximately 140 countries.
While the majority of our revenue currently derives from our operations in Europe, we believe
that revenue from sales outside Europe will continue to grow in the foreseeable future, including
as a result of our acquisition of YDesign. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks resulting
from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions and
unforeseeable developments in a variety of jurisdictions, including emerging markets. These risks
include, among other things:

- political instability;

- differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;

- disruption of our operations;

- unexpected changes in regulatory environments or economic policies;

- varying tax regimes, including with respect to the imposition of withholding taxes on
remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries;

- fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

57


-----

- inability to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague
commercial or other laws;

- transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels and
suppliers;

- insufficient protection against product piracy and other violations of our intellectual property
rights;

- foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds; and

- difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees, or further
rationalizing our work force.

Our expansion into markets outside of Europe requires us to respond to rapid changes in market
conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, to a considerable
extent, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage differing legal, political, social and
regulatory requirements and economic conditions and unforeseeable developments. We cannot
assure you that we will continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and
strategies which will be effective in each location where we do business. Any inability to
successfully expand and conduct our business outside of Europe could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws_**
**_and regulations and economic sanction programs._**
Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of
various jurisdictions. We are also required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations,
such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery
Act of 2010 (the “Bribery Act”), any law or regulation implementing the OECD Convention on
Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and
economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the United Nations, the EU, the
U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”), the U.S. Department of State and Her Majesty’s
Treasury of the United Kingdom. The FCPA prohibits providing anything of value to foreign
officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business
advantage. As a result of doing business in foreign countries, we are exposed to a risk of
violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we,
our partners or agents operate. Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a
developed legal system and have high levels of corruption. Our continued expansion and
worldwide operations, including in developing countries, the development of joint venture
relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we
operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, OFAC or similar laws. As a result,
from time to time we may be subject to proceedings and investigations relating to such laws and
regulations. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil
penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from
government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of
licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, any major violations could have
a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business.
While we believe that we have a strong culture of compliance and adequate systems of control,
we seek to continuously improve our systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses
identified. There can be no assurance, however, that the policies and procedures have been or
will be followed at all times (including by companies that we acquired) or effectively detect and
prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our directors, officers, employees,
consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be able to successfully expand into new markets or grow our online presence on a_**
**_timely basis, or at all, which could harm our growth and results of operations._**
Our growth will be in part dependent on our ability to continue to open profitable new stores
and increase our online presence. Our strategies include the opening of seven to ten multi brand
stores in the next four years in strategic areas and the creation of a new multi-brand e-commerce
platform with distribution in Europe and the U.S. (see also “—We may not be able to fully realize
_the Group’s commercial and strategic vision”). Our ability to increase the number of our stores_
will depend in part on the availability of store sites, either directly owned or operated by third
parties, that meet our specifications. We may face competition from other retailers for suitable
locations and we may also face difficulties in negotiating leases on acceptable terms. In addition,
a lack of available financing on terms acceptable to real estate developers or a tightening credit
market may adversely affect the retail sites available to us. Rising real estate and acquisition,
construction and development costs and available lease financing could also inhibit our ability to
open or acquire new stores. Our growth strategy is also highly dependent on our e-commerce
activities and our ability to reach customers worldwide, in particular in the lighting industry. Due
to the low barrier to entry to online platforms, we may face intensified competition from other
high-end design stores that are also growing their presence online via e-commerce. Moreover,
creating a joint e-commerce platform might entail difficulties in certain geographies, such as
Europe due to its high fragmentation, or might not be successful for certain of our products (such
as furnishing products, for which customer on-site visits and customization services play an
important role), and may also adversely affect our relationships with existing online retailers.

Our expansion into new and existing markets via physical locations or e-commerce may present
competitive, distribution, merchandising and regulatory challenges that differ from our current
challenges, including competition among our stores, diminished novelty of our store design and
concept, added strain on our distribution centers, additional information to be processed by our
information technology systems and diversion of management attention from operations. As we
grow our e-commerce activities and as we open stores in new markets, where we are less familiar
with consumer trends and buying patterns and our brands are less well-known, we may face
different or additional risks and increased costs compared to opening new stores in existing
markets. For example, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in new markets,
which could result in lower than expected sales. A growing online presence and expansion into
new markets could also bring us into direct competition with retailers with whom we have no
past experience as direct competitors. To the extent that we are not able to meet these new
challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase. Furthermore, our
margins may be impacted in periods in which incremental expenses are incurred as a result of
new store openings. Any failure on our part to successfully implement our expansion strategy,
either through physical stores or online, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

**_System interruptions that impair customer access to our sites, performance failures in our_**
**_technology infrastructure or data security breaches could damage our business, reputation and_**
**_brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations._**
The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our brand websites, transaction
processing systems and technology infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to
acquire and retain customers, as well as maintain adequate customer service levels.

If our computer servers or communications hardware fail, or if we suffer from an interruption or
degradation of technology services, we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment
deadlines, which could harm our business through exposure to litigation or reputational harm.
Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods,
power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, data loss, acts of war,
break-ins, earthquake and similar events. In addition, some of the digital data we collect and
process are stored and managed by third-party infrastructure operators that manage the servers
underlying our IT platform, and any data security thefts, cyber-attacks or other material
disruption affecting such operators could in turn adversely affect our operations and

59


-----

relationships with our customers. Our revenue depends in part on the number of visitors who
shop on our sites and on the volume of orders we can handle. Unavailability of our sites or
reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of goods sold and could also
materially adversely affect consumer perception of our brand.

In addition, continued growth in our transaction volume, as well as surges in online traffic and
orders associated with promotional activities or launches in our business, could place additional
demands on our technology platform and could cause or exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions.
If there is a substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our sites or the number of orders
placed by customers, we will be required to further expand and upgrade our technology,
transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our sites or
expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases on a timely
basis. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the
responsiveness, functionality and features of our sites and our information technology (“IT”)
systems and infrastructure. This is particularly challenging given the rapid rate at which new
technologies, customer preferences and expectations and industry standards and practices are
evolving. In order to keep pace with these evolving trends, we have from time to time
redesigned and enhanced and we are currently redesigning and enhancing various functions on
our sites and/or our IT systems and infrastructure and we may experience instability and
performance issues as a result of these changes. Our disaster recovery plan may be inadequate,
and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses
that could occur. Any slowdown or failure of our sites and the underlying technology
infrastructure could harm our reputation and impede our ability to acquire, retain and serve our
customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

**_More stringent regulations, including in the area of consumer data privacy, could adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**
We are subject to laws and regulations in a number of areas, including consumer data protection.
In the ordinary course of business, we are required to process the personal data of our customers.
The regulatory environment governing the use of individually identifiable data of customers,
employees and others is complex. Privacy and information security laws and requirements change
frequently and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary system
changes and implement new administrative processes. Any processing of the personal data of
individuals located in the European Economic Area in the course of the provision of services is
governed by the EU data protection regime. On May 24, 2016, the EU adopted the General Data
Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”) with the aim to, among other things,
strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU. The GDPR became
effective in each EU Member State on May 25, 2018, replacing the former European data
protection regulatory framework. The GDPR increased our regulatory burden, in terms of
compliance with the new rules, as well as the maximum level of fines for non-compliance. In
particular, the GDPR obligates European Union-based companies or companies that process
personal data about European Union subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data
processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate, for example, to (i) the
processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage
limitation, security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate
compliance with such principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis
before the processing and (iv) the rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a
right of access, the right to rectification and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates companies
to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy
implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies or types of
data. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in significant penalties including fines of up to
4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher), depending on the
type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures
that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). Our

60


-----

data security insurance coverage is limited and we cannot guarantee that our data security
insurance coverage or our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or
any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Moreover, evolving regulation
relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs and affect
or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data.
Compliance with, and monitoring of such laws and regulations is demanding, time consuming
and costly. Further, such laws and regulations, including their interpretation and application,
change from time to time, and such changes could impose new burdens and expose us to further
liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, in the aftermath of temporary personnel
initiatives implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a reliance on remote
working, as well as an increased amount of employee health data being processed, our exposure
to this risk is temporarily heightened. The European Commission has proposed enhanced
regulations concerning privacy and electronic communications (the “e-Privacy Regulation”),
which would entail additional and stricter rules than those established under the GDPR in respect
of the use of personal data from electronic communications. The e-Privacy Regulation would
establish fines similar to those included in GDPR. These regulations may affect the development
of innovative services that would draw on consumer data, potentially creating a competitive
disadvantage for undertakings subject to both the GDPR and the e-Privacy Regulation.

If we were found to be subject to and in violation of any of these laws or other data privacy laws
or regulations, we would likely be required to change our business practices and may be exposed
to litigation and regulatory penalties and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a data security breach occurs, our
reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits. The customer
data could be either stolen or misappropriated at any stage of data processing, such as receipt,
transmission, use or storage of the data. If any loss or misappropriation were to occur, customers
may be unwilling to provide us with their data and direct marketing could be negatively affected
as a result. Furthermore, a loss or misappropriation of customer data could result in negative
publicity, which could damage our reputation and result in lower sales.

Finally, our operations are subject to certain environmental, product safety and other laws and
regulations applicable to our products. Any change in these laws and regulations could restrict
our ability to export products to certain markets, result in increased production or distribution
costs or require us to replace certain raw materials or components at higher cost, which could
cause delays in the delivery of our products. For example, in 2018, the U.S. introduced certain
bans on formaldehyde-releasing agents which are often found in, among other things, resins
used in the manufacture of composite wood products, glues, paints, coatings and lacquers. As a
result of these new rules, B&B had to adjust its manufacturing processes to ensure that no such
agents were contained in its products, which caused minor delays in the delivery of certain
products to the U.S. B&B’s general approach to such situations is to promptly adapt its
manufacturing standards and processes to the highest industry standards required by the laws of
the countries in which it operates, as these may change from time to time. Although this change
did not result in any material cost increases, there can be no assurance that future changes in
environmental, product safety or other regulations would not result in material increases in raw
material costs or delays in production for B&B or any other companies in the Group. Any such
change in regulation, any theft or misappropriation of customer data, or any failure to abide by
other laws or regulations governing data privacy or other areas of our operations could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may fail to implement or maintain adequate monitoring and control systems as provided for_**
**_under Italian law or they might be insufficient to prevent the violation of laws and regulations._**

As Italian companies, the Issuer, Flos and B&B are subject to Italian Legislative Decree
No. 231/2001 (“LD 231/2001”), which is aimed, inter alia, at preventing direct or indirect acts of
corruption, bribery, anti-competitive behavior, money laundering, fraud, environmental crimes,
health and safety crimes and any other illegal or otherwise unethical conduct. Pursuant to LD

61


-----

231/2001, each of the Issuer, Flos and B&B have implemented internal controls and monitoring
systems aimed at detecting and preventing such conduct. Although the Issuer, Flos and B&B have
maintained and utilized these controls and monitoring systems, these systems may be unable to
detect or prevent every instance of unethical conduct involving our directors, employees,
consultants, partners, internal and third-party agents, representatives and intermediaries. In
addition, the Issuer, Flos or B&B may fail to adequately update such systems. Even if
implemented, updated and maintained, these monitoring systems, including internal controls
and procedures at each of the Issuer, Flos and B&B, may not be sufficient to protect, detect and
identify inadequate practices or violations of law.

Any of the foregoing circumstances, including our failure to adequately update such monitoring
systems, may expose us to civil and administrative penalties, including pursuant to the provisions
of LD 231/2001, as well as to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. In particular,
pursuant to LD 231/2001, we may be held responsible for certain crimes committed in Italy or
abroad (including, among others, corruption, fraud against the state, corporate offenses, market
abuse, certain environmental violations and workplace safety violations) in our interest or for our
benefit by individuals having a functional relationship with us at the time the relevant crime was
committed, including third-party agents, partners or intermediaries, unless we were able to
prove that such individuals fraudulently violated such internal control model and it was
impossible for us to avoid such violation. In such circumstances, we may be subject to fines,
confiscation of profits or legal sanctions, including, subject to certain conditions, the termination
of authorizations, permits, licenses, concessions and financing arrangements, including facilitated
financing, suspension of our operations, or prohibitions on contracting with public authorities.
The duration of these disqualifications range from a minimum of three months to a maximum of
two years, although in very serious cases, some of these disqualifications can be applied
permanently. Certain of the abovementioned legal sanctions may also be applied as interim
measures during investigations. As an alternative to the legal sanctions, the court may appoint a
judicial custodian to run the company, with the consequence that the profits gained during the
receivership period are automatically confiscated. Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our results of operations are partially exposed to seasonal fluctuations, and results for any_**
**_quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full_**
**_financial year._**

The quarterly results of each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B have fluctuated in the past and may
fluctuate in the future, depending upon a variety of factors, including, among other things,
product launches, store openings and closings, annual design or furniture fairs and exhibitions
(such as the Salone Internazionale del Mobile in Milan), shifts in the timing of holidays, timing of
delivery of orders and competitive factors. For example, unseasonable weather conditions may
reduce footfall in certain shopping areas and reduce demand for certain product categories, such
as outdoor furniture from the B&B Italia Outdoor line and outdoor lighting from Flos and Louis
Poulsen, which could also have an impact on our quarterly results.

In particular, the results of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B have in the past been partly affected by
seasonal patterns of new product launches. More generally, we typically generate, and expect to
continue to generate, a large portion of our revenue in the fourth quarter of the year. Such
seasonality occurs in connection with the launch of new products, increased demand for indoor
lighting during the darker winter months and promotions associated with Black Friday in
November and Christmas in December. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Conditions and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of_
_the Group—Seasonality”. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements reach_
their highest level in the third quarter Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B ramp up their production and
internal sales efforts in preparation for new product launches and increased customer demand
during the fourth quarter. Due to our significant fixed cost base, represented by rent and
employee wages and salaries, if we experience lower sales during the fourth quarter or other
periods of high demand, we may be unable to reduce our costs in the short term to offset the

62


-----

lower revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Demands on our logistics chain also fluctuate during the year in response to seasonal trends in
our business. For example, the weeks immediately preceding the holiday selling season in the
fourth quarter are a particularly demanding period for some parts of our logistics organization,
as well as the weeks immediately preceding the summer season for our outdoor products, as
inventory volumes tend to be higher to cope with anticipated demand. Any disruption in our
supply or logistics chain during that period would therefore have an outsized effect on our
results of operations. See also “—Any disruption relating to our manufacturing or assembly
_facilities or warehouses or to our distribution and delivery processes could have a materially_
_adverse impact on our business”._

As a result of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may fluctuate on a seasonal basis,
as well as relative to corresponding periods in prior years. We may also engage in marketing
campaigns that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season. Due to the seasonality inherent in
the lighting and furnishings industry, period-on-period comparisons of our results of operations
may not necessarily be meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future
performance.

**_We intend to carry out acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, which may not deliver_**
**_anticipated benefits._**

We intend to continue to acquire companies or assets in the high-end design market or adjacent
markets in the future as a key part of our growth strategy and such transactions could be
significant or transformational in size and importance for the Group. The success of such strategy
is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due
diligence, negotiate transactions on terms that are favorable for us, complete such transactions
and integrate the acquired businesses. Our objective of acquiring further companies in the future
depends on, among other things, the existence of suitable acquisition targets and our ability to
finance their acquisition.

If we carry out acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate expected
margins or cash flows or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including expected
growth or synergies. Our analysis and assessments of potential targets are subject to a number of
assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. There can
be no assurance that our assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to
be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Furthermore,
we may use debt financing for any acquisitions, which could be material and would in any event
increase our debt service requirements, or we may use operating cash flows to finance
acquisitions, which would decrease our retained earnings and the amount of cash on our balance
sheet. In order to manage any acquisitions we successfully complete, we will need to expand and
continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems. Our excess
cash may be limited, and we may not be able to invest in the acquired company to integrate the
acquired business and achieve the desired synergies. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings
and synergies may be affected by a number of difficulties and risks, including, but not limited to:

- the loss of customers, suppliers or key employees;

- our ability to reduce expenses by eliminating duplicative overhead and functions and
rationalizing manufacturing and/or distributing capacity in a timely manner;

- our ability to optimize procurement savings with respect to raw materials and other supplies;

- unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, accounting, cultural and other issues;

- difficulty in standardizing existing information and systems and consolidating facilities and
infrastructure;

63


-----

- failure to maintain the quality of the products that is associated with our existing brands;

- added costs caused by dealing with such disruptions;

- unforeseen challenges from operating in new geographic areas; and

- the diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day management as a result of the
need to deal with the aforementioned disruptions and difficulties.

If we are unable to address, among others, the above mentioned risks, they could cause us to fail
to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including any targeted operational and
organizational synergies.

In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, in spite of the due diligence we perform, we
may inadvertently or unknowingly acquire actual or potential liabilities, including legal claims,
claims for breach of contract, local authority proceedings, employment related claims,
environmental liabilities, anti-corruption and sanctions law violations or tax liabilities. Finally, to
the extent we divest any of our businesses, we may also incur contingent liabilities in connection
with any indemnity we provide to the purchaser in connection with such divestiture. If any of the
above were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, any future acquisitions, particularly material or transformational acquisitions of
larger businesses or business units, may prove more difficult to integrate into our business,
increasing the risk that such acquisitions may not be successful. Transformational or material
acquisitions would require significant financial and operating resources and we do not have
experience undertaking such large acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions of businesses outside our
core geographical markets may present additional challenges due to legal, cultural and linguistic
differences and the difficulties presented by integrating and managing a business that is
geographically more remote. Moreover, transformational or material acquisitions may result in
unfavorable external perceptions of the transaction or us, creating the potential for ratings
downgrades or adversely affecting the market price of the Notes. Similarly, any acquisitions of
businesses operating in adjacent market segments could further exacerbate the difficulties in
integrating such businesses.

Future acquisition opportunities and mergers may require approvals from antitrust and other
authorities under antitrust or other regulation in force at the time in any one of a number of
jurisdictions. For instance, if such approvals of a proposed acquisition or merger prove necessary,
approval of the transaction may require, based on the relevant antirust authority’s evaluation of
prevailing market conditions and our position in the market, that we divest certain businesses in
order to carry out the transaction. We may also be prohibited by antitrust authorities from
carrying out the transaction. Furthermore, we could, as a consequence of our strong positions in
certain of our markets, be considered by antitrust regulatory authorities to have a dominant
position which could subject us to certain limitations in our ability to act on the market by
adjusting our prices or otherwise. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our
ability to execute our strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Finally, we may enter into joint ventures, business alliances or collaboration agreements, which
could involve the same or similar risks and uncertainties as are involved in acquisitions. Joint
ventures, for example, generally involve a lesser degree of control over business operations,
which may in the future present financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks. We may
invest substantial amounts in these joint ventures and cannot be assured that they will produce
expected returns. Any inability to achieve projected synergies or properly address operational
risks, either with regard to joint ventures or acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our substantial amount of intangible assets could adversely affect our consolidated net income_**
**_and our capitalization._**

As of December 31, 2020, our main trademarks include “FLOS”, “Louis Poulsen”, “B&B Italia”,
“Arclinea”, and “Maxalto”, which are recorded among the intangible fixed assets in the Group
balance sheet with a total value of 568.8 million. Such trademark is considered an asset with
indefinite useful life and, accordingly, is not amortized and is subject to periodical impairment
tests.

We cannot assure you that an adverse development in our business activities will not require us
to recognize impairment charges to write-off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill
and tradenames. A write-off of all or a part of our goodwill and tradenames would adversely
affect our consolidated net income and capitalization. Furthermore, if we were to recognize
substantial amounts of goodwill and tradename as a result of any future acquisitions, an adverse
development in any of these future acquisitions could require us in the future to recognize
impairment charges to write-off all or a part of the carrying amount of the goodwill and
tradename, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_If our advertising and promotional activities are not successful, our ability to market and sell our_**
**_products or develop new products may be harmed._**

A key element of our marketing strategy is to undertake advertising and promotional activities in
support of our brands, especially on social media, as well as in print publications featuring luxury
interiors or geared toward architects and designers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we
spent approximately €16 million on marketing and public relations expenses, representing 3.0%
of our total revenue for the same period. There can be no assurance that such advertising and
promotional activities will be successful, will target customers in our core markets or will be
relevant to the markets for high-end designer furnishings and lighting. In addition, we undertake
direct advertising and promotional activities, namely the creation of display materials for our
third-party distributors, catalogues and display materials for trade fairs and exhibitions. There
can be no assurance that our advertising and promotional activities will be successful in
promoting and maintaining awareness, and continued spend on these activities without a
resulting increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_If we are unable to protect our license and other intellectual property rights from others, or if_**
**_counterfeiting increases, our business may suffer, and we may incur significant additional costs._**

We rely on unfair competition, design, patent, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
rights to certain aspects of our products, including product designs, product research, concepts,
product names and unregistered and registered trademarks. Certain of our iconic products may
be protected by means of copyright law; however, requirements that need to be met to obtain
copyright protection of industrial design products (e.g. certain creativity and artistic value
thresholds) are quite high and may differ from country to country; therefore, it could be difficult
for us to enforce such rights before obtaining a final judicial decision acknowledging that such
requirements have been satisfied.

In addition, the trademark and design registration procedures and the relevant requirements
vary from country to country and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that all of our trademark and
registered design applications (especially regarding restyling of classic products) will be granted
in each country. Moreover, unlike trademarks, design registrations may be renewed only for a
limited period of time, which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, registered
designs in the EU may only be renewed for up to 25 years. Some of our registrations are close to
expiring, and the protection of the shape of the products covered by any expired registrations
under copyright and unfair competition laws may be less effective.

The degree of protection offered by our various designs, patents, copyrights, trademarks and
service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or

65


-----

competitive advantages to us, and our pending applications for designs, patents, copyrights,
trademarks or service marks may not be granted. In addition, not all of our products are covered
by designs, patents or similar intellectual property protections. For example, Flos has not filed
trademarks covering all of its names of products and product lines and relies to a certain extent
on de facto trademarks. A number of Flos’ classic products could be protected under copyright
law; however, as copyrights are not subject to registration formalities under Italian law,
enforcing copyright protection is difficult and costly and available remedies are weak. Although
Louis Poulsen follows a policy of registering designs, trademarks and copyrights in its key
markets, namely the EU, Norway, the U.S., China and Japan, in certain jurisdictions it is difficult
or impossible to formalize such registrations and as a result enforcement may be challenging.
B&B has also not filed or registered trademarks covering the names of all of its products or
product lines, and certain other product names and product lines are only covered by de facto
trademarks, which requires B&B to prove continuous use on a non-local basis. Although certain
of B&B’s well-known designs have been registered, most products covered by B&B’s license
agreements with designers have not been registered, and no registrations are in place for
products that have been created internally.

We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights
will be adequate to prevent infringement of such rights by others, including through the
imitation of our products and the misappropriation of our brands or product names. If we are
unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be
diminished and our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, the actions we take to
protect our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our licensors may be inadequate to
prevent counterfeiting of our products. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary
rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or the member states of the EU. We may need to
resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in
any litigation or other legal proceedings to defend our intellectual property rights and such
proceedings may entail a material cost to us, or we may compromise or settle such claims for a
variety of reasons. An adverse determination in any dispute involving our intellectual property
rights could, among other things, (i) require us to grant licenses to, or obtain licenses from, third
parties; (ii) prevent us from manufacturing, selling, importing or promoting our products;
(iii) require us to discontinue use of a particular intellectual property right; (iv) subject us to
substantial liability; or (v) enable competitors to exploit intangible assets that are currently part
of our intellectual property rights. Given the popularity of our products, we believe there is a risk
that counterfeit products or other products infringing on our trademarks, designs or licenses will
continue to emerge, and this risk tends to be higher on e-commerce platforms. In order to
combat counterfeit goods, we have and may continue to be required to expend considerable
time and resources on monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights. Although we
have taken steps to detect and prevent further counterfeiting, we may not be able to detect or
prevent all instances of infringement and may lose our competitive position in the market before
we are able to do so. If the quality of counterfeit products is not representative of the quality of
our genuine products, further damage could be done to the reputation of our brands.

We may, from time to time, be subject to claims by third parties that products we sell infringe
upon their intellectual property rights. If we are found liable for any such infringement, we could
be required to pay substantial damages, destroy products or comply with injunctions against us
to prevent further infringement. In addition, such infringement claims could harm the perception
of our brands by our customers or otherwise harm or image or reputation. Any payments we may
be required to make and any injunctions with which we may be required to comply as a result of
such infringement actions, as well as any failure by us to protect or enforce our intellectual
property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

**_If we experience labor disputes or work stoppages, our business could be materially adversely_**
**_affected._**

As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that 21% of our employees belonged to trade unions.
There can be no assurance that there will not be any strikes in the future, such as in connection
with any potential new acquisitions and any associated reorganization efforts. Any work
stoppages resulting from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level
of customer service. In addition, we may become party to labor disputes with certain of our
employees, including in connection with termination of their employment relations with us, and
from time to time we may carry out collective dismissals. Such collective dismissals may result in
disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to pay
additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims. Any disputes with our employees
or work stoppages resulting from strikes or other labor action could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In Italy, dismissals
for economic reasons are generally prohibited until June 30, 2021 due to the COVID-19
pandemic, pursuant to Italian Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020 (Legge di Bilancio 2021) and
Italian Law Decree No. 41 of March 22, 2021 (Decreto Sostegni). All workers performing their
activity in Italian territory are covered by mandatory social security insurance. This system is
financed by contributions from employees and employers, calculated as a percentage of the
employee’s gross remuneration. These contributions represent a relatively high surcharge on
labor costs. Also, in Italy, national insurance contributions to INAIL (the National Institute for
Accidents at Work), which covers all professional risks, are mandatory. In addition to these social
security measures, employers must set aside in their financial statements (or pay into
supplementary pension funds) a mandatory severance payment (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto or
TFR), which is deferred remuneration equal to 1/13.5 of any remuneration paid to the employees
in connection with the employment relationship. Further changes in any of the above-mentioned
laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations, including in
connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could substantially increase our operating
costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We rely on certification by industry standard-setting bodies and applicable law, including the_**
**_Made in Italy designation._**

We estimate that for the year ended December 31, 2020, a large portion of Flos’ and B&B’s
products carried the Made in Italy designation. The use of the Made in Italy designation is
regulated by Italian and EU law and requires that the relevant product be entirely produced in
Italy or undergo its “last substantial transformation” in Italy, which has been interpreted to
include assembly from semi-finished products manufactured elsewhere. We believe that the
Made in Italy designation represents a mark of quality and a differentiator of high value-added
products, therefore serving as a competitive advantage for our products carrying the Made in
Italy designation as compared to the products of our competitors and across our other
collections. If the laws regarding the use of the Made in Italy designation were to become
more restrictive in a way that is adverse to our interests, our sales may suffer, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

From time to time, we have been party as defendant or plaintiff in various legal proceedings
incidental to the ordinary course of our business. The results of pending or future legal
proceedings are inherently difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will not
incur losses in connection with current or future civil, administrative or employment suits or
other types of judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings that exceed any provision we
have set aside in our financial statements or that exceed any insurance coverage available. As of
December 31, 2020, we had set aside provisions relating to pending legal proceedings of
€2.9 million. For more information on existing proceedings, see “Business—Common Factors

67


-----

_Across Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen—Legal Disputes and Administrative Proceedings”. We may_
also inherit existing litigation or other legal proceedings from the companies that we acquire
from time to time. For example, we have been informed that YDesign was recently served with a
class action complaint from one former employee, acting as named plaintiff on behalf of the
plaintiff and any other similarly aggrieved current and former hourly or non-exempt employees
of YDesign during the past four years, seeking recovery under the Labor Code Private Attorneys
General Act of 2004 for alleged violations by YDesign of certain provisions of the California Labor
Code. These allegations include, among others, failure to pay overtime wages, full meal/rest
period premiums, full minimum wage, failure to reimburse necessary business-related expenses
and costs as well as unlawful business practices, on account of the foregoing, allegedly resulting
in unfair advantage. The foregoing claim is at the initial stage and its outcome, as well as any
potential economic liability arising therefrom, cannot be predicted as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, although we do not believe that any outcome of this claim may have a material
adverse effect on our financial conditions or results of operations. YDesign believes the claim is
without merit and, accordingly, currently intends to dispute these allegations.

In addition, even if a legal claim (of any nature) is without merit, does not prevail or is not
pursued, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against our business or products could
adversely affect our reputation. Regardless of its final outcome, litigation may also result in
substantial costs and expenses we would have to incur to defend ourselves, divert the attention
of our management or cause an interruption of our normal business operations, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results._**
We are subject to taxes in Italy, Denmark, the U.S. and numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Our
future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or
changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse
effect on our profitability.

We are also regularly subject to the examination of our income tax returns and other taxes from
the Italian and Danish tax authorities, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the governing tax
authorities in other countries where we operate. From time to time, we are involved in
discussions or disputes with tax authorities regarding our tax liabilities, which may lead to a
revision of our tax liabilities, and therefore affect our financial position. Tax audits and
investigations may generate negative publicity, which could harm our relationships with
customers, suppliers and other counterparties. Additionally, if such tax audits, investigations or
challenges result in decisions that are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay settlement
amounts, fees and penalties, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any such audits,
investigations or challenges, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require
that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves. We routinely assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from any such proceedings to determine the adequacy
of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes of any current ongoing
or possible future examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in tax laws or their interpretation or the unfavorable outcome of any future tax audits_**
**_or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, business and_**
**_financial position._**
Tax laws are complex and subject to subjective evaluations and interpretive decisions, and we are
and will continue to be periodically subject to tax audits aimed at assessing our compliance with
direct and indirect taxes. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws and regulations, including
those relating to the flow of funds among our subsidiaries pursuant to, for example, loan
agreements. Adverse developments in laws or regulations, or any change in position by the tax

68


-----

authorities regarding the application, administration or interpretation of laws or regulations, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on
our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

In addition, tax authorities may not agree with our interpretations of, or with the positions we
have taken or intend to take on, tax laws applicable to our ordinary activities and any
extraordinary transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness,
including the Notes, existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of
interest expenses. If tax authorities disagree with or object to our interpretations of tax laws, we
could face lengthy tax proceedings that could result in the payment of higher taxes, interest,
penalties or sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, business
and financial condition and on our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes
and our other indebtedness.

We may also inadvertently or for reasons beyond our control, including as a result of changes in
the way tax authorities or courts interpret tax law requirements, fail to comply with certain tax
laws or regulations, such as those requiring that retail sale of tangible personal property and
certain services be subject to sales tax, unless an exemption applies, or that taxes be paid in
certain states or regions where we do not have a physical presence as a result of sales we make in
such states or regions, any of which might result in additional tax costs and potentially sanctions
or other tax related liabilities.

There can be no assurance that the financial impact of any future audit or investigation or
adverse tax adjustment in connection with our business would not have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on our
ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In
addition, tax audits and investigations may generate negative publicity which could harm our
reputation with customers, suppliers and counterparties.

**_We may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products_**
**_we sell._**
Some of the products we sell or have manufactured may expose us to product liability claims and
litigation or regulatory action relating to personal injury, death or environmental or property
damage. Some of our agreements with our suppliers and international manufacturers may not
indemnify us from product liability for a particular supplier’s or international manufacturer’s
products, or our suppliers or international manufacturers may not have sufficient resources or
insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. Although we maintain liability
insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred
or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.

Moreover, we have been in the past and might be required in the future to replace defective
products as part of individual customers’ requests or as part of public recalls, or otherwise
intervene to assist customers if one of our products were to be defective, including after several
years of use. Although we have not incurred any material losses in connection with these events,
we cannot exclude that the occurrence of any such event could adversely affect the perception of
our brand in our markets or otherwise result in the incurrence of material expenses.

**_Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety, building permit, zoning and_**
**_town planning laws and regulations, compliance with which can require significant costs and_**
**_expose us to potential environmental liabilities._**
We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and foreign
environmental health and safety (“EHS”) laws that govern our facilities, operations and products.
Such regulations include those governing the manufacture, handling, transport, storage, use,
emission, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous wastes and materials,
wastewater discharges, noise emissions, human health and safety, process safety and risk
management. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability without regard to
fault on responsible parties, including current and former owners and operators of sites, related
to cleaning up sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released.

69


-----

Various current and likely future environmental laws could regulate the emission of greenhouse
gases, particularly carbon dioxide. We cannot predict the impact that such regulation may have,
or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business.

Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these
permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities and are
frequently issued subject to conditions requiring the implementation of improvement works at
the relevant sites. Typically, our permits require ongoing compliance with certain conditions in
order to maintain the applicable permit. Our permits may include requirements and conditions
which have not yet been finally determined, and which could result in significant additional costs
or environmental obligations for us. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, ongoing
capital and operating expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future EHS laws and
regulations.

In addition, our facilities are subject to building permits, zoning and town planning laws and
regulations providing for civil, administrative and criminal responsibilities in case of
non-compliance. Moreover, our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory
authorities to assess compliance with the applicable regulations. If we were to violate the
applicable regulations, we could be fined, and the competent regulator could impose a complete
shutdown of the non-compliant manufacturing facility. Failure to comply with EHS laws and
regulations could result in severe fines and penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal
sanctions, remediation or restoration requirements, claims for personal injury or property
damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the
suspension of, our operating permits or activities. Although we believe that EHS laws and
regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance
that future events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws or the discovery of
currently unknown environmental conditions, would not require us to incur substantial
additional costs to ensure our continued regulatory compliance, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our insurance coverage could prove inadequate._**

We have taken out comprehensive insurance policies in relation to a number of risks associated
with our business activities. However, our insurance coverage is subject to common exclusions,
limits and deductibles. Given the diversity of locations and settings in which our employees
provide services and the range of our activities, we are not able to foresee accurately all relevant
activities and situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our
insurance policies. As a result, we may incur losses or be subject to claims that exceed the type,
scope or amount of our existing insurance coverage. At the same time, we have identified several
risks that cannot be insured on economically feasible terms and for which, therefore, we have
chosen not to purchase insurance cover. These risks include, for example, some risks related to
disruptions or breaches of our IT infrastructure.

If one or more claims exceed, in the aggregate, a certain amount in a given calendar year, insurers
may increase the insurance premiums or the terms and conditions of our insurance coverage may
become less favorable than at present. Our insurance costs may also increase over time in response
to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the
insurance market in general. There is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to obtain
sufficient insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, recent turmoil
and volatility in the global financial markets, as well as the ongoing effects of the COVID-19
outbreak, may adversely affect the insurance market. This may result in some of the insurers in our
insurance portfolio failing and being unable to pay their share of claims as well as in an increase in
the insurance costs. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to
_continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and_
_other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”. The realization of_
any of these risks and any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to credit risk related to some of our customers which may cause us to make_**
**_larger allowances for doubtful trade receivables or incur write-offs related to doubtful debts._**

As of December 31, 2020, we had €57.1 million in trade receivables from customers, excluding
€5.7 million of bad debt provision. Although we review the credit risk related to our customers
regularly, such risk may be exacerbated by events or circumstances that are inherently difficult to
anticipate or control, including, among other reasons, an economic weakness in our customers’
industry or the financial insolvency of their business or a general deterioration of the global
economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While certain customers, depending
on the sales channel, are required to pay us in advance, many customers pay their receivables
within 60 to 120 days and there can be no assurance that we will not experience an increase in
late payments. Although our €5.7 million provisions for doubtful debts as of December 31, 2020
represented 10% of our trade receivables, we cannot guarantee that this provision will be
sufficient. The amount of our provision for doubtful debts is based on our assessment of
historical collection trends, business and economic conditions and other collection indicators.
However, there can be no assurance that bad debts associated with delinquent payment or
non-payment by our customers will not increase, also due to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic. Furthermore, in the event that these customers are unable to timely pay the amounts
due to us, we may need to implement certain specific debt management plans which, while
allowing our customers to continue their operations, may entail a reduction or deferral of the
payments due to us. If the macroeconomic conditions in our core markets deteriorate, we cannot
assure you that we will not have to increase our provisions for doubtful debts relating to trade
receivables, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and
_is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations_
_and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar_
_impact”._

##### Risks Related to our Financial Information

**_The pro forma financial information of the Issuer relating to the year ended December 31, 2018_**
**_included herein has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or_**
**_experts, is subject to management estimates and should not be relied upon in isolation when_**
**_making an investment decision._**

The Issuer is a holding company which was incorporated on September 10, 2018 for the purpose of
the initial acquisition by the Issuer of each of Flos, B&B and Danish Holdco (collectively, the “Original
**Acquisition”). Therefore, the audited profit and loss statement of the Issuer for the period ended**
December 31, 2018 presented herein only reflects approximately one month of activity of the Group
starting from the completion of the Original Acquisition on November 22, 2018.

For purposes of facilitating the comparison of our results of operations among the periods under
review, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” section of this Offering Memorandum presents certain selected pro forma profit and_
loss data in respect of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2018 (collectively, the “2018
**Pro Forma Information”). For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis**
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to_
_the year ended December 31, 2018”. The 2018 Pro Forma Information gives pro forma effect to_
the Original Acquisition, as well as all the transactions related thereto, including, inter alia, the
equity contribution by the Sponsors to the Issuer, the issuance of the Existing Notes by the Issuer
and the refinancing of certain previously existing indebtedness of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo,
as if all such events had occurred on January 1, 2018.

The 2018 Pro Forma Information has been prepared by management for illustrative purposes
only. Neither our independent auditors or any other independent auditors or consultants have
audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the 2018 Pro Forma
Information for the purpose of its inclusion herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly,
neither our independent auditors or any other independent auditors have expressed an opinion

71


-----

or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering
Memorandum. Moreover, the 2018 Pro Forma Information has not been prepared and shall not
be construed to be in compliance with Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act or the
Prospectus Regulation or any other regulations or the SEC or any other regulator.

For these reasons, the 2018 Pro Forma Information should not be relied upon in isolation when
making an investment decision and investors should exercise caution when comparing our results
of operations between periods under review.

**_The consolidated financial information of YDesign presented herein, including as part of our Pro_**
**_Forma Synergized EBITDA, was prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP and is therefore not_**
**_comparable with the consolidated financial information of the Issuer, which was prepared on_**
**_the basis of IFRS._**
On April 12, 2021, the Issuer, together with U.S. BidCo and U.S. MergerCo, entered into the
Acquisition Agreement with YDesign and the Seller Representative providing for the acquisition
of YDesign by the Group, as further described under “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Acquisition”. This Offering Memorandum includes certain selected consolidated financial_
information of YDesign as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and, under
“Summary—Recent Developments—Current Trading for the Three Months Ending March 31,
_2021 and Current Outlook”, the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, including the net sales_
and the Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign, the latter of which is converted from U.S. dollars to euro
and added to our Synergized EBITDA to calculate our Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA. The
Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign is presented in this Offering Memorandum for illustrative purposes
because, when added to our Synergized EBITDA to calculate our Pro Form Synergized EBITDA, we
believe it provides a useful measure of the combined results of operations of the Issuer and
YDesign as if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020 (or April 1, 2020, as applicable).
However, the Adjusted EBITDA or any other financial data of YDesign are unaudited, have not
been otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts, and have been derived from
YDesign financial statements and management accounts, which are prepared on the basis of U.S.
GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA of YDesign and any other financial data of YDesign presented
herein are therefore not comparable with the Adjusted EBITDA and other consolidated financial
information of the Issuer presented herein, which are derived from underlying financial measures
prepared in accordance with IFRS. As a result, these financial measures are inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties, may differ materially from our actual results and should not be unduly
relied upon when making an investment decision.

**_Our_** **_Synergized_** **_EBITDA_** **_and_** **_Pro_** **_Forma_** **_Synergized_** **_EBITDA_** **_presented_** **_in_** **_this_** **_Offering_**
**_Memorandum are based upon management estimates and assumptions in respect of certain cost_**
**_savings and revenue synergies. Such estimates and assumptions might prove to be materially_**
**_incorrect as a result of factors that are beyond our control and are subject to known and_**
**_unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors._**
Our Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum
have not been subject to audit or review by our auditors, consultants or experts and the
adjustments and assumptions that have been used to prepare it may prove to be inaccurate or may
be affected by other factors that have not been accounted for. Each of Synergized EBITDA and Pro
Forma Synergized EBITDA is based on a number of assumptions and estimates, including estimates
with respect to certain cost savings and revenue synergies, some of which we expect to generate
following the Transactions from initiatives that have not been initiated as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum (see “—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to fully realize
_the Group’s commercial and strategic vision”). These estimated savings and synergies are forward-_
looking by nature and therefore subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution
and costs associated with implementing the underlying initiatives. Such assumptions are inherently
uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition factors which are
difficult to predict and some of which are beyond our control, including:

- the success of our D-Studio stores openings and of the launch of our new direct e-commerce
platform;

72


-----

- our ability to jointly operate the Target Group’s business with our business and our ability to
successfully continue the coordination process in respect of our other subsidiaries following the
Original Acquisition;

- our ability to re-negotiate contracts with the Target Group’s agents, distributors, suppliers and
other relevant parties;

- potential claims and litigation that might be initiated by our or YDesign Group’s workforce or
the unions to which our or YDesign Group’s workforce belongs in connection with personnel
rationalization initiatives; and

- other risk factors identified in this Offering Memorandum.

Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate Synergized
EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such
assumptions will turn out to be correct. In addition, the effects of these initiatives may be offset
by deterioration in the markets in which the Group operates, increases in other expenses or
unrelated challenges in the business. As a result, the amount of cost savings and revenue
synergies that we will actually realize, if any, and the timing of any such realization may differ
significantly from (and may be significantly lower or occur later than) the ones that we currently
estimate and have presented herein. In addition, the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost
savings initiatives, revenue synergies and other benefits described herein may be substantially
higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit.

Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA and the underlying calculations were not
prepared with a view to compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
published by any other regulatory or industry body regarding estimates, and therefore have not
been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Each of
Synergized EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergized EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum
because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what the results of the Group may be
upon the completion of certain cost saving and revenue synergy initiatives following the
Transactions; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance
under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider any of
this information as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in
accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. If any of our
assumptions or estimates prove to be materially incorrect, we may not generate sufficient cash
flow to redeem the principal of and pay interest on the Notes.

**_Our order intake is based upon management estimates and it is subject to unexpected_**
**_adjustments and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of future earnings._**
In the section “Summary—Recent Developments—Current Trading for the Three Months Ending
_March 31, 2021 and Current Outlook”, we also present certain unaudited financial information in_
respect of our order intake. We cannot be certain that our order intake will generate the
expected revenue or cash flows or generate them when we expect. Unforeseen events or
circumstances, including, for example, termination or scaling down of contracts, increased time
requirements to complete the relevant project, delays in commencing the project or other
disruptions and potential litigation associated with the projects to which our order intake refers
or other unforeseen events (including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us or our
customers) may affect projects in our order intake and could negatively impact our results of
operation and financial position. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances
or subject to certain penalties or other consequences, to cancel, reduce or defer firm orders that
we include in our order intake. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that orders may be canceled
or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets,
including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurances that the revenue that
we expect to receive from our order intake will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. In
addition, our definition of order intake may not necessarily be the same as that used by other
companies engaged in activities similar to ours. As a result, the amount of our order intake may
not be comparable to the order intake or other

73


-----

similar metrics reported by such other companies. Moreover, the change of our order intake
between two reference periods is not calculated on a constant currency basis and therefore
reflects the impact of the relevant currency exchange rates trends, thereby affecting the
comparability of this metric between such two periods.

##### Risks Related to the Transactions

**_The Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, which, if not fulfilled or if not fulfilled in a_**
**_timely manner, may result in termination of the Acquisition Agreement._**
On April 12, 2021, the Issuer, together with U.S. BidCo and U.S. MergerCo, entered into the
Acquisition Agreement with YDesign and the Seller Representative providing for the acquisition
of YDesign by the Group (the “Acquisition”), as further described under “Summary—The
_Transactions—The Acquisition”. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the respective_
obligations of YDesign and U.S. BidCo to consummate the Acquistion are subject to, among other
things, the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

- the absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the completion of the Acquistion;

- the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Antitrust Laws, such
as the HSR Act;

- the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties under the Acquistion
Agreement, subject to customary materiality standards; and

- compliance, in all material respects, of the other party with its covenants under the Acquistion
Agreement.

The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, or having to make significant changes to the
structure, terms or conditions of the Acquisition to obtain any required regulatory approvals,
could delay the completion of the Acquisition by a significant period of time, increase the costs
associated with completing the Acquisition or prevent the Acquisition from occurring. Any delay
in completing the Acquisition could cause the parties to not realize some or all of the benefits
that are expected to be achieved if the Acquisition is successfully completed within the expected
timeframe. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the Acquisition will
be satisfied or waived, and if satisfied or waived, when they will be satisfied or waived. The
Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights of YDesign and U.S. BidCo, including
the right of each party to terminate if the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition
Agreement have not been consummated prior to or on October 12, 2021.

**_The Acquisition is subject to the receipt of governmental clearance that may impose conditions_**
**_that could have an adverse effect on the parties or, if not obtained, could prevent_**
**_consummation of the Acquisition._**
The consummation of the Acquisition is conditioned upon clearance under the HSR Act. Although
each party has agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such clearance,
there can be no assurance that such clearance will be obtained and that the other conditions to
consummating the Merger will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which
such clearance is required may impose conditions on the consummation of the Acquisition or
require changes to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement or other agreements to be entered
into in connection with the Acquisition Agreement. Such conditions or changes and the process
of obtaining regulatory clearances could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation
of the Acquisition or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company
following consummation of the Acquisition, any of which might have an adverse effect on the
combined company’s, as applicable, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, this offering may take place before all governmental clearances have been obtained
and, in cases where such clearances have not been obtained, before the terms of any conditions
to obtain such clearances that may be imposed are known. As a result, the parties to the
Acquisition Agreement may make decisions after the completion of this offering to waive a

74


-----

condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary clearances without seeking
further consent of holders of the Notes. Such actions could have an adverse effect on the
combined company’s business, financial condition and results of operations following the
Acquisition.

**_Until completion of the Acquisition, the Issuer will not obtain control of the Target._**

The Target is currently owned by the Pre-Closing Target Holders and the Issuer will not obtain
control of the Target until completion of the Acquisition. Even though the Acquisition
Agreement provides for interim operating covenants that require YDesign to obtain the consent
of U.S. BidCo prior to taking certain actions, the Pre-Closing Target Holders may not operate the
business of the Target during the interim period in the same way that the Issuer would.
Furthermore, the Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time
and focus from management of the Target, which could adversely affect their ability to operate
the Target’s business. Likewise, other employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition or
feel otherwise affected by it, which could have an impact on work quality and retention.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target will not be subject to the covenants
described in “Description of Notes”. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the
Target will not take an action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had
such covenants been applicable, including dividends, incurrence of debt or liens, asset disposals,
acquisitions or investments.

**_If certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be_**
**_required to redeem a portion of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you_**
**_expect on the Notes._**

The Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit
€150.0 million of gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account pending
the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of our control. If the Acquisition
does not occur on or prior to November 20, 2021 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”) or if certain
other events that trigger escrow termination occur, the Issuer will be required to redeem Notes
with an aggregate issue price equal to €150.0 million at a redemption price equal to the issue
price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to but excluding such
special mandatory redemption date and additional amounts, if any (with the redeemed Notes to
be selected pro rata for redemption from all of the Notes) pursuant to a special mandatory
redemption, as described in “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”, and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes. The_
escrowed funds will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is
equal to the issue price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to but
excluding such special mandatory redemption date and additional amounts, if any. In addition,
negative interest may accrue on the sums deposited in the Escrow Account. The Issuer would
therefore be required to contribute to the Escrow Account an amount necessary to pay the
special mandatory redemption price on the special mandatory redemption date. We cannot
guarantee you that the Issuer, which is a holding company with no material operations of its
own, will have sufficient funds at the required time to make these payments.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders_**
**_of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement. However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended (including, without
limitation, with respect to the Target Management Reinvestment) and the closing conditions may
be waived at any time by the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes.
Furthermore, any amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may make the Acquisition
less attractive. Any amendment made to the Acquisition Agreement may be materially adverse to
holders of the Notes, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on the return the holders expect
to receive on the Notes.

75


-----

**_The Acquisition may entitle the Target Group’s customers or other business partners of the_**
**_Target Group to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**
The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the
Target or its subsidiary, in which case, following the consummation of the Acquisition, the
counterparties to such agreements may be entitled to terminate their agreements with the
Target or its subsidiary. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights,
which could have an adverse effect on the Target’s financial position and results of operations.

##### Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our_**
**_business, financial position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our_**
**_obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**
We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations which will increase
following the issuance of the Notes. As of December 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to
the Transactions, we would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the
amount of €921.6 million, including €470.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
and €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes, and excluding
€100.0 million available for drawing under our Revolving Credit Facility. We anticipate that we
will continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization”,
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes”.

Our high leverage could have important consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not
limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Existing
Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payments in respect of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and/or the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases to the extent that our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and
increasing the cost of any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes.

Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be
affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors.

Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet
our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or to
dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We cannot assure you that refinancing or

76


-----

asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be
permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and_**
**_depends exclusively on cash from its operating companies, including, following the Acquisition,_**
**_the Target Group._**
The Issuer is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no
significant assets other than the shares it holds in its subsidiaries, the intercompany receivables
under the I/C Loans and, following the Completion Date, the shares it will hold in the Target
through U.S. BidCo and the intercompany receivables under the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan
(together with the I/C Loans, the “Intercompany Loans”). The Issuer is, and will continue to be
following the Transactions, dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the
form of dividends, principal repayments or interest payments under the Intercompany Loans or
other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes,
as we do not intend to merge the Issuer and any of its subsidiaries.

Given the Group’s international operations, the Group has a large number of operating
subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our results. The amounts
of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash
flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under
applicable law or otherwise transfer funds directly or indirectly to the Issuer. The Issuer’s
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make
distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of its
indebtedness, including the Notes.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability
of these subsidiaries to move cash to the Issuer. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation in the form of withholding tax or other taxes pursuant to the laws
of the jurisdiction of the relevant subsidiary and/or Italy, which is the jurisdiction of the Issuer.
Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay
as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or prevent such payments. In particular, the
ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the
amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when
due. In addition, the aggregate amount of the I/C Loans is, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, €308.3 million, and the aggregate amount of the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan is
currently expected to be approximately $72.2 million, which amounts in aggregate are
significantly lower than the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes and the Existing Notes,
and we expect the Intercompany Loans to yield interest broadly in line with the interest accruing
under the Notes or the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable. Accordingly, the ability of the
Issuer to make payments under the Notes will largely depend on the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Issuer, which will be subject to
the risks described above and could be inefficient from a tax perspective.

The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make
payments with respect to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees. While the Indenture limits the
ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends
or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications
and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may be unable to raise the financing that we require or refinance our existing debt,_**
**_including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, both of which mature_**
**_prior to the Notes._**
We primarily use, and have used in the past, debt issuances and shareholder funding, together
with cash flows from operations, to finance our operations. Any delay in obtaining, or a failure
to obtain, adequate financing (including suitable terms on which the banks or other lenders may
agree to lend) may impair our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, including
maintenance capital expenditures.

77


-----

Furthermore, certain of our debt matures prior to the Notes. For example, in November 2018, we
entered into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement for the provision of a €100.0 million
revolving credit facility which matures on May 15, 2025. For details of the maturity profile of our
indebtedness, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. In addition, the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes will mature on November 15, 2025, which is also prior to the maturity date of
the Notes offered hereby. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or
obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to sell assets, or raise
additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial or holders of our debt
may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. If the
Issuer and its subsidiaries are not able to refinance any of their debt, obtain additional financing
or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its
obligations with respect to its debt, including the Notes. Any delay in refinancing, or the inability
to refinance on commercially acceptable terms, debt falling due in accordance with the maturity
schedule of our indebtedness may result in an acceleration of such debt, and enforcement over
our assets, including in particular any collateral granted as security in support of such debt,
including our properties. If we are unable to refinance our debt when due, we may not be able
to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**
Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We may
borrow up to €100.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which is, or will be, secured by
the same collateral as the Collateral for the Notes and the Existing Notes and may in the future
be secured over certain other assets, and each of the Indenture and the Existing Indenture also
permits the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indenture, the Existing Indenture and
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of
indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that
shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the
Notes, and any such indebtedness could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture, the
Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain or will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness, including
secured indebtedness, that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions is substantial.
If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that
we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement do not or will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to
fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**
The Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain
covenants which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements
limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

78


-----

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants”. The covenants to which we are subject could limit
our ability to operate our business, to finance our future operations and capital needs and to
pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain
affirmative covenants while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore,
under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a
financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement”. Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility_
may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such
financial ratio. Failure to satisfy the financial ratio shall not directly or indirectly constitute, or
result in a default or event of default, and shall solely result in a draw stop for any new
utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the foregoing, a breach of any of the
covenants or restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could result in an event
of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of
default that is continuing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to the
applicable cure period, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit
Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility,
together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the
Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of
acceleration of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture and the Existing
Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility or the
holders of the Existing Indenture, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure
you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to
make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure
repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations,_**
**_which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes and the Existing Notes, or to
refinance our debt and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our
future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the
success of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors”,
many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our
debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the
repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility or the
redemption of the Existing Notes at their maturity. At the maturity of each of the Revolving
Credit Facility (May 15, 2025), the Existing Notes (November 15, 2025), the Notes or any other
debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we

79


-----

do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations as they fall due, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See also “—We may be unable
_to raise the financing that we require or refinance our existing debt, including the Revolving_
_Credit Facility and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, which mature prior to the Notes”._

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital
raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial
markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on
a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets
to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes or the Existing Notes on a timely basis would likely
result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing
Notes, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future debt
may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no
assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold,
the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.
If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our
obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in:

- our debt holders, including holders of the Existing Notes, declaring all outstanding principal
and interest to be due and payable;

- the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their
commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and

- our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your
investment in the Notes.

**_The Notes, drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and any future variable interest rate_**
**_debt we incur in the future will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**
After giving effect to the offering of the Notes and the Refinancing, a large portion of our debt,
including the Notes, will continue to bear interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to
the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. The Notes will bear variable rate based on the Euro
Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), plus an applicable margin, and the Revolving Credit Facility
bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (and,
if applicable, CIBOR, NIBOR or STIBOR), plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments
on the Notes. Neither the Indenture nor the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a
covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a
portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to

80


-----

pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent
interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase,
thus reducing cash flow.

In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it intended to stop
compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, on
March 5, 2021, the FCA announced the dates on which panel bank submissions for all LIBOR
settings will cease, after which representative LIBOR rates will cease be available, which are
immediately after the December 31, 2021, publication in the case of all GBP, EUR, Swiss franc and
Japanese yen settings and the 1-week and 2-month USD settings, and immediately after the
June 30, 2023, publication in the case of all remaining USD settings. The cessation of LIBOR will
result in the rate of interest in respect of LIBOR-linked borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility being determined as set out in the facility documentation, which may result in such
borrowings being subject to a rate of interest that is materially different from that which would
have produced by LIBOR over an equivalent period. This could have an adverse impact on our
ability to service our debt. We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased
variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments, however
future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and
we may incur significant associated costs. No mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions
would be triggered under the Revolving Credit Facility when LIBOR ceases to be available.

Additionally, the European Money Markets Institute (“EMMI”, the admininstrator of EUIBOR)
announced in 2020 that measures needed to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform
EURIBOR to ensure continued publication and compliance with E.U. Benchmarks Regulation, such
regulation having been implemented into EU law in order to address perceived weaknesses in
the admininstration of benchmarks and entering into force on June 30, 2016 (subject to certain
transitional provisions). EMMI has subsequently confirmed that it is compliant with the E.U.
Benchmarks Regulation. However, there can be no guarantee that subsequent changes in
regulatory guidance, industry standards or market practice could result in further changes to way
in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or EURIBOR replacement rates or mechanisms or other risk-free rates
are drafted, implemented or interpreted. In addition, the potential elimination of any other
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators
or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or other
benchmarks are determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or
result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not
limited to the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change could have an adverse
impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Hedging arrangements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**
**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**
We may enter into interest hedging arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, in light of
the fact that the consideration for the Acquisition will be in U.S. dollars whereas the portion of
gross proceeds from the Notes which will be deposited into the Escrow Account pending closing
of the Acquisition will be in euro, we may enter into hedging arrangements to hedge the
associated exchange rate risk. We may also enter currency hedging arrangements in respect of
our international operations and our indebtedness, including the Notes, the Existing Notes and
the Revolving Credit Facility. Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to the credit risks
of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have
under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition,
in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we
may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

##### Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral

**_The Issuer, Design Holding, the Guarantors and any other provider of Collateral will have control_**
**_over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the_**
**_Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, Design Holding, the
Guarantors and any other Collateral providers, as applicable, to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the
Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has
occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, Design Holding, the Guarantor and any
other Collateral providers, as applicable, may, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and
making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these
activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to
you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens on
the Collateral.

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Issuer is indirectly controlled by funds advised by Investindustrial and Carlyle. As a result, the
Sponsors jointly have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as
well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. The
Sponsors’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For
example, the Sponsors could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
Sponsors have entered into a shareholders’ agreement that provides for the governance rules of,
_inter alia, Design Holding and its subsidiaries. All significant actions to be taken by the Group will_
require approval of the board of directors of Design Holding, which approval must include the
favorable vote of at least one director designated by Carlyle and one by Investindustrial. If a
matter is not approved by the board of directors due to a deadlock that is not solved through the
procedure set forth in the shareholders’ agreement, the relevant resolution shall not be adopted.
As a result, even when your interests are aligned with the interests of one of the Sponsors, the
other Sponsor may disagree and be entitled to vote against a decision that would be in your
interest. Any such deadlock, if not promptly resolved, could adversely affect our business.
Moreover, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire
and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and/or that operate in
our markets or adjacent ones. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are
complementary to or in competition with our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, the Sponsors may hold interests in suppliers
or customers of the Issuer and its subsidiaries. The Sponsors and their respective affiliates could
also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures (including one or more divestitures of
all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our
shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks
to you as a holder of Notes.

**_The Notes will be secured by the Escrow Charge on the Issue Date, and the Issuer is only_**
**_required to grant the Notes Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral within certain_**
**_time periods following the Issue Date or Completion Date, as applicable. Certain of the_**
**_Collateral may not secure the Notes if the Acquisition does not occur and may not secure the_**
**_Notes until up to 90 days from the Completion Date if the Acquisition occurs._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by
the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 20
Business Days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial

82


-----

Guarantors (as defined herein). Within 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by the U.S. Guarantors. The Guarantors also guarantee or will
guarantee, as applicable, on a senior basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.
However, in application of the Agreed Security Principles, subsidiaries of the Issuer that may be
required in the future to provide a guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility, might not be
able to guarantee the Notes. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
_maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “—The_
_Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not, or_
_do not become, Guarantors or to the liabilities of Guarantors to the extent that such liabilities_
_exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantors”._
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such additional Notes
Guarantees within the time periods specified. The Notes Guarantees will be limited as set forth in
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Escrow Charge. In
addition, subject to certain agreed security principles and certain significant limitations pursuant
to applicable laws, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis, within five Business Days
from the Issue Date, by the Initial Collateral, within 20 Business Days from the Issue Date, by the
Post Issue Date Collateral and, within 90 days from the Completion Date, by the Post Completion
Date Collateral. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such
security interests within the time periods specified. Security interests over the Post Completion
Date Collateral will not be granted at all if the Acquisition does not occur. The Collateral also
secures or will secure, as applicable, on a first-ranking basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any). The security interests in the Collateral will
be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and
enforceability, as set forth under “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”, which limitations_
could be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
_and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._

If a guarantee or a security interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or
perfected after the secured obligation arose, such guarantee or security interest may be subject
to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws. See “Certain Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency_
_Law Considerations”._

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future liabilities of the Issuer’s_**
**_subsidiaries that are not, or do not become, Guarantors or to the liabilities of Guarantors to the_**
**_extent that such liabilities exceed the principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or_**
**_secured by such Guarantors._**
Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if
any) of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer are entitled to payments of their claims from the
assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their
respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes (including
the Guarantors). Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as
part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes, will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other
disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or

83


-----

indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors,
including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries of the Issuer. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the subsidiaries of the
Issuer which are not expected to guarantee the Notes represented 34.4% of the consolidated
revenue of the Issuer, 24.8% of the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and 8.3% of the
consolidated total assets of the Issuer. As of December 31, 2020, the Guarantors (excluding
YDesign and U.S. BidCo) had €18.5 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party
indebtedness, none of which was secured and €15.0 million of which was represented by lease
obligations under IFRS 16, and all of which is expected to remain in place following the
Transactions.

As of December 31, 2020, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not expected to guarantee the
Notes had €32.9 million in aggregate principal amount of external third-party indebtedness,
none of which was secured and €31.9 million of which was represented by lease obligations
under IFRS 16, and all of which is expected to remain in place following the Transactions. In
addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit the guarantors and
non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence
constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The
Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and
trade payables in the ordinary course of business, that may be incurred by non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

Moreover, the Notes Guarantees are subject to the significant limitations described under
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and, accordingly, the Notes will be structurally_
subordinated to the liabilities of the Guarantors to the extent that such liabilities exceed the
principal amount of Notes that can be guaranteed or secured by such Guarantors. See
“—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_**
**_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**
**_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Flos and B&B are incorporated and organized under the laws of Italy, Louis Poulsen A/S and
Danish HoldCo are incorporated and organized under the laws of Denmark, Antares is
incorporated and organized under the laws of Spain and U.S. Bidco and the Target are
incorporated and organized under the laws of Delaware, United States of America. Enforcement
of the obligations under a Notes Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as
applicable, any such Guarantor or security provider will be subject to certain defenses available
to the Issuer or the relevant guarantor or the security provider, as the case may be. These laws
and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance,
corporate interest or benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance, voidable preferences,
thin capitalization or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally, by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Notes Guarantee and
Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security
provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such
Notes Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate
interests, or the burden of such Notes Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant
guarantor or security provider, or such Notes Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of
capital maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any
other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary guarantor or

84


-----

security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An
increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Notes Guarantee without a
corresponding increase in the amount of the Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Notes
Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Accordingly, enforcement of any such Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be
subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations
contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory
requirements applicable to the relevant guarantors. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its
Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable
to it.

It is possible that a Guarantor or creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of
a bankruptcy of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s
Notes Guarantee on any of the above grounds and the applicable court may determine that the
Notes Guarantee should be limited, surbordinated or voided. To the extent that agreed
limitations on the Notes Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would to that extent be
structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of
such Guarantor. Future Notes Guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. See “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_**
**_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity_**
**_and enforceability._**
Each Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. The obligations of the Guarantors, the enforcement of each of their Notes
Guarantees and the obligations of the grantors of security and the ability of the Security Agent
to enforce on the Collateral will be limited under the Indenture to the maximum amount that
can be guaranteed by such Guarantor or provided by the grantor of security under the applicable
laws of Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States of America, which has been determined so as
to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws related to, among others,
corporate interest or benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or
transactions under value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under
applicable law or such Notes Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause
the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law
for providing such Notes Guarantee.

In particular, enforcement of any Notes Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor
or grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some
cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Notes Guarantees or creation of security
designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant
Guarantors or grantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent
conveyances or transfers, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, voidable preferences, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar laws and regulation or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. As a result, the liability of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or of a grantor of
security could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the amounts of its other
obligations and the law applicable to it.

_Italian law limitations_

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others,
financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
the Existing Indenture, the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the

85


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, each Notes Guarantee and security interest granted by each of Flos and
B&B (the “Italian Guarantors”) will be limited as follows:

(i) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by each of the Italian Guarantors will
only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the relevant Tranche of the Notes
and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any
intercompany loans (including (i) with respect to Flos, the Flos I/C Loan, and (ii) with respect
to B&B, the B&BI/C Loan advanced from time to time to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by
the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following 22 November 2018, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case
net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received
upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided
further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in
excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made
by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee;

(ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Flos, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the
Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time,
by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount
of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as
defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the
Notes;

(iii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by B&B, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the
Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time,
by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount
of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as
defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the
Notes;

(iv) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an
Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a
principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or
secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that time;

(v) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the
Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests
(including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantors under
its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as
usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code
and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively;
and

(vi) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the
relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest by:

a. Flos does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or

86


-----

payment obligations under Tranche B (each as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under
the Notes; and

b. B&B does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or
payment obligations under Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the
Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at
identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition
debt” and/or refinancing indebtedness in relation to “acquisition debt” in respect of,
respectively, Flos and B&B and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian
financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is
untested in Italian courts and it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and
separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’
proceeds to be utilized to refinance the portion of the Existing Floating Rate Notes that has been
utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of,
respectively, Flos and B&B. Should the Notes Guarantees and/or the security interests granted by
Flos and/or B&B, respectively, be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any
provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the
Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or security interests, could be declared null and
void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee
would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358
and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the relevant Italian Guarantor,
such Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Notes Guarantee
shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than
Design Holding, Flos and B&B) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be
subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth
in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security
documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to
comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and
financial assistance.

In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may
be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security
grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests
granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding
amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or
secured creditor pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Indenture and/
or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect
to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or
any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the
abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by
an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security
provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any agreement regulating future
_pari_ _passu_ indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security
documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall
not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the
transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from
any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian
Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s
credit support as described above.

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed
amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of

87


-----

the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the
holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes
Guarantees and security granted by such Italian Guarantors. See “Certain Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is
issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future
obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount
should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is
deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the
guarantee could be declared void.

_Danish law limitations_

The Danish Companies Act (selskabsloven) contains restrictions on upstream guarantees and
security by Danish limited companies. Generally, Danish companies and their Danish and
non-Danish subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans to and/or issuing guarantees or
providing security in respect of obligations of, among others, their direct and indirect parent
companies. However, Danish companies may grant loans to and/or issue guarantees or provide
security in respect of obligations of parent companies covered by Danish Executive Order No. 85
of January 30, 2020, which applies to any entity in the corporate form of (a) a public limited
company (aktieselskab), (b) a limited partnership company (partnerselskab), (c) a private limited
liability company (anpartsselskab) or (d) a company with an equivalent corporate form,
incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU (such as the Issuer, which is a joint
stock company incorporated in Italy) or European Economic Area or Switzerland, Australia,
Canada, Chile, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea,
New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or the U.S. In addition, a Danish company is generally
prohibited from granting loans and/or issue guarantees and/or provide security in connection
with the financing (or refinancing) of the acquisition by any person or entity of shares in such
Danish company or shares in its (direct and indirect) parent companies, and any such loan,
guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable.

Further, Danish law requires guarantors or security providers to obtain an adequate corporate
benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. The directors or, as the case may
be, the managers of the company are obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual
interests, including by, among other things, taking into consideration the company’s financial
position, the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of
guarantees and security, assessment of the Issuer and the other Guarantors and security
providers, and by ensuring that the relevant guarantee or security arrangement is on market
terms. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors or, as the case may be, the managers of a
Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil liability and the guarantee and/or
security may be deemed invalid. It is not clear under Danish case law under which circumstances
corporate benefit accrues to a subsidiary guaranteeing and securing debt of a direct or indirect
parent company or other group company.

Given the aforementioned limitations under Danish law with respect to Danish financial
assistance and corporate benefit, and with a view to minimizing the risk of being challenged or
set aside, the Notes Guarantees and security to be granted by a Danish Guarantor or security
provider: (i) (other than Danish HoldCo) will not apply to any part of the Notes being used to
refinance the portion of the Existing Notes that was used to refinance the DKK 750 million
(€100.5 million) senior creditor facilities that were incurred by Luminous Designs Denmark ApS to
finance the acquisition of LP in August 2018 (the “LP Senior Facilities”) (as further described
below), in order for such Notes Guarantees and security to comply with Danish statutory
provisions on unlawful financial assistance; and (ii) shall in respect of upstream (and, if

88


-----

applicable, cross-stream) guarantees not exceed, among other things, a maximum equivalent to
the greater of the equity (egenkapital) of the relevant Danish Guarantor or security provider
(calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) (i) at the time of the granting
of the Notes Guarantees or Collateral, as applicable or (ii) at the time payment is requested
pursuant to the Notes Guarantees or Collateral is enforces, as applicable, in order for such Notes
Guarantees and security to comply with the above corporate benefit concerns.

The aforementioned limitations and respective compliance with Danish financial assistance and
corporate benefit rules are untested in Danish courts. Accordingly, if a Notes Guarantee or
security provided by a Danish company were to be challenged before a Danish court, we cannot
assure that such court will deem the Notes Guarantee or security valid and enforceable. See
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

To the extent that any such debt constituting unlawful financial assistance cannot be separated
from other debt, such other debt may be deemed unlawful financial assistance debt and any
loans, guarantees or security granted by Danish companies for such other debt may then also be
invalid or unenforceable. The LP Senior Facilities were incurred by Luminous Designs Denmark
ApS to finance the acquisition of LP in August 2018. On April 6, 2021, Luminous Designs Denmark
ApS, as the non-surviving entity, was merged with and into Danish HoldCo, as the surviving
entity. As a result of the merger, Luminous Designs Denmark ApS was dissolved and Danish
HoldCo, by operation of the Danish law principle of universal succession, assumed all of the
assets and liabilities of Luminous Designs Denmark ApS. The LP Senior Facilities were refinanced
in 2018 with a portion of the Existing Notes, part of which will be refinanced with the proceeds
of the Offering. LP and its subsidiaries will not be able to guarantee or provide security for the
part of the Notes that will be used to refinance the portion of the Existing Notes that was used
to refinance the LP Senior Facilities in 2018. Given that the Danish Companies Act does not
include any detailed provision on the segregation of acquisition debt from other debt for the
purpose of determining whether financial assistance has in fact been provided, the beneficiary,
upon enforcement, may be required to evidence that enforcement proceeds are in fact applied in
accordance with the Danish restrictions on financial assistance. Furthermore, according to the
Danish Business Authority, the prohibition on financial assistance also extends to non-Danish
subsidiaries of Danish companies. If loans, guarantees or security are granted in violation of the
prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees or security will be invalid and unenforceable and must
be repaid with statutory interests. The directors may be subject to liability for losses suffered in
this regard.

_Spanish law limitations_

As a result of the applicable limitations under Spanish law with respect to, amongst others,
financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, each Notes Guarantee, Collateral and security
interest granted by Antares or any Spanish company will not guarantee those obligations or
liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance
laws in accordance with Articles 143.2 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act. In particular,
Antares will not guarantee the acquisition of, or the subscription for the shares or quota shares
of, its parent company (sociedad dominante); however, it will be allowed (provided it continues
being a public limited liability company (sociedad anónima)) to guarantee the acquisition of, or
the subscription for the shares or quota shares of any other company (different from its parent
company (sociedad dominante)) belonging to its group and any other not of its group. For the
purposes of Antares as a Guarantor of the Notes, the Indenture will include the above-mentioned
limitations regarding financial assistance.

In addition, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure
another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant
guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, guarantee or security interests follow the
underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the

89


-----

guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the
guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers incorporated in Spain are able to
prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may
consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or in respect of
the relevant security provided are not enforceable.

Additionally, pursuant to Spanish applicable legislation:

- The concept of a first demand guarantee is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code
(Código Civil) but it has been treated under Spanish case law as an autonomous guarantee
detached from the underlying agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed. Therefore,
Spanish case law acknowledges the validity of the provision pursuant to which the guarantor
has agreed not to call on exceptions different from those arising from the guarantee.
Nevertheless, Spanish case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations,
the guarantor invokes against the beneficiary of the guarantee the exception of fraud, bad
faith or abuse of right in the events where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a
fraudulent manner or with bad faith.

- The laws of Spain may limit the ability of any Spanish guarantor to guarantee debt of a related
company or grant security on account of a related company’s debts. These limitations arise
from the interpretations of various provisions and from certain general principles of corporate
law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks
associated with a guarantee or the granting of security to guarantee or secure a parent or
sister company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from
the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective. If these limitations were not observed, the guarantees
or security granted by any Spanish guarantor could be subject to legal challenge.

See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

_Other limitations pursuant to bankruptcy or insolvency laws_
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law
and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations
under its Notes Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid
under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of that
Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court
found that:

- the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one
creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant
Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the relevant Notes Guarantee has
the effect of giving a creditor a preference or the creditor was aware that the relevant
Guarantor was insolvent when the relevant Notes Guarantee was granted;

- the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee or the relevant Guarantor was: (i) insolvent
or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant
Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the relevant
Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law.

It is possible that a Guarantor or a grantor of security, or a creditor of a Guarantor or a grantor
of security, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or a grantor of

90


-----

security, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee or
grantor’s creation of security on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable
court may determine that the Notes Guarantee or the relevant security interest should be limited
or voided. To the extent such limitations on the Notes Guarantee or security obligation apply, the
Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or grantor,
including trade payables of such Guarantor or grantor to the extent of such limitations. Future
pledges or guarantees may be subject to similar limitations.

Additionally, the grant of Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the grantor or by an
insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may otherwise
be set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if
the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been
given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally
specified “clawback” period following the grant. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the relevant security interest.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are
given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect to the claims
of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations”._

As a general rule under Danish law, the insolvent company or any creditor of such company may
present a petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied
that the debtor is insolvent and that the insolvency is not temporary based on an assessment of
the debtor’s liquidity status. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is
adequately protected in the vent of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security.
The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of
the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some extent modified by the rules governing
priority of debts in bankruptcy. The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Bankruptcy Act
(konkursloven) and it indicates the order in which claims against the estate or the debtor are
settled. After the fulfilment, if any, of these priority-ranking claims, any exceeds proceeds will be
distributed among all ordinary unsecured creditors. Interest accrued on ordinary claims will rank
as ordinary claims up the declaration of bankruptcy, after which date the accrued interest will
rank as a deferred claim. Deferred claims further include, among others, subordinated loans and
penalties. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

With respect to Spanish Law, the Spanish Insolvency Act (as defined herein) imposes a
moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor’s rights (in rem security) with security over
rights or assets which are considered as necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s
professional or business activities in the event of insolvency, with certain exceptions (such as
financial collateral, as defined under Royal Decree Law 5/2005), of March 11, as amended from
time to time). The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency until
the earlier of (i) the elapsing of one year from the declaration of the insolvency without the
liquidation phase being initiated or (ii) approval of a creditors’ composition agreement (convenio
_de acreedores). Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of the declaration of insolvency_
the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when
the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the asset is not necessary for the
continuance of the debtor’s professional or business activities. When it comes to determining
which assets of the debtor are necessary for the continuance of its professional or business
activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of
the debtor’s assets. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another
company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing
provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset
necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security

interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about an early
termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of
the relevant asset. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations_**
**_and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be_**
**_repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from
enforcement of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the
Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is
required to apply turned over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions towards discharging certain super senior obligations (including, among
others, those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future
indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in
priority to applying any such amounts towards discharging the Notes and the Existing Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes will be secured on a first ranking basis with security interests
over the Collateral that also secure, or will secure, our obligations under the Existing Notes,
Super Senior Liabilities and to certain hedging counterparties and certain other permitted future
indebtedness. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in
the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the
holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so in
accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If either (i) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or
Existing Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with
the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the
“Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior
Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) or (ii) the
creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that
time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall
deliver those instructions to the Security Agent and the other agents, trustees and hedge
counterparties.

The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors and/or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, in each case subject to the
consultation period of 15 days as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement; however, (i) if and to
the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in
cash within six months of the end of the consultation period or (ii) the Security Agent has not
commenced any enforcement action within three months of the end of the consultation period
or (iii) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a debtor or Holdco (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action at
that time with respect to such debtor or Holdco, then the Security Agent will act in accordance
with the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. No consultation
shall be required (and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to take any enforcement
action prior to the end of the consultation period, where: (a) any of the Collateral has become
enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting a debtor or Holdco; or (b) if the Majority

92


-----

Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith (and
notifies each other representative agent of the other creditors party to the Intercreditor
Agreement) that any delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to reduce
the amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full or
to have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect an enforcement or a distressed disposal
and, in each case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the
interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors on behalf of
which the relevant instructing group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with
the instructions first received.

In the event that conflicting instructions (and, for these purposes, failure to give instructions is
deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received by the end of the consultation period (and
have not been resolved), the Security Agent shall take any enforcement action in accordance
with the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, with such instructions to
comply in each case with the security enforcement principles contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement and the terms of all instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors
during the consultation period shall be deemed revoked.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has
been indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) that it may in its discretion
require by a member of the Senior Secured Group for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur
in complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the
Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted
commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities or the Existing Notes may have interests that are
different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time
when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the
Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result
of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the
Notes Guarantee and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the
Notes Guarantee may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens”._

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except
through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes,
you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders
of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the guarantors of the
Notes in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted_**
**_as security for the Notes and other secured indebtedness may be secured by assets that do not_**
**_secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of
_Notes—Security”. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer_
and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred with
certain property and assets that do not secure the Notes. If an event of default occurs and the
obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees thereof will not
benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of
other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any

93


-----

property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. The claims of secured
creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with
respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders
of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, the Issuer and its
subsidiaries had no indebtedness secured by assets that will not secure the Notes.

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional Notes Guarantees and
grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of granting
liens in favor of other indebtedness or the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries
or otherwise, such obligations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications pursuant to the
Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles set forth in the Indenture set out a
number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or Notes
Guarantee in certain circumstances. The operation of such Agreed Security Principles may result
in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, such Agreed
Security Principles may affect the value of the security or Notes Guarantee provided by the Issuer
and any Guarantor.

In particular, even though the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are
expected to share the same Collateral and Guarantees, this may not always continue to be the
case and circumstances may arise in the future in which lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be granted the benefit of additional security or guarantees which are not otherwise
permitted to be granted in favor of holders of the Notes due to the application of the Agreed
Security Principles and, ultimately, Italian, Danish and Spanish financial assistance and corporate
benefit rules. Accordingly, in such circumstances holders of the Notes would have no direct claim
for payment against any such additional guarantor nor any rights as a secured party with respect
to any such additional collateral.

**_The principal amount of the receivables forming part of the Collateral may be reduced as a_**
**_result of prepayments of such loan prior to the maturity date of the Notes._**
The Issuer has entered into, or will enter into and/or amend, as applicable, the I/C Loans and the
U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan, the intercompany receivables from which will constitute part of the
Collateral. Repayments of the I/C Loans and/or the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan prior to the maturity
date of the Notes would result in a reduction in the liability owed by the relevant subsidiaries to
the Issuer. The I/C Loans documentation (but not the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan documentation),
however, will prohibit the repayment, reduction, extinguishment or equitization of such I/C
Loans, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of Certain Financing Agreements—Existing
_Proceeds Loans”. Any reduction in the principal amount of the I/C Loans and/or the U.S. BidCo_
Proceeds Loan would reduce the value of such receivable, the Notes Guarantees and the
Collateral.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**
If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of
the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event
of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the
sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations
with respect to the Notes. The Collateral provided as security for the Notes, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, will be limited to liens granted over certain assets including the shares of the
Issuer and the relevant subsidiaries, certain intercompany structural loans within the Group and
certain material bank accounts of the Issuer. See “Description of Notes—Security”. Trade
receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property or other assets of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value
of the Collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of the
assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will

94


-----

also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold
as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets
in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the
availability of buyers.

The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide
for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid
and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that
the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the
liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be
prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby
decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents,
enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise
be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be
obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations
may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will
not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to
cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our
subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in such entity.

As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover
anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may
decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on
the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and
any Guarantor’s remaining assets.

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens on the Collateral other than those in
favor of the holders of the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or
third parties are secured by liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the
Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies
with respect to such assets which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our
obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders
of such Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered
hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The Collateral and the Notes Guarantees will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances,_**
**_liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement,_**
**_whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions,_**
**_defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the_**
**_Collateral and the Notes Guarantees, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or_**
**_foreclose on such Collateral and the Notes Guarantees. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of_**
**_security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of_**
**_perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The_**
**_granting of the Notes Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the_**
**_Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or_**
**_voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain_**
**_jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Notes Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create
hardening, clawback, voidance or preference periods for such Notes Guarantees and security
interests in certain jurisdictions, including Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States. The
granting of shared security interests, including in connection with any release and retake of such

95


-----

security interest, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness (such as hedging obligations or
any additional notes issued under the Indenture) or the transfer or the assignment of the security
interest may restart or reopen hardening, clawback or preference periods in certain jurisdictions,
including Italy, Denmark, Spain and the United States. The applicable hardening, clawback,
voidance or preference period for these new security interests (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Collateral granted to secure the Notes) can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted, perfected, amended, confirmed and/or confirmed and extended,
shared or recreated (as applicable). At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated or
confirmed and/or extended were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or
voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, Danish law, Spanish law and U.S.
law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) are released and
retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a
new hardening or preference period in respect of such security interests. Under certain
circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts could
challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations”._

The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in
several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock
or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations”. In Italy,
Denmark, Spain and the United States, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may
give rise to new hardening or preference periods in respect of the relevant security interests in
the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in
the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph.

Similar considerations also apply following the Completion Date in connection with the accession
of further subsidiaries as additional guarantors of the Notes and the granting of security interest
over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as
applicable.

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date
the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the
Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under applicable law. The
Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of
security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third
party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such
consents. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets,
and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, because the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the security interests in the Collateral will be
governed by the laws of a number of different jurisdictions, respective realization and
enforcement may be further delayed by court proceedings being taken in multiple jurisdictions.

**_The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be_**
**_complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate._**

In connection with the enforcement of share pledges over shares of entities with outstanding
debt obligations, any sale of such entities is likely to involve a release of some or all of the debt
of such entity, which could result in a taxable capital gain to such entities. As the Notes will be
issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement
over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Indenture does
not prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the

96


-----

enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s
debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to
reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the
value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may be limited.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Notes Guarantees thereof or the_**
**_Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy. Flos and B&B are also incorporated under the
laws of Italy, Louis Poulsen A/S and Danish HoldCo are incorporated under the laws of Denmark,
Antares is incorporated under the laws of Spain and U.S. Bidco and the Target are incorporated
under the laws of Delaware (United States of America). The Collateral includes the shares of
certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions and certain present
and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in
respect of debtors in these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or
a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in either of these jurisdictions. Your rights under
the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to
effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional
nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer
and any Guarantor that is not incorporated in the United States may be materially different
from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas
of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postpetition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these
laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the
laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your
rights under the Notes Guarantee and the security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral
securing the Notes give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on
and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and
the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of
such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to
avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on such Collateral.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus
the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to,
any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By
accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these
restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event
of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the
Collateral are taken, including Italian, Danish and Spanish and U.S. law, as applicable. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged
assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There
is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial

97


-----

owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a
security document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in
the courts of certain jurisdictions (including the Republic of Italy and Spain). In certain
jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent
(“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor owed to holders of
the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”), but
in jurisdictions such as Italy and Spain, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable
provided Italian and Spanish case law has not ruled for its application. All or part of the pledges
and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security
interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations (except for
cases such as Spain where the Principal Obligations would be secured). Under the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security
interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk
of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in
financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under
law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, Danish law and Spanish law, and
to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt
construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security
interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but
will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as
representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of
November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly
created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be
entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights
before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees.
However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and
enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article
2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of
the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein
or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings,
the security interests created under the security documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of
Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of
transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”).
A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after
the Offering.

Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are
given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims
of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations”._

98


-----

In Spain, the concept of “parallel debt” is not recognized under Spanish law and guarantees/
security interests require the beneficiary of the guarantee/ security interests and the creditor to
be the same person, thus implying that any guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third
party who does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security
interests for the parties that do. In particular, in Spain, the Collateral will be granted directly to
the holders of the Notes represented and acting through the Security Agent which also acts in its
capacity as representative (en nombre y representación) of the holders of the Notes and thus
being the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or security interests granted in respect to
the obligations derived from the Notes. For the enforcement of any security interest in Spain by
the Security Agent, it will be necessary (i) that each of the secured parties benefiting from such
Collateral proves its title to the secured obligations, ratifies such Collateral and accepts the
benefit of the security interest in its respective name and (ii) to prove that the Security Agent is
duly and expressly empowered by means of duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor
of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors, if necessary, with the Apostille of
The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could be a delay in the
enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers and the
relevant public deeds are granted. In the absence of the notarized and apostilled powers of
attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce the relevant Collateral or security
interests in Spain on behalf of the holders of the Notes, and there is a risk that the Security
Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it individually
holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security
Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security who have not accepted the security or
have not duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security
Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an
insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors. Further, there is a risk that the relevant court or
notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may eventually be enforced might
request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and
the notarization of each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every
transfer of the Notes. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

The enforcement of the Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law, located in Denmark
or governed by Danish law and located in Spain or governed by Spanish law is subject to
mandatory provisions of Italian law, Danish law and Spanish law, as applicable, including in
relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security
Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

As regards the security documents governed by Danish law, the Security Agent’s ability to hold
the relevant security interests on behalf of the holders of the Notes require that the Security
Agent is registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet) in accordance
with the rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act (kapitalmarkedsloven). No
assurance can be given that the Security Agent or the terms and conditions of the Notes and
other documents meet the eligibility criteria for the Security Agent to be registered with the
Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that such registration will be obtained or, if obtained,
that it will be maintained.

In case of insolvency of any Guarantor, the enforcement of any collateral provided by such
Guarantor may be subject to certain restrictions. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations”._

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured
party or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes

99


-----

may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or
are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any
security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest, the
holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s right in the Collateral or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same
Collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on the ability of the holders of the Notes to
receive proceeds from any enforcement of the Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will
not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the
perfection of, any such liens.

As a matter of Danish law, it is, inter alia, a perfection requirement that bank accounts and the
cash flow from assigned intercompany loans are controlled by the Security Agent (i.e. by
effectively blocking the pledgor from making any withdrawal from the bank account without the
specific consent of the Security Agent and by only allowing payment of the intercompany loan to
the Security Agent (or a third party so designated by the Security Agent)). Absent such
perfection, the holder of the security interest will be unable to enforce its rights in the secured
assets in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors
who claim a security interest in the same assets. Furthermore, if the Security Agent gains control
of the cash flow at a later stage, the security interest in such assets will be subject to the voidance
rules of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, which among other things, include a general three-month
hardening period from the day the Security Agent assumes control of the cash flow.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee_**
**_or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**
Pursuant to the Indenture, under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will
be released automatically, including a sale or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction
that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture, as applicable, and in connection
with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will also
permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Notes as
unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes
of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Notes
Guarantee of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain
conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of
the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted
subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_The Issuer may amend the economic terms and conditions of the Notes without the prior_**
**_consent of all noteholders with the vote of either 75% or 50% of the aggregate principal_**
**_amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be._**
The Indenture will contain provisions for calling meetings of the holders of the Notes to consider
matters affecting their interests generally. As set forth in “Description of Notes—Meeting of
_Holders of Notes”, the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of_
holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case
may be. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of
the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be,
including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of
Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the
Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the
rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change
the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to
change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements
relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change

100


-----

the amendment provisions. These and other changes may adversely impact rights of holders of
Notes and may have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes.

Under Italian law, the approval of an extraordinary resolution typically requires the consent of
more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Our decision to
increase the majority requirement is untested under Italian law, may be challenged by holders of
the Notes, the Issuer and others, and if challenged, may not be upheld by an Italian court, with
the consequence that the majority voting threshold may be reduced from 75% to 50%.
Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each
holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions
relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is
also largely untested in the Italian courts.

**_The insolvency laws of Italy, Denmark, Spain and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as_**
**_favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction_**
**_with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the security_**
**_interests in the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their_**
**_validity and enforceability._**
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy and certain Guarantors are incorporated under
the laws of other European Union Member States, such as Antares which is incorporated in Spain.
There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in Regulation
(EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency
Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) is the jurisdiction where a company’s registered office
is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares of the Issuer and
certain subsidiaries that are incorporated under the laws of Italy, Denmark, Spain and Delaware
(United States of America), as applicable, and pledges of certain present and future
intercompany loan receivables. While Denmark and Delaware are not bound by or otherwise
subject to the application of the Insolvency Regulation, the rebuttable presumption operated by
the Insolvency Regulation is applicable in Italy and Spain, where it is also established under Royal
Legislative Decree 1/2020 approving the consolidated text of the Insolvency Law, as amended
(the “Spanish Insolvency Act”).

The insolvency laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Italy, Denmark and Spain, may not be as
favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you
are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could
be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions,
which are untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory
provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which
may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may
be familiar with).

Danish HoldCo and Louis Poulsen A/S are companies incorporated under the laws of Denmark.
Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect to Danish HoldCo and its Danish
subsidiaries may proceed under, and be governed by, the insolvency laws of Denmark. These laws
may adversely affect the enforcement of your rights under the Notes and may not be as
favorable to your interests as a creditor as the laws of other jurisdictions.

In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the
creditors based on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the
creditors as a reorganization and sale of a going concern. As a general rule, the debtor or any
creditor may present a petition for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be

101


-----

satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a statement of the debtor’s liquidity status. A
bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of
the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. If bankruptcy proceedings are
commenced, payments under the Notes may be delayed and may not be made in full. Provisions
on avoidance and set off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Notes.

Danish insolvency law also includes a scheme for reconstruction (rekonstruktion) of insolvent
companies. In broad terms, this scheme provides for reconstruction of an insolvent company by
transfer of the business in full or in part, by a compulsory composition/moratorium or by a
combination of both. During the reconstruction procedure, creditors are restricted in their ability
to enforce the claims, however valid security may be enforced under certain conditions. In
general, the provisions on avoidance and set off applicable in a bankruptcy also applies when
reconstruction proceedings are commenced.

In addition, Antares is incorporated under the laws of Spain and, accordingly, any insolvency
proceedings with respect to it may proceed under, and be governed by, the laws of Spain. The
insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of the
United States or some other jurisdictions, and certain provisions of Spanish insolvency law could
affect the ranking of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees or claims relating to the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees (including enforcement claims) on an insolvency of Antares, as the case may
be.

As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the
Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes
against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the
enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may
also void the security interest or the Notes Guarantees if the company is close to or near
insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law,
although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined
under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees and the security interests, and
intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it
makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or
the security interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes
Guarantee or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security
provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Notes Guarantee or security interest
is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is
otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider
under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result
in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.

102


-----

The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security
Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court
would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the
possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the
entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws,
_capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles,
courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Notes Guarantees were issued or
the security interests created, the Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Notes Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors
over others (and, in certain jurisdictions, even if the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or
the collateral provider was insolvent when it granted the Notes Guarantee or security interest),
or created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Notes Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent
business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have
contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of
the Notes Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made;

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Notes
Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Notes Guarantee or security interest were
incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or
on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the
Notes Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for
other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which
the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur,
or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when
they would become due;

- the Notes Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to
the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or

- the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security
provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a
Notes Guarantee or created any security interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that we and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining
whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Notes Guarantees
were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation,
a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or
that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider
was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created,
that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security
interests granted to secure the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or by other creditors under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Italian
Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of
transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”).
The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one
year prior to the declaration of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset
or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one-quarter the value of the consideration
received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or
security taken after the creation of the secured obligations, whereby the creditor must prove its
lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any clawback
action, (ii) security granted in order to secure a debt due and payable, whereby the creditor must
prove his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the relevant entity in order to rebut any
clawback action during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the
insolvency, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or
security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect
period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, whereby the insolvency
administrator must prove that the creditor was aware of the state of insolvency of the relevant
entity in order to enforce any clawback action. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of
_the Guarantee and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations” for further_
information.

Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions without consideration are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration. In addition, under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of
receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective
vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency. In
addition, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various
national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU.

If challenged successfully, the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and
any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of
any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security
interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents.

Under Spanish law the granting of security is subject to the two-year applicable clawback regime
in the case of an insolvency. Therefore, the insolvency trustee or receiver could challenge those
transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” (perjudiciales) to the insolvent
debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy
declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent (in accordance with Article 238 of the
Spanish Insolvency Act, transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are
subject to the ordinary regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code).

In order to seek protection against claw-back, refinancing agreements (out-of-court workouts)
may be judicially sanctioned (homologados) by the commercial court that will be competent to
conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding in compliance with the provisions of the Spanish
Insolvency Act.

Finally, as a consequence of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in Spain,
the Spanish Government has enacted a series of extraordinary legislative instruments which
contain certain temporary provisions with effects on the general insolvency regime.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Notes
Guarantees and security interests, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Our right to receive payments under the I/C Loans may be subordinated by law to the_**
**_obligations of other creditors._**
Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for
rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in
respect thereof.

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly,
directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing
company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same
person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a
_responsabilità limitata, such loan will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and_
rank senior only to the equity in that borrower if the loan is made when, taking into account the
kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s
indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation
requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to Article 2467
of the Italian Civil Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within
one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower.

The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude
that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support
provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized
above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies
to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the Italian borrowers under
the relevant I/C Loans (i.e. Flos and B&B).

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, it
cannot be excluded that a court may find the requirements provided for by the relevant
provisions of the Italian Civil Code to be applicable in respect of the Flos I/C Loan and/or the B&B
I/C Loan borrowed by, respectively, Flos and B&B. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that
Flos’ and/or B&B’s obligations under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B I/C Loan are
subordinated to all their obligations to other creditors. Should any of Flos’ and/or B&B’s
obligations under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B I/C Loan be deemed subordinated
to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the
Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under, respectively, the Flos I/C Loan and the B&B
I/C Loan to the relevant subsidiary, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s
ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any
obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by
operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created
over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interest granted by such
Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantees provided by B&B and Flos) may be impaired or
restricted. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**
Because the Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold
in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the
obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United
States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Prospective U.S.
_Investors”._

105


-----

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**
The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as defined below) will trade in book entry form only,
and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be
issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book
entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes
representing the Notes.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes
representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear
and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold
book entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants
to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have
any responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear
and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own
their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other
actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be
permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear
and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be
sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book
entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**
The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including the liquidity of the
market for the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors,
including general economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and
prospects, as well as third-party recommendations. Historically, the market for non-investment
grade securities has from time to time been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes and may be adversely affected by a
general decline in the market for similar securities. In addition, the trading market for the Notes
may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. The
Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. However,
they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue such market-making at any time without
notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop
or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained, and any disruption in the trading market for

106


-----

the Notes may have a negative effect on your investment regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
Notes at fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the LuxSE
and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will
be or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of
the admission to trading on the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for listing or the
delisting of the Notes (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock
exchange), as applicable, from the Official List of the LuxSE may have a material effect on a
holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**
In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of Notes—
_Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such
proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the
Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**
The Issuer and a number of the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United
States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and a number of the Guarantors are non-residents of, and
substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Issuer and
the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any
action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and those Guarantors organized or
incorporated outside the United States. In addition, as a majority of the assets of the Issuer and
their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are and will be located
outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce U.S. court judgments against them.
Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of non-U.S. jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of U.S. courts obtained against the Issuer and the directors and executive officers
who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S.
federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such non-U.S. jurisdictions
against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal and state securities laws. For further
information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an_**
**_asset sale offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to_**
**_purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not_**
**_consent to the tender._**
If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an
offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of
the Notes that are tendered under any such offer and may need to obtain financing to pay for
the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable
terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a similar offer under the Existing Indenture
and a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and agreements
governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any
failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a
default under the Indenture.

107


-----

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations,
restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may
adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the
Indenture. Moreover, a change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if it constitutes a
“Specified Change of Control Event”. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event”.

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence
an asset sale offer, as defined under the Indenture, to all holders of the Notes pursuant to which
we will be obligated to offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset
_Sales”._

In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third party will also have the right to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price
offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption”.

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be_**
**_certain that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**
The definition of “change of control” and the paragraph “Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation
or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken
as a whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“all or substantially all”, it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies
according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial
interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in
ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially
all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has
occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Interest paid on the Notes may be treated as U.S. source interest, in which case, 30% U.S._**
**_withholding tax may apply unless a non-U.S. holder qualifies for an exemption from such_**
**_withholding tax._**
A substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering is expected to be on-lent by us to U.S.
BidCo and used in the United States to fund the Acquisition. As a result, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could argue that there is a potential tax avoidance plan and that
interest on the Notes paid to a non-U.S. holder is treated as U.S. source interest, which is subject
to withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) unless the non-U.S. holder qualifies
for an applicable exemption. We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect
to amounts so withheld. See “Taxation—Certain _United_ _States_ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_
_Considerations—Possible Alternative Tax Treatment of the Notes” for a discussion of these_
potential U.S. federal income tax consequences and of certain related acknowledgements,
representations and agreements that each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes will be
deemed to have made by its purchase and acceptance of the Notes.

**_You may face currency exchange risks or other consequences as a result of investing in the_**
**_Notes._**
The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in
the Notes will entail currency exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible

108


-----

significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic,
political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the
U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon
rates and could result in a loss to U.S. investors on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Notes by
U.S. investors may have significant tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or
losses, if any. See “Taxation—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_Italian tax legislation may restrict the deductibility of all or a portion of the interest expense on_**
**_our indebtedness, including interest expense in respect of the Notes._**

Current tax legislation in Italy (Article 96 of Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as
amended by Legislative Decree No. 142 of November 29, 2018) allows for the full tax deductibility
of interest expense incurred by a company in each fiscal year up to the amount of the interest
income of the same fiscal year, as evidenced by the relevant annual financial statements, and
interest income carried forward of the previous years. Excess interest income may be carried
forward without time limitation to allow deduction of interest expenses in following years. A
further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of
30% of the EBITDA of a company, modified with certain adjustments (risultato operativo lordo
_della gestione caratteristica) (“ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal_
years. The ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss
account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding
depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through
the application of the tax rules concerning the determination of the corporate income taxable
base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense in a fiscal
year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. Net interest expense not deducted
in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years without time limits,
provided that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income
of the same fiscal year and interest income carried forward from the previous years, is lower than
30% of ROL. If the tax group regime (consolidato fiscale) applies, interest expense not deducted
by an entity in the Italian tax group due to lack of ROL can be deducted at the tax unity level,
within the limit of the excess of interest income of the same fiscal year and interest income
carried forward from the previous years (if accrued after the inclusion in the Italian tax group)
and the excess of ROL of the same fiscal year and ROL carried forward of the previous five years
(if accrued after the inclusion in the Italian tax group) of the other Italian resident companies
belonging to the same tax group. Our ability to deduct interest expense in respect of the Notes
and other indebtedness incurred by companies within the Group will therefore depend on the
ROL and our ability to have tax group arrangements. Any delay in the effectiveness of a tax
group will impact the ability to deduct interest expense.

In addition, there can be no assurance that in case of a tax audit, the relevant tax authorities
would not try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with the
component of any financing used, in whole or in part, to refinance an outstanding loan, when
the terms and conditions of the refinancing transaction appear less favorable than the ones of
the previous financing transaction or to finance payments or distributions of dividends and/or
capital made to shareholders of the Issuer or otherwise. In particular, in such circumstances the
relevant tax authorities could argue that the interest expenses arising from such financing do not
relate to the business of the borrowing entity (as the relevant transaction is deemed as “antieconomic” and as such not compliant with the “business purpose” (inerenza) principle set out
under Italian tax law).

The Italian tax authorities have in certain instances challenged leveraged buyout (“LBO”)
transactions with respect to the deductibility of interest expenses arising in connection with
acquisition financing. On March 30, 2016, the Italian Revenue Agency issued Circular Letter n. 6/E
(the “Circular Letter”) clarifying, as a common principle, that interest on the acquisition bank
loan in LBO transactions is generally deductible for IRES purposes, subject only to ordinary
limitations stated in art. 96 Presidential Decree n.917 of December 22, 1986. In particular, the
Italian Revenue Agency confirmed that LBO transactions are grounded on sound economic

109


-----

reasons, as the aim to acquire control over the target company and its structure (including the
debt push down) is usually requested by third-party lenders. As a result of such guidance, LBO
transactions are generally not considered suspect for tax purposes absent specific circumstances
in which the tax authorities contend that the structuring of any such transaction was designed to
obtain unlawful tax advantages in violation of the law or established legal principles (e.g.
re-leveraged transactions without a change of control).

Any future changes in Italian tax laws or in their interpretation, including any future limitation
on the use of the ROL or the tax treatment of interest expense arising from any indebtedness,
including the Notes, the failure to satisfy the applicable legal requirements relating to the
deductibility of interest expense or the application by Italian tax authorities of certain existing
interpretations of Italian tax law (including as referred to in the Circular Letter) may result in our
inability to fully deduct our interest expense and application of withholding taxes, which may
have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Furthermore, if the Italian tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or
characterization of any of the transactions performed or of our previous or existing
indebtedness, including the Notes or the use of proceeds from the Offering, including on the
basis of anti-avoidance or anti-abusive criteria, we may be unable to fully deduct our interest
expenses or be subject to (i) significant penalties and accrued interest, (ii) the imposition of
withholding taxes or (iii) other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations or on our ability to service or otherwise make
payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness.

**_Investors in the Notes generally will not be entitled to a gross-up for any Italian withholding_**
**_taxes._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Italy and is Italian resident for tax purposes and
therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain
on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations.

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be made free and
clear of Italian withholding tax, unless the withholding tax is required by law. In that event,
subject to a number of exceptions, the Issuer may pay such additional amounts as will result in
the holders of the Notes receiving such amounts as they would have received in respect of such
Notes had no such withholding tax been required.

The Issuer is not liable to pay any Additional Amounts to holders of the Notes under certain
circumstances, including if any withholding tax is required pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
No. 239 of April 1, 1996 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time), and
any implementing regulations (“Decree No. 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
No. 461 of November 21, 1997 (as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to
time), and any implementing regulations (“Decree No. 461”), except where the procedures
prescribed by Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption have not
been complied with solely due to the Issuer’s (or its agents’) actions or omissions. In such
circumstances, where no additional amount are due, investors subject to Italian withholding tax
will only receive the net proceeds of their investment in the Notes.

Although we believe that, under current law, Italian deduction of tax should not be imposed
under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 where a beneficial owner of Notes is resident for tax
purposes in a country or territory which allows for a satisfactory exchange of information with
the Italian tax authorities as identified by (i) the Italian tax authorities in Italian Ministerial
Decree of September 4, 1996 as subsequently amended, supplemented and replaced or (ii) once
effective, in any other decree that will be issued in the future under Art. 11(4)(c) of Decree
No. 239 to provide the list of such countries (the “White List”), and such holder complies with
certain certification requirements, there is no assurance that this will be the case. Moreover,
holders of the Notes will bear the risk of any change in Decree No. 239 or in Decree No. 461 after
the date hereof, including any change in the White List.

110

**_No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes will satisfy the listing requirement of_**
**_Decree No. 239._**
No assurance can be given that the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the LuxSE and the
admission of the Notes to trading on the LuxSE’s Euro MTF Market will satisfy the listing
requirement of Decree No. 239 in order for the Notes to be eligible to benefit from the
provisions of such legislation relating to the exemption from the requirement to apply
withholding tax.

The Italian tax authorities issued an interpretive circular relating to, among others, the listing
requirement of the aforementioned legislation in order for the Notes to be eligible for the
exemption from deduction of tax. According to a strict interpretation of this circular, the Notes
may not be eligible to benefit from such provisions if the listing of the Notes is not effective as of
the Issue Date. In the event that the Notes are not listed as of the Issue Date or that such listing
requirement is not satisfied, payments of interest, premium and other income with respect to the
Notes would be subject to a withholding tax, currently at a rate of 26%, and, subject to certain
exceptions, see “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”, the Issuer would not be required to
pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding tax. We cannot assure you that the
Italian tax authorities will not interpret the applicable legislation as requiring that the listing be
effective upon issuance of the Notes and we cannot assure you that the listing can be achieved
by the Issue Date. The imposition of withholding taxes with respect to payments on the Notes
and the resulting obligation to pay, subject to certain exceptions, Additional Amounts to holders
of the Notes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_No assurance can be given that the procedural requirements to apply the Italian tax regime_**
**_provided by Decree No. 239 will be met._**
The regime provided by Decree No. 239, and in particular the exemption from withholding tax,
which is in principle granted to holders of the Notes who are the beneficial owners of the
proceeds from the Notes (or, if the Holders are institutional investors not subject to tax, as they
are identified in any case as the beneficial owners of the Notes, as clarified by the Italian tax
authorities in the Circular Letter No. 23 of March 1, 2002, par. 4) and who are resident in a
country included in the White List (or are established in a country included in the White List, in
case of Holders that are non-Italian institutional investors), applies if certain procedural
requirements are met. It is not possible to assure that the non-Italian resident investors can claim
the application of the withholding tax exemption where the relevant non-Italian intermediary
fails to comply with the procedural rules set for the application of the exemption regime or fails
to provide sufficient information to the relevant Italian tax authorities under the procedures set
for applying the exemption regime. See “Taxation—Certain Italian Tax Considerations”.

Should the procedural requirements not be met, Italian withholding tax may apply on the
payments made on the Notes to non-Italian investors resident in countries that allow for
satisfactory exchange of information with Italy. In such event, the Issuer will not be required to
pay any Additional Amounts with respect to such withholding tax.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**
If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or
more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, the Notes will be treated as issued with
original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, U.S. Holders,
whether on the cash or accrual method of tax accounting, would be required to include any
amounts representing OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield
to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments
to which such income is attributable. For further discussion, see “Taxation—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**
The Indenture will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject
to any of the provisions of the TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the
protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified
indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting
interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Notes”.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and
credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes.
The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely
affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade_**
**_ratings._**
The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes issued under
the Indenture receive an investment grade rating from each of Moody’s and S&P, and no default
or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until
such time as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain
covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”. At any time_
when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction,
each of which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance
that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating if achieved
will be maintained.

## USE OF PROCEEDS

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
are shown in the table below. Actual amounts are subject to adjustment and may differ from
these estimated amounts, depending on several factors, including the amount of debt, cash and
cash equivalents held by the Target, the amount reinvested by certain members of the current
management team of the Target as part of the Target Management Reinvestment and the actual
amount of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with, the timing of the Completion Date
and the fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering
Memorandum and the Completion Date. This table should be read in conjunction with
“Capitalization”.

(1) Assumes the Notes will be issued at par.
(2) Represents the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will
use a portion of the proceeds from the Notes offered hereby and available cash on balance sheet to deposit with the trustee
for holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes (or an agent thereof) an amount sufficient to redeem the Existing Floating
Rate Notes in full (including accrued interest to, but excluding, the expected date of redemption). In particular, for purposes
of the Refinancing: (i) €228.3 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to,
among others, finance the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo and to fund a portion of the Danish
HoldCo I/C Loan to Danish HoldCo, will be redeemed with proceeds from tranche “A” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is
expected to be equal to approximately €378.3 million (“Tranche A”); (ii) €52.9 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the
proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the Flos I/C Loan to Flos, will be redeemed with proceeds from
tranche “B” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is expected to be equal to approximately €52.9 million (“Tranche B”); and
(iii) €38.8 million of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the proceeds of which were used by the Issuer to fund a portion of the
B&B I/C Loan to B&B, will be redeemed with the proceeds from tranche “C” under the Notes which, in aggregate, is expected
to be equal to approximately €38.8 million (“Tranche C”). We expect that the Existing Floating Rate Notes will be redeemed
in full on the Issue Date or shortly thereafter, as notified to the holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes pursuant to the
conditional notice of redemption dated May 10, 2021. See also “Capitalization”. For further information on Tranche A,
Tranche B and Tranche C, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at_
identifying the separate portions of the proceeds of the Offering being used to consummate the Acquisition and the various
elements of the Refinancing, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (ISINs or common codes) for each
such tranche.
(3) Represents accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Floating Rate Notes from May 15, 2021 (which is the next interest
payment date) to, but excluding, an estimated date of redemption of May 20, 2021. See also footnote (1) under
“Capitalization” where we have adjusted our Cash and short-term deposits for, inter alia, the payment of accrued interest on
the Existing Notes to be made on May 15, 2021.
(4) Represents the estimated euro amount required to complete the Acquisition to be partially funded with the proceeds from
Tranche A under the Notes. The total amount required to complete the Acquisition on the Completion Date may vary from
the amount indicated due to a number of factors, including the effect of adjustments to the Acquisition consideration
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the timing of the Completion Date, the amount reinvested by certain members of
the current management team of YDesign as part of the Target Management Reinvestment and the fluctuation of the
U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering Memorandum and the Completion Date. We may enter
into hedging arrangements to hedge against such exchange rate risk. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions”,
“—The Transactions—The Acquisition”, “—The Transactions—Escrow Account” and “Capitalization”.
(5) Represents estimated transaction costs associated with the Transactions, including initial purchaser discounts, commitment
and financial advisory fees, hedging fees (if any) and other transaction costs and professional expenses to be partially funded
with the proceeds from Tranche A under the Notes.

## CAPITALIZATION

The following table sets forth the cash and short-term deposits and the capitalization of the
Group as of December 31, 2020, on an actual basis and as adjusted on a pro forma basis to give
effect to the Transactions. This table should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and the Issuer’s 2020 Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
Except as set forth below, there have been no other material changes to our capitalization since
December 31, 2020.

(1) The as adjusted cash and short-term deposits figure reflects our cash and short-term deposits as of December 31, 2020 minus
the amount of cash we expect to use in connection with the Transactions (€5.4 million), as described under “Use of
_Proceeds”. The as adjusted cash and short-term deposits figure does not include €17.7 million of interest payments in respect_
of the Existing Notes which fall due on May 15, 2021 or the amount of cash generated and not utilized by the Group
between December 31, 2020 and the Completion Date. Our cash and short-term deposits as of the estimated Completion
Date might deviate, also materially, from our estimates due to a number of factors, including the actual Completion Date, the
fluctuation of the U.S. Dollar to euro exchange rate between the date of this Offering Memorandum and the Completion
Date and the amount of cash generated and not utilized by the Group between December 31, 2020 and the Completion
Date.
(2) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes, before the deduction of €23.7 million of unamortized debt
issuance costs and excluding €5.6 million of accrued but unpaid interest as of December 31, 2020. A portion of the cash
proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with available cash on the Issuer’s balance sheet, will be used by the Issuer
to satisfy and discharge and ultimately redeem the Existing Floating Rate Notes at a price of 100% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and additional amounts, if any.
We expect that the Existing Floating Rate Notes will be satisfied and discharged on the Issue Date and ultimately redeemed
shortly thereafter.
(3) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby, before the deduction of unamortized debt issuance
costs, which will be accounted for as a reduction of the carrying value of the Notes in the Issuer’s financial statements and
amortized over the term of the Notes. If the Acquisition is not completed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer
will be required to redeem Notes with an aggregate issue price equal to €150.0 million at a redemption price equal to the
issue price thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to but excluding such special mandatory redemption
date and additional amounts, if any. The redeemed Notes shall be selected pro rata for redemption from all of the Notes. See
“Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.
(4) Represents the €100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility established under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn.
(5) Mainly represents IFRS 16 lease liabilities (€46.9 million) and certain minor financial indebtedness. We expect such financial
liabilities to remain outstanding immediately following the Refinancing.
(6) Does not reflect (i) €23.7 million of amortized debt issuance costs and (ii) €5.6 million of accrued but unpaid interest as of
December 31, 2020, in each case in respect of the Existing Notes.
(7) No adjustment has been made to the shareholders equity as a result of the Transactions See “Use of Proceeds”.

## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

_The historical data below should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other_ _Information”,_ _“Use_ _of_ _Proceeds”,_ _“Capitalization”,_ _“Summary_ _Historical_ _Financial_
_Information and Other Data”, “Selected Historical Financial Information” and along with the_
_Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto, included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. The information below is not necessarily indicative of our future results_
_of operations. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our_
_plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in_
_these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences_
_include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum, particularly in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking_
_Statements”._

##### Overview

We are one of the leading global design companies in the high-end furniture and lighting
markets. We design, produce, distribute and sell high-end lighting and furniture solutions,
through three companies with leading market positions: Flos, an Italian lighting producer, Louis
Poulsen, a Danish lighting producer, and B&B, an Italian furniture producer. With total revenue
of €526.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA of €128.7 million and net profit of €22.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, we are one of the leading companies in the high-end design market
globally. We benefit from the unique brand heritage and iconic products of each of Flos, Louis
Poulsen and B&B and provide a complementary, high-end offering across a broad range of
product categories, brands, sales channels and geographic areas. Following the ongoing
acquisition of YDesign, a leading e-commerce retailer in the U.S. online high-end lighting market
with net sales of USD163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect to
complement our existing Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B businesses by strengthening our U.S. and
online presence.

The joint strategic direction of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B under one combined group, together
with our long-standing relationships with top designers and specifiers, our strong and
recognizable brands, our broad and diversified offering of top quality products, our extensive
geographical footprint and our omni-channel distribution network, has generated, and is
expected to continue generating, revenue and cost synergies since the combination of the three
businesses was completed in November 2018. It has also expanded our customer reach and
product portfolio and positioned us to deliver strong cash generation despite the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

118


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 61.8% of our revenue from contracts with
customers from the lighting category, which includes both indoor and outdoor products, with
our lighting brands Flos and Louis Poulsen accounting for 39.0% and 23.4% of our revenue from
contracts with customers and revenues related to Design Holding that are generated by each
brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations, respectively. For the same period, we have
generated 38.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers from the furniture category,
which includes living room and bedroom products, outdoor products and kitchens, that we
design through our furniture brands B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea (all of which belong to the
B&B group), accounting for approximately 26%, approximately 7% and approximately 5% of our
revenues, respectively. The following charts set forth a breakdown of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020 by product category and primary brand:

Furniture
38%

Lighting
62%

Louis Poulsen[(1)(2)]

23% Flos(2)

39%

B&B(2)

(1) Louis Poulsen includes an immaterial portion of non-Louis Poulsen branded revenues (e.g. Targetti).
(2) Calculated as a percentage of Revenue from contracts with customers and Revenue related to Design Holding that is
generated by each brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations.

As a global design company, we provide a full range of high-end furniture and lighting solutions
to a diversified customer base of individual consumers, architects, designers and other specifiers
for residential use and businesses around the globe for commercial use through an omni-channel
approach comprising four key sales channels:

(i) _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel comprises over 4,845 brick-and-mortar points of sale_
located around the world across a range of formats, including third-party mono-brand
stores and shop-in-shops, corners and displays within multi-brand design retailers, as well as
online third-party retailers;

(ii) _Contract. Our contract channel delivers bespoke design services for residential and_
commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom-made
products, as well as certain complementary products from third-party producers;

(iii) Directly-Operated Stores (“DOS”). Our DOS channel comprises retail stores that are directly
managed from our headquarters and sell only products from Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B,
either individually by company or in a combination with products from our other
companies, including our two new D-Studio stores which we plan to open during the course
of 2021 in Milan and Copenhagen and which will sell products from all our brands; and

(iv) _Direct online. Our direct online channel consists of our e-commerce websites currently_
selling products from Flos and Louis Poulsen in different geographies (mainly North
America, in respect of both Flos and Louis Poulsen, and the main European countries, in
respect of Louis Poulsen only).

The following chart sets forth a breakdown of our revenue for the year ended December 31,
2020 by sales channel:


DOS[(2)]

(1) Wholesale excludes revenues derived from the direct online channel. Wholesale includes e-tailers.
(2) DOS includes revenues from directly operated Flos and B&B stores.
(3) Online includes revenues from Flos’ and LP’s e-commerce websites.

We operate directly or indirectly in approximately 140 countries around the world. The following
chart sets forth a breakdown of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 by
geography:


APAC & others
16%

North America
14%


Italy
14%


Rest of Europe
55%

Our products are distinguished by their design content, combining innovation and technology
with the rich design heritage that characterizes the Italian and Danish traditions. Each of Flos,
Louis Poulsen and B&B maintains a portfolio of iconic products, a number of which have been
popular for more than 50 years and were created in collaboration with some of the most
prestigious designers in the world, including Antonio Citterio, Gaetano Pesce, Achille and Pier
Giacomo Castiglioni, Philippe Starck, Poul Henningsen and Arne Jacobsen. Our products have
received numerous global design awards and are held in the permanent collections of art and
design museums worldwide, including in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art
Institute of Chicago, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris and
La Triennale di Milano in Milan. Throughout our history, our continuous efforts in technology
and product development coupled with our strong relationships with prestigious designers and
our ability to attract up-and-coming design talents have enabled us to complement our heritage
collection with successful new products that have reinforced the growth of each of our brands
over the years.

Our diversified sales organization is supported by a strong digital presence, with a number of
initiatives underway to support the online presence of our companies, including the expansion of
our online business, through the launch of a new state-of-the-art e-commerce platform with the
support of a dedicated in-house team and of our shareholders’ operating partners, and the
Acquisition which will allow for the expansion of our online channel especially in North America.
We are also continuing to expand our DOS presence through the launch of two D-Studio multibrand and multifunctional flagship stores in Copenhagen and Milan, which we expect will open

-----

in 2021, where products from all our brands will be sold singularly or through tailor-made
projects providing “soft-contract” solutions for business-to-customer (“B2C”) and
business-to-business (“B2B”) customers, and through a recently-launched joint venture
partnership with Fendi which we expect to also be supported by a dedicated DOS network. See
“—Recent Developments—Joint Venture with Fendi”.

The ongoing combination of our businesses and brands is still in the process of delivering
revenue and cost synergies, including,among others, the selective expansion of the store
network, the further development of cross-selling among brands and the creation of D-Studios.
We expect that the ongoing integration of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B will also provide
opportunities for cost synergies, including through the transfer of the production of selected
architectural products of Flos and Louis Poulsen to our Spanish facilities and the opening and
recent renovation of the Arclinea headquarters and training center in Caldogno, in north eastern
Italy. Additional synergies are expected to be developed from the integration of the YDesign
Group, primarily through the distribution of our products through the YDesign Group’s online
platform. See “—Our Strategies—Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment
_from Group integration and the Acquisition”._

##### Presentation of Financial Information

In this Offering Memorandum, including this “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
_condition and results of operations”, we discuss our consolidated financial condition and results_
of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

The consolidated profit and loss data and statement of financial position of the Issuer as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented in this Offering Memorandum have been
derived from the corresponding comparative column in the 2020 Consolidated Financial
Statements (and not from the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements), which reclassified certain
profit and loss and financial position line items in the 2019 financial statements for the purpose
of presenting the transactions and financial position between the Issuer and its direct parent
company, Design Holding, separately from the rest of the Issuer’s financial information. These
reclassified line items are: (i) in the consolidated profit and loss statement, “revenues from
contracts with customers”, “personnel costs” and “service costs” and (ii) in the consolidated
statement of financial position, “other non-current assets”, “trade receivables”, “tax assets and
other current assets”, “trade payables” and “tax payables and other current liabilities”. We
believe such reclassification better reflects the structure of the Group, given Group management
is located at the level of Design Holding, whereas the Issuer is the reporting company. For further
information, see “Presentation of financial and other information” and “Management”.

In this section, we present revenue breakdowns by (i) brand (Flos, LP and B&B), which reflect our
accounting segments under IFRS 8 and by (ii) sales channel, product category and geographical
area, which do not represent accounting segments under IFRS 8. The business division
information presented herein should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial
Statements. In addition, we also present certain unaudited estimated revenue breakdowns by
brand, sales channel, product category and geographic area on a pro forma basis for the
Acquisition. See “Presentation _of_ _Financial_ _Information—Certain_ _Aggregated_ _Revenue_
_Breakdowns of the Issuer and YDesign”._

**_2018 Pro Forma Information_**
The Issuer is a holding company which was incorporated on September 10, 2018 for the purpose
of the Original Acquisition. Therefore, the audited profit and loss statement of the Issuer for the
period ended December 31, 2018 presented herein only reflects approximately one month of
activity of the Group starting from the completion of the Original Acquisition on November 22,
2018 and is not comparable to the audited profit and loss statement of the Issuer for the year
ended December 31, 2019. For purposes of facilitating the comparison of our results of
operations among the periods under review, we also discuss the following selected pro forma
profit and loss items for the year ended December 31, 2018: (i) total revenues, (ii) total costs, and

(iii) Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the “2018 Pro Forma Information”). The 2018 Pro Forma
Information gives pro forma effect to the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish
HoldCo on November 22, 2018, as well as all the transactions related to such acquisition,
including, inter alia, the equity contribution by the Sponsors into the Issuer, the issuance of the
Existing Notes by the Issuer and the refinancing of certain previously existing indebtedness of
Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo, as if all such events had occurred on January 1, 2018. The 2018 Pro
Forma Information has been prepared by management for illustrative purposes only. Neither our
independent auditors or any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or
performed any procedures with respect to the 2018 Pro Forma Information for the purpose of its
inclusion herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors or
any other independent auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance
with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum. Therefore, the comparability
of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 with our results of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 is limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to

##### Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of the Group

**_General Economic and Industry Conditions_**
Our business is dependent on the demand for high-end furniture and lighting products,
especially in Europe and North America, which make up a significant portion of our revenue.
Demand for our products is in part affected by general economic conditions, consumer
confidence and spending patterns. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected since the
first quarter of 2020 and continues to affect global macroeconomic conditions, impacting global
consumer confidence and GDP growth. All of the markets in which we operate have been
adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “—COVID-19” below and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to_
_continue to pose risks to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,_
_and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”. Changes in_
general economic conditions directly impact the levels of spending by consumers and businesses
on discretionary products, such as high-end furniture and lighting solutions. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—We are affected by general economic conditions worldwide, and_
_unfavorable economic conditions could result in a decline in the demand for our products and a_
_material adverse effect on our financial performance”. According to the Industry Report, the_
global market has grown approximately 4% in each of 2018 and 2019, from a size of
approximately €35 billion in retail value in 2017 to approximately €38 billion and after a
decrease in 2020, it is expected to rebound in 2021. In addition to being positively affected by
improving global economic conditions following the crisis, the high-end design market has also
generally benefited from a growing population of luxury consumers and from the
“westernization” of Asian consumers’ taste, which has further contributed to the expansion of
certain high-growth Asian markets, in particular China.

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and therefore prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
such factors, together with the growth of the global economy and of most markets where we
operate, in particular Europe, positively contributed to the growth of our business. Our total
revenue grew from €541.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma) to
€565.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to an increase in
consolidated sales across Flos, LP and B&B as compared to the prior year. Following the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue decreased from €565.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €526.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily
due to Flos and B&B Italia, which experienced declines in revenue of €27.6 million and
€17.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the impact of

122


-----

COVID-19, as compared to the prior year. For a description of the impact that the COVID-19
pandemic has had on our business and results of operations, please see “—COVID-19” below. For
the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that, on a pro forma basis for the Acquisition,
Flos would have represented approximately 31%, B&B Italia would have represented
approximately 21%, Louis Poulsen would have represented approximately 18%, Maxalto would
have represented approximately 5%, Arclinea would have represented approximately 4%,
Lumens would have represented approximately 13%, YLighting would have represented
approximately 8% and Azucena would have represented approximately 0.1%, in each case of our
Aggregated 2020 Revenue. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Certain Aggregated Revenue Breakdowns of the Issuer and YDesign”._

For a description of the key drivers of growth in the high-end design market, see also “Industry
_and Market Data”._

**_COVID-19_**

In the first quarter of 2020, certain governments of the countries in which we operate imposed
significant lockdown and other restrictive measures in an aim to control the spread of the
COVID-19 pandemic and, in doing so, temporarily disrupted our business activity. Our strong
performance in 2019 and in the first few months of 2020 enabled us to enter the COVID-19 crisis
from a position of financial strength; in addition, the positive performance of our business in the
second half of the year, including due to our e-commerce capabilities as well as growth in the
online furnishing market, limited the negative effects of the prolonged shutdowns and other
restrictive measures in most of the countries in which we operate, which resulted in a 6.9%
decline in our total revenues from €565.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to
€526.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our Wholesale and Direct Online channels, which have well-developed e-commerce capabilities,
were equipped to benefit from the accelerated shift in consumer habits to online shopping that
has taken place since the onset of the pandemic. The share of revenue generated by our
Wholesale and Direct Online channels increased from 68.3% during the year ended December 31,
2019 to 73.3% during the year ended December 31, 2020, while our Contract and DirectlyOperated Stores (“DOS”) experienced a decline as compared to the prior year, as our DOS were
repeadetly shut for several weeks or otherwise faced reduced opening hours as a result of the
measures adopted by the competent government and authorities to prevent the spread of the
virus. We also experienced a decline in the demand for bespoke design and contract projects,
such as large fit-outs, during the lockdown periods, given our customers in the hospitality, retail,
travel industries were severely impacted by restrictions put in place following the onset of the
pandemic. For more information see “—Significant Factors Affecting the Results of Operations of
_the Group—Key Revenue and Cost Drivers by Sales Channel”._

The health and wellbeing of our members and staff remains of paramount importance and we
are fully engaged to ensure that our stores, when open, are a safe place to work. We have
implemented new standards and protocols which are being put in place across the industry.
These measures, including personal sanitization, capacity limits, social distancing and abundant
cleaning facilities, reduce the risk of transmission for customers and for our employees.
Nevertheless, these measures resulted in additional costs of €1.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020, such as cost for enhanced safety, measures in our plants, stores and offices,
increased shipping costs, and non-reimbursable costs that we incurred for setting up fairs that
were canceled. During the lockdown periods, we also incurred additional €3.1 million of costs in
various locations where we operate in relation to corporate departments and services that were
inactive or not effective due to the restrictions, such as warehouses and stores. Such additional
costs and expenses were only partially offset by cost reduction initiatives such as reduction of
discretionary spend, absence of travels and diminished marketing expenses due to the
cancellation of fairs and other events. In addition, we benefitted from certain subsidies available
to us as a result of the measures adopted by the governments of the countries in which we
operate, including recourse to Cassa Integrazione in Italy, ERE in Spain and furlough in the U.S.

See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and
_Pro Forma Data”._

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we cannot yet foresee the full impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and suppliers. Such impact will also depend on
future developments of the outbreak, including new information concerning the global severity
of and actions taken to contain the outbreak, rollout of vaccination programs and the ability of
existing or new vaccines to prevent the spread of new strains of the virus, which are highly
uncertain and unpredictable. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of
operations, liquidity and capital management. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—
_The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our_
_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and other epidemics or_
_outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact”._

**_Key Revenue and Cost Drivers by Sales Channel_**

We generate our revenue from sales to customers through the following four sales channels:

(i) _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel generated 66.7%, 68.3% and 73.3% of our revenue from_
contracts with customers for the years ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma), 2019 and
2020 respectively. It comprises brick-and-mortar stores located around the world and online
third-party retailers. In addition to these dealers, our customer base in this channel also
includes distributors and agents. The end customers of the wholesale channel are highly
diversified and include consumers, specifiers (e.g. architects, designers, contractors,
developers, etc.) and corporate customers. Revenue generated in the wholesale channel
reflects a discount on the retail price of our products, which in turn represents profit for our
direct customers.

(ii) _Contract. Our contract channel generated 24.6%, 23.9% and 19.7% of our revenue from_
contracts with customers for the years ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma), 2019 and
2020, respectively. It delivers bespoke design services for both residential and commercial
customers, either directly or through specifiers, utilizing products from our catalogues,
custom-made products and, when required, third-party products. Large “fit-out” projects in
the contract channel normally generate significant revenue streams, although depending
on the complexity and level of customization of each project, variable costs may be higher
than in our other sales channels. In the Flos Contract channel, royalty payments are
normally lower than in the Wholesale channel, as Architectural products, which are
primarily sold through the Contract channel, are less subject to royalty compared to
Decorative products, which are primarily sold through the Wholesale channel.

(iii) _Directly-Operated Stores (“DOS”). Our DOS channel generated 6.7%, 7.2% and 6.2% of our_
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma), 2019 and 2020, respectively. It
comprises retail stores of Flos and B&B that are directly managed from our headquarters.
Our customers in this channel are typically consumers and specifiers to whom we sell our
products directly. Unlike the wholesale channel, we have direct pricing control in the DOS
channel and so our revenue reflects the end price of our products. However, we incur fixed
costs in the DOS channel in connection with our stores that we do not have in our
wholesale channel. The impact that such fixed costs have on our margins primarily depends
on the location, geographic area and size of the relevant DOS.

(iv) _Direct online. Our direct online channel generated 0.6%, 0.6% and 0.8% of our revenue_
from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31, 2018 (pro forma), 2019
and 2020, respectively. It consists of e-commerce websites selling products from each of Flos,
B&B and Louis Poulsen. Our customers in this channel are typically consumers, architects and
designers to whom we sell our products directly. We have direct pricing control in our
online channel, as we do in our DOS channel, and our revenue reflects the end price of our
products. Moreover, online sales do not require the operation of a physical store and
delivery costs are normally paid by the customers. We expect that the online channel will

124


-----

represent an increasingly important channel for the sale of our products, also as a result of
the creation of a specialized e-commerce platform encompassing all of our brands, which
we expect to roll out in the third quarter of this year. See “Summary—Our Strategies—
_Develop our store network and foster growth of our online segment”._

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that, on a pro forma basis for the
Acquisition, our wholesale channel would have represented approximately 58%, our contract
channel would have represented approximately 16%, our online channel would have
represented approximately 22% and our DOS channel would have represented approximately
5%, in each case of our Aggregated 2020 Revenue. For further information, see “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Certain Aggregated Revenue Breakdowns of the Issuer and_
_YDesign”._

**_Research and Product Development and Technological Innovation_**

Maintaining the appeal of our products to existing customers and attracting new customers
depends in part on our ability to reflect prevailing trends and adapt to evolving technology and
customer taste. Our investments in research and product development and technological
innovation have allowed us to introduce new products, or updates to existing products, that we
believe are high quality, aesthetically appealing, suited to our customers’ needs and
technologically advanced. We continue to invest in research and product development and
technological innovation. To that end, we incurred capital expenditures for the development of
our products and updates to existing products of €1.2 million, €10.5 million and €10.0 million
for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively (see also “—Capital
_Expenditure”)._

Product development costs are also driven by changes in technology, particularly within our
lighting businesses. For example, a key focus in the lighting industry in recent years has been the
transition to LED technology, and most of Flos and Louis Poulsen’s products are now
LED-compatible. Although the trend towards LED products provides benefits (e.g. lower
manufacturing costs, ease of large-scale production and high versatility), the transition to LED
required a significant product development effort and investment over several years, starting
from approximately 2010.

Despite the continuing popularity of some of our older iconic designs that represent a significan
portion of our revenues, key drivers of our results of operations remain the rate at which we are
able to introduce new products across all of our brands and the related investments in product
development we are required to make. We estimate that we generated 36.1% of our revenue
from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the sale of products
which each of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen introduced during the last five years.

**_Advertising, Marketing and Promotional Expenses_**

Advertising, marketing and promotional expenses reflect the costs of building up the new
catalogue of products ahead of product launches and, more generally, tends to increase in
connection with key design industry events. Historically, such events occur in the spring and
include the Salone Internazionale del Mobile, held in Milan every April (except April 2020 and
April 2021 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic) and of particular importance for B&B.
Other key lighting and luxury design fairs include Euroluce, held biennially within the Salone
Internazionale del Mobile in Milan, Light + Building, held biennially in Frankfurt, and ICFF, held
annually in New York. Louis Poulsen’s advertising, marketing and promotional expenses also vary
throughout the year based on its product development cycle, which is focused on the
introduction of new products every September and February (see “—Significant Factors Affecting
_the Results of Operations—Seasonality”). During the internal preparation phases that precede_
each new product launch phase, advertising, marketing and promotional expenses are normally
higher as prototypes are developed, supply chains are engaged, production lines are prepared
and marketing content is deployed to the sales force. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
key design industry events have been cancelled and we have had to adapt our product launch

125


-----

processes in order to comply with COVID-19 related government restrictions, leveraging digital
marketing tools and online communication which replaced in person events. As a result, the
amount of Advertising, Marketing and Promotional Expenses for the year ended December 31,
2020 was approximately €16 million, decreasing by 20.1% compared to the previous year.

**_Product and Business Line Mix_**

Our results of operations are in part affected by the mix of products and brands that we sell, as
different brands, and different products and collections within each brand, can carry different
price points, entail different production, marketing and distribution costs and generate different
gross margins.

For example, Flos’ Decorative business line (Flos’ largest contributor to total revenue) normally
delivers Flos’ highest gross industrial margins (i.e. revenue after deducting cost of goods sold and
other direct industrial costs). Flos’ Architectural and Outdoor business lines’ gross margins are
typically moderately lower, although gross margins in the Architectural business line may vary
quite significantly from project to project, depending on, among other things, the location, size
and complexity of the project and the related industry (e.g. fashion luxury, hospitality, retail,
sports and leisure, airports, etc.).

At the contribution margin level (i.e. after deducting the variable selling costs) all of Flos’
business divisions deliver similar profitability levels, as the Decorative division normally incurs
higher variable selling costs than the other divisions, typically related to royalties and
transportation costs. In addition, sales generated by Flos DOS, which contribute to Flos’ total
revenue only to a very limited extent (1.9% in 2020), may yield higher or lower gross margins
than Flos’ wholesale channel, primarily depending on the performance of the individual store, as
well as the impact of the fixed costs associated with the leases of the real estate property where
Flos stores are located which vary by market and size of the individual store. In addition, gross
margins in the wholesale channel are impacted by the wholesalers’ profit and, to the extent
applicable, the relevant agents’ or distributors’ commissions, which are not applicable in the
retail channel where Flos sells directly to consumers.

Similarly for LP, indoor products normally deliver the highest gross margins, especially when sold
through the B2C division, whereas gross margins for outdoor products (which generated more
than half of LP’s B2B revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020) and non-decorative
products (i.e. architectural lighting products, both indoor and outdoor) are usually moderately
lower. Sales of third-party products, primarily produced by Targetti, Focus Lighting and Prolicht,
auxiliary products (e.g., poles for post tops), other components and services (e.g., freight), which
are normally associated with the B2B division, are only residual and tend to generate the lowest
margins.

For B&B, upholstered furniture, including sofas, armchairs, chairs and beds, generate the majority
of B&B’s revenue and are also the products that generate the highest gross margins, primarily
because production occurs on an industrial scale through cost-efficient manufacturing processes
(such as the application of polyurethane extrusions to a metal skeleton in a mold). Among the
B&B furniture brands, Maxalto products have a higher price point than B&B Italia products
primarily due to the different brand positioning of Maxalto and the exclusive materials utilized
in the Maxalto collections (such as special leathers and precious wood), and normally generate
higher gross margins, notwithstanding the higher production costs mostly deriving from the
supply of such materials. Sales of B&B Italia non-upholstered products for living room and
bedroom are normally associated with lower gross margins than any other B&B products, as
production is often customized, which results in higher production costs.

The sales channel or business division through which B&B products are sold may also impact B&B
gross margins. Normally, the Contract division, and especially the so-called “fit out” projects
where customers require turnkey delivery of interiors, floorings and installations, yield lower
gross margins than the Home division, mainly due to the high costs associated with the planning
and preparatory phases of the relevant project, which may take several months depending on

126


-----

the complexity of the project, and with the customization of the products. However, Contract
projects often provide for cross-selling opportunities and synergies with the rest of B&B’s
business and offer an opportunity to showcase B&B’s capabilities. Sales generated by B&B DOS
may yield higher or lower gross margins than those generated through the wholesale channel,
primarily depending on the performance of the individual store, as well as the impact of the
fixed costs associated with the leases of the real estate property where B&B stores are located,
which vary by market and the size of the individual store. In addition, gross margins in the
wholesale channel are impacted by the wholesalers’ profit and, to the extent applicable, the
relevant agents’ or distributors’ commissions, which are not applicable in the retail channel
where B&B sells directly to consumers.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that, on a pro forma basis for the Acquisition
(with YDesign’s net sales from lighting (indoor) and living room & bedroom amounting to
approximately 79% and 21% of YDesign’s net sales, respectively), lighting (indoor) would have
represented approximately 58%, lighting (outdoor) would have represented approximately 7%,
living room & bedroom would have represented approximately 23%, kitchen would have
represented approximately 4%, outdoor furniture would have represented approximately 4%
and other minor products would have represented approximately 4%, in each case of our
Aggregated 2020 Revenue. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Certain Aggregated Revenue Breakdowns of the Issuer and YDesign”._

**_Geographic Mix_**
Through our Flos, LP and B&B businesses, we have significant geographic diversity of sales that
includes Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region.

We operate directly or indirectly in approximately 140 countries. In the year ended December 31,
2020, we generated 69.4%, 14.4%, 14.7%, and 1.6% of our revenue, respectively, in Europe,
North America, APAC, and the rest of the world. Following the acquisition of YDesign, we expect
our geographic mix to reflect a higher contribution of the North American area, as the YDesign
Group sells products primarily to customers in the U.S. and Canada. For the year ended December
31, 2020, we estimate that, on a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, Europe would have
represented approximately 55% (comprised of approximately 11% in respect of Italy and
approximately 44% in respect of rest of Europe), North America would have represented
approximately 32% and APAC and others would have represented approximately 13%, in each
case of our Aggregated 2020 Revenue. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information—Certain Aggregated Revenue Breakdowns of the Issuer and YDesign”._
For more information, see “Our Business—Our Strategies—Expand our geographic reach”.

**_New Product Launches_**
Alongside the production and sale of our historical best-selling design icons, we continuously
develop new products and designs or update historical products and designs (e.g., by introducing
new upholstery materials for B&B) to adapt to the gradual evolution of customer tastes, thereby
reducing our exposure to risks inherent in changing customer preferences.

For example, we have focused on increasing B2C revenue within the existing point of sale
network for LP through a program of accelerated product launches, consisting of both
introductions of new product families and extensions of existing product lines, coupled with a
significant decrease of the average time to market between product development and launch.
LP’s B2B division has benefited from the increased focus on product innovation in the B2C
division, as both divisions have common themes and the accelerated product development
program has primarily been focused on Indoor products that are distributed across both divisions.

Several of the new product families introduced in recent years by LP target the underpenetrated
affordable luxury segment, balancing the previously luxury-focused portfolio and enabling LP to
diversify its customer base and reach a new category of customer previously unlikely to purchase
its products. Existing product lines were also extended and limited editions produced in order to
modernize iconic products, while simultaneously renewing interest in original versions.

127


-----

Between 2018 and 2020, Flos, LP and B&B launched approximately 16, 14 and 22 new products
(including extensions of existing product lines) on average each year. Most launches have been
highly successful and this strengthened focus on product development has been a primary
contributor to growth in revenue.

**_Investments in Communication, Marketing and Sales Organizations_**
We focus our communication and marketing efforts on four main areas: brand experience, sales
support, B2B relationships and B2C relationships. We have invested and continue to invest in
communication and marketing as a key part of our business strategy. Over the periods under
review, several initiatives have been implemented to increase efficiency and maximize the reach
of our sales and marketing functions. Such initiatives, most of which are still ongoing, have led,
among other things, to the establishment of dedicated sales organizations serving a number of
key markets, with the result that most of the markets in which we are present now have
dedicated sales organizations, internal marketing divisions, with an increase in the number of
full-time employees in marketing and digital marketing functions as well as e-commerce
departments. Since the beginning of 2020, marketing functions are coordinated across the brands
by a Group Head of Marketing. In addition, e-commerce initiatives are supported by a Group
Head of E-commerce since February 2021, who will direct the rollout of a state-of-the-art
e-commerce platform with dedicated organization, which will be unified across our brands.

Significant efforts were made also on improving the organization of the sales teams for the B2B
and B2C business divisions. A “SalesForce” customer relationship management (“CRM”) system
was implemented at Group level, to enable performance management of the sales teams and the
results have been used to develop a sales excellence initiative, which has narrowed the scope of
our B2B sales teams activities, allowing them to focus on the day-to-day sales projects. The sales
excellence initiatives, the main aim of which is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our
salesforce by way of, for example, sharing information on contracts and pipelines of new offers
among all of our brands and across geographies through a centralized infrastructure coordinated
by the Group Head of Contract.

In addition, we strengthened our digital marketing strategy as our companies increasingly have
focused on social media, with interactions with followers growing rapidly in size and significance.
LP’s followers on Instagram increased from approximately 150,000 as of September 2018 to over
340,000 as of April 2021, and followers on Facebook reached nearly 83,000 in April 2021
compared to approximately 65,000 in September 2018. Flos’ social network accounts have one of
the largest supporter bases among Italian design companies, comprised of approximately 900,000
followers across its social media accounts as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (including
Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Twitter). The Flos corporate website also receives
high traffic, recording approximately 3.4 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2020.

In 2021, we will continue our strategy of integrating Flos, B&B and LP by opening two multibrand and multifunctional D-Studio flagships in Copenhagen and Milan, which will offer a crossbrand experience of design and purchase both to the end customer and to the architectural and
design community.

For additional information on such focus areas, see “Our Business”.

**_Expansion of Third-Party Points of Sale Network_**
In the periods under review, we also upgraded our traditional wholesale distribution network, by
leveraging innovative marketing formats and tailored digital tools. In particular, our strategy in
respect of wholesale channel focuses on increasing the number of mono-brand shops and
enhancing the shop-in-shop experience of our customers.

Between 2018 and 2020, we expanded into new third-party multi-brand points of sale through a
combination of increased penetration of existing markets and entering new markets, particularly
in Western Europe and the APAC region. In addition, in 2020, we upgraded certain of our thirdparty multi-brand points of sale with new in-store concepts that were introduced to support
increased sales per store.

128


-----

**_Price Increases and Cost Efficiency Measures_**
Flos, B&B and LP normally increase the prices of their products on an annual basis at levels that
are considered reasonable, are generally higher than inflation rates and take into account a
number of factors, including inflation, increases in sourcing costs, fluctuations of the exchange
rate of the currencies of the various destination markets.

In addition to price increases, over the periods under review, Flos, LP, and B&B implemented a
number of improvements across the supply chain targeted at reducing costs and operating
expenses, ultimately resulting in higher margins. These improvements include, among other
things, an increase in outsourced production for certain high-volume products, renegotiation of
supply contracts with certain key suppliers of raw materials and product components,
streamlining the supplier base and reducing packaging costs.

In addition, B&B has recently started improving the technological status at its production
facilities. In particular, it upgraded technology in Caldogno (Italy), aiming to increase productivity
and volumes of both the Arclinea kitchen and wardrobes and in Novedrate and Misinto (Italy)
with the goal of increasing productivity and sales level of B&B Italia and Maxalto upholstery and
furniture.

**_Digitalization of Business Model_**
All our Group companies have embraced digital transformation to position us as a digital cuttingedge organization in our industry and markets.

Our use of digital technologies aims to create more effective business relationships with our
customers (such as dealers, end-customers, and specifiers), enhance customer experience in line
with evolving market expectations and customer habits, offer innovative design services to
customers through a data-driven, client-centric relationship approach.

Since 2020, we have started deploying a two-level organization, with certain key digital
competences shared at Group level and existing IT competences reinforced at the level of each of
the Group companies. In particular, our activities have focused on:

(i) increasing the automation process through the use of the CRM platform, which enables us
processing data to create, among others, tailored marketing campaigns;

(ii) simplifying the IT application of each of our companies, including by using the same SAP
ERP platform across the companies focusing on the lighting business (LP and Flos) and the
same Oracle platform across the companies focusing on the sale of furniture (B&B Italia and
Arclinea);

(iii) introducing a common platform for the entire Group’s e-commerce applications; and

(iv) developing advanced configurator systems, that allow both B2B and B2C customers,
distributors and specifiers to create their customized products online, thereby requiring the
adoption of a common platform at Group’s level.

In addition, our companies have made continuous progress on the digitalization of their business
model, by expanding the geographical reach and access of their corporate websites and
e-commerce platforms.

**_Supply Chain and Sourcing_**
For the Flos brand, we outsource almost all of our manufacturing requirements to carefully
selected third-party assemblers, with part of production on a make-to-order basis in order to
preserve cost efficiencies given the wide range of techniques and materials required for the
manufacture of Flos products. Within the Decorative and Architectural divisions, manufacturing is
mostly outsourced and assembly is almost entirely outsourced. The outsourcing of most
manufacturing processes lowers Flos’ fixed cost base, which results in high operational and
financial flexibility, as Flos may adapt to customer demand by increasing or decreasing
production, without a significant impact on margins. Approximatively 58% of the cost base of

129


-----

Flos for the year ended on December 31, 2020, is variable. Flos’ key variable costs include
sourcing costs (i.e. costs for electronic components, raw materials (e.g. glass, plastic, iron, stainless
steel and aluminium), painting processes, product assembly and costs for the purchase of finished
goods from Asia), royalties and commissions paid to designers and agents, respectively, and
transportation costs.

Flos contracts with a diverse group of non-exclusive suppliers to provide the raw materials and
finished products it requires. Suppliers and assemblers are carefully selected mainly according to
their technical capacity, quality, financial stability and cost and are usually located in close
proximity to Flos’ facilities to minimize transaction costs and lead times. Flos contracted with
approximately 650 suppliers in 2020, with no one supplier accounting for more than 5% of total
sourcing value.

Fluctuation of raw material and components prices affects Flos’ business to a limited extent. The
cost of raw materials and components normally represents a relatively small portion of the price
of Flos’ products and Flos has historically been able to pass any such increases on to customers.

For the Louis Poulsen and B&B brands, we outsource certain manufacturing processes to carefully
selected third-party assemblers, with the majority of B&B production being made on a
make-to-order basis in order to preserve cost efficiencies given the wide range of techniques and
materials required to manufacture B&B’s furniture. The outsourcing of some manufacturing
processes reduces Louis Poulsen’s and B&B’s fixed cost base, which results in high operational and
financial flexibility. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 51% of the cost base
of Louis Poulsen and B&B is variable, and includes sourcing costs (i.e. costs for components, raw
materials such as glass, plastic, iron, stainless steel and aluminium, external processing, and costs
for the purchase of finished goods), royalties and commissions paid to designers and agents and
transportation costs.

Fluctuation of prices for raw materials and components does not materially affect Louis Poulsen’s
and B&B’s business, as the cost of raw materials and components usually represents a relatively
small portion of the price of Louis Poulsen and B&B products and we have historically been able
to pass these increases on to customers.

**_Seasonality_**
For the past three years and in line with historical trends, Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B generated
a substantial part of their annual revenue and their EBITDA in the second half of the year
(especially in the last quarter of the year), as B2C product purchases and associated revenues
normally peak in connection with black Friday in November and the Christmas holiday season. As
a result of higher sales volumes in the third and fourth quarters of the year, our EBITDA margins
for these periods are higher than for the first half of the year.

##### Factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations

**_Purchase Price Allocation following the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos, B&B and Danish Holdco_**
**_in 2018_**
As part of the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) following the acquisition by the Issuer of Flos,
B&B and Danish Holdco on November 22, 2018, we allocated €52.5 million to increase in
inventory. In particular, pending an independent assessment on the acquired assets and
liabilities, which was completed in 2019, our financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2018 were based on provisional valuations of the fair value of intangible assets and
inventories. As such, the 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements include comparative
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 as restated to reflect the
final assessment on the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities (see Note 1.3 to the 2019
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Out of the €52.5 million surplus identified in the inventory as part of the PPA process,
€45.5 million negatively impacted our profit and loss statement (on a non-cash basis) for the year
ended December 31, 2019 through the reversal of such surplus under the line item “Purchases of

130


-----

_raw materials and variation in inventories”. Excluding this effect and the corresponding opposite_
tax effect of €12.4 million, our net result for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have
been positive at €23.5 million, as opposed to a loss of €9.6 million. As a result, the comparability
of our results between the year ended December 31, 2019 and the years ended December 31,
2020 and December 31, 2018 (the latter being negatively impacted by €7.0 million out of the
€52.5 million inventory surplus) is limited. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2019 presents a positive €45.5 million adjustment to neutralize such negative impact due to the
PPA allocation on our profit and loss statement for such year. See “Summary—Summary
_Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and Pro Forma Data”._

##### Key Income Statement Items

**_Revenues from contracts with customers_**
Revenues are stated net of returns, allowances, discounts and premiums, as well as taxes directly
related to the sale of goods or provision of services, in compliance with the accruals and
prudence concepts. Revenues from the sale for the goods are recognized when the production
process for the goods has been completed and the exchange has already taken place, upon the
substantial rather than formal transfer of title, with the transfer of risks and benefits being the
key parameter. Revenues from the provision of services are recognized once the services have
been provided. In connection with long-term contracts, revenues are recognized only once the
relevant project is completed.

**_Other revenues and income_**
Other revenues and income represents non-core business activities, including sundry revenues,
rental income, insurance repayments, revenue for transport, capital gains from asset disposals
and other items.

**_Purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories_**
Purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories includes costs associated with the supply
of materials, components, semi-finished or finished products and other goods used for operating
purposes. Inventory items whose estimated realizable value based on market trends is lower than
their carrying amount are written down, with a corresponding negative impact on the income
statement.

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs represent wages and salaries (including to members of the board of directors),
social security contributions, employee severance indemnities and pensions, as well as other
personnel costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.

**_Service costs_**
Service costs includes costs incurred in connection with production services, such as costs for
subcontracted production work, maintenance and ancillary costs, transport and customs costs,
commercial services, such as fees and royalties for advertising and communications,
administrative services, such as fees paid to certain corporate bodies (e.g., statutory auditors),
independent auditors and other professional consultants, and other minor services.

**_Provisions_**
Provisions represent amounts set aside for pension funds and business risks.

**_Other costs and charges_**
Other costs and charges primarily represent property rents and rental and leasing fees, as well as
other administrative costs.

131


-----

**_Amortization, depreciation and impairment_**
Amortization, depreciation and write-downs represent depreciation charges on tangible assets,
amortization charges on intangible assets and other write-downs. Depreciation is booked
monthly on a straight-line basis starting from the month when the asset is available for use or
potentially able to provide the economic benefits associated with it. Intangible fixed assets are
amortized along their useful life, with the amortization period and method reconsidered at least
at the end of each year. Profits or losses arising from the elimination of an intangible fixed asset
are measured by the difference between the net revenue of the disposal and the book value of
the intangible asset, and are recognized on the profit and loss statement of the year in which the
elimination occurs. Financial assets are tested for impairment at every balance sheet date with
write-downs recorded in the profit and loss statement when a loss event takes place that has an
impact on the future estimated cash flows of the financials assets, if such impact can be reliably
estimated.

**_Operating result_**
Operating result represents the difference between revenues from sales and services and
operating costs including amortization and depreciation (without the effects of applying IFRS 16)
and non-recurring costs excluding financial non-recurring costs and charges.

**_Non-recurring costs and revenues_**
Non-recurring costs and revenues consist of positive and negative components connected to
transactions whose occurrence is non-recurrent or from those operations or events that do not
occur frequently in the usual course of business.

**_Financial income_**
Financial income represents dividends received on financial investments, interest income
(including interest income on receivables from group enterprises), net capital gains on securities,
payables and transactions in foreign securities, amortization of financial assets and tax relief.

**_Financial charges_**
Financial charges represent interest expenses (including on payables to group enterprises), net
capital losses on securities, payables and transactions in foreign currencies, amortization of
financial liabilities and tax surcharges.

**_Income taxes_**
Current income taxes represent current tax and changes in deferred tax for the period. Tax
recognized in the income statement is the portion of tax attributable to the profit for the period.

the transactions between the Issuer and its direct parent company, Design Holding, separately from the rest of the Issuer’s
financial information. For additional information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

**_Revenues from contracts with customers_**
Revenues from contracts with customers decreased by €35.3 million or 6.4% from €555.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €520.6 for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was
mainly due to a decline in revenues as a result of COVID-19, which negatively impacted our B2B
clients in the hospitality, retail, travel and office industries, typically catered to by Flos and B&B
Italia. The decrease in Flos’ and B&B’s revenue was partially offset by higher revenues generated
by Louis Poulsen, which was allowed to continue operating its factories due to the less restrictive
measures adopted by the Danish government to reduce the spread of COVID-19, as compared to
most other European countries. Revenue from our DOS channel decreased mainly as a result of
the closure of our shops or restrictions to opening hours imposed by governments in most of the
countries in which we operate. Similarly, the Contract channel was negatively affected by
uncertainty on the evolution of the pandemic, which led to temporary postponement of new
projects. While our revenues from non-European markets (including North America and APAC)
decreased in 2020 compared to the previous year, including as a result of lower revenues from
Flos’ Architectural and Contract divisions, revenues generated in Europe remained substantially
stable, including as a result of the resilience of northern European markets, which contributed to
Louis Poulsen positive performance.

(2) Revenue breakdown by geographical area is presented as Revenue from contracts with customers generated in each
geographical area.

**_Other revenues and income_**
Other revenues and income decreased by €3.0 million or 36.1% from €8.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly
due to a decline in revenues from the performance of other services (e.g., transportation costs
and installation fees) and a decrease in sundry insurance reimbursements compared to the prior
year.

**_Purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories_**
Purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories decreased by €64.5 million or 29.5% from
€218.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €154.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories for 2019 was higher
due to (i) the reversal of the surplus values attributable to inventory as part of the purchase price
allocation (PPA) relating to the business combinations completed in 2018 and (ii) reduced
volumes in the purchase of raw materials and changes in inventories of work in progress due to
lower sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Personnel costs_**
Personnel costs decreased by €3.1 million or 2.8% from €112.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €109.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Personnel costs
decreased notwithstanding the increase in the average number of our employees to 1,704
employees for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1,688 employees for the prior
year.This was mainly due to reduced operating hours mandated by governments to contain the
spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of social security contributions and subsidies from
the governments of the countries in which we operate (including Italy, Spain and the U.S.).

**_Service costs_**
Service costs decreased by €8.9 million or 7.1% from €125.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €116.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due
to a reduction in outsourced production work, lower costs related to marketing in connection
with fairs and exhibitions, lower management fees and other costs owed to Design Holding and
reduced travel and lodging expenses following the imposition of COVID-19 related travel
restrictions.

**_Provisions_**
Provisions decreased by €1.1 million or 35.5% from €3.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to a reduction
of both the provisions for other risks and the provisions for other charges as a result of the
estimated lower risk of litigation and fees and expenses in relation thereto. Such reduction in the
provisions for other risks and other charges were only partially offset by increased provisions for
pension liabilities.

**_Other costs and charges_**
Other costs and charges decreased by €4.8 million or 36.9% from €13.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to €8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly
due to a reduction in costs related to property services, short term leases, rent and EDP license
fees and sundry and general expenses as a result of reduced operating activity due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Total costs_**
Total costs decreased by €87.3 million or 18.1% from €482.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €397.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the factors
discussed above, primarily (i) the one-off effects in 2019 of the reversal of the surplus values
attributable to inventory as part of the purchase price allocation (PPA) relating to the business
combinations completed in 2018 and (ii) our proactive and timely management of costs following
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Amortization, depreciation and impairment_**
Amortization, depreciation and impairment increased by €2.4 million or 7.7% from €31.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
This was mainly due to increased depreciation of both tangible assets and right of use assets (i.e.
leases), along with certain increased impairment of receivables.

**_Financial income_**
Financial income slightly decreased by €0.1 million or 4.8% from €2.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and mainly comprises
exchange gains relating to foreign exchange transactions.

**_Financial charges_**
Financial charges increased by €0.3 million or 0.5% from €57.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and mainly comprise
interest expenses related to the Existing Notes.

**_Result before tax from continuing operations_**
Result before tax from continuing operations increased by 45.5 million from negative
€4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €41.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to the sum of the abovementioned factors, including
reduced costs for purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories, personnel costs, service
costs and other costs and charges.

**_Income taxes_**
Income taxes increased by €13.4 million or 273.5% from €4.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due
to lower deferred income tax in 2019 caused by the reversal of the surplus values attributable to
inventory as part of the purchase price allocation (PPA) relating to the business combinations
completed in 2018.

**_Profit for the period_**
Profit for the period increased by €32.2 million or 335.4% from a loss of €9.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to a gain €22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to
the factors discussed above, primarily the €45.5 million one-off effects in 2019 of the reversal of
the surplus values attributable to inventory as part of the purchase price allocation (PPA) relating
to the business combination completed in 2018, slightly offset by an increase in taxes of
€13.4 million.

(1) Total costs include €33.5 million of management buy out costs and €15.5 million of transaction costs in connection with the
acquisition by the Issuer of each of Flos, B&B and Danish Holdco, completed in 2018.
(2) “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) for the period excluding the effect of income taxes, net financial expenses
(income), net financial chanrges and amortization and depreciation,as adjusted for certain non-core and non-recurring items
occurred in the relevant period, further adjusted for the year ended December 31, 2019 to remove the impact of IFRS 16 and
the associated interest expense.

**_Total revenues_**
Total revenues increased by €23.5 million or 4.3% from €541.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (pro forma) to €565.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was
mainly due to strong performance of the Contract and Retail DOS channels in the second half of
2019. Revenues of each of Flos, B&B and LP increased in 2019 compared to the previous year;
revenues generated in Italy slightly decreased in 2019 compared to the previous year, whereas
revenues generated in the rest of Europe, North America and the APAC regions increased
compared to 2018, driven by good performance of both the B2B and B3C channels.

**_Total costs_**
Total costs increased by €14.1 million or 3.0% from €468.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (pro forma) to €482.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was
mainly due to: (i) the one-off effects of the reversal of the surplus values as part of the purchase
price allocation (PPA) relating to the the business combinations completed in 2018 and (ii) higher
costs for purchases of raw materials and variation in inventories and higher personnel costs,
which were only partially offset by a decrease in other costs and charges. Among total costs,
non-recurring costs and revenues decreased in 2019 compared to the previous year, mainly due
to certain effects of the business combination that took place in 2018, which resulted in payment
of management buy out bonuses, transactions costs, and reversal of amortized financing costs.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**
Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1.8 million or 1.4% from €125.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (pro forma) to €127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,
primarily due to the good performance of Louis Poulsen and Flos supported by improved
efficiencies in operations management and sourcing processes, which offset certain operational
issues relating to planning and order scheduling that affected B&B’s performance in the first half
of the year and which were subsequently resolved.

##### Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity describes the ability of a group to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure,
debt service obligations, other commitments, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our
liquidity requirements arise primarily to meet our debt service obligations, fund capital
expenditures, including for our research and product development activities, fund salaries and
other associated costs, fund acquisitions and pay taxes.

Our primary source of liquidity is our cash from operating activities. Drawings under the
Revolving Credit Facility represent a supplemental source of liquidity which we could utilize from
time to time primarily for working capital requirements. As a precautionary measure, we entirely
drew the Revolving Credit Facility on March 17, 2020, to strengthen our cash position in the
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we fully repaid the
amount drawn, and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is
fully available for drawing. In the periods under review, our debt service obligations consisted
primarily of interest payments on the Existing Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility. Following the Transactions, including the offering of the Notes and the application of
the proceeds therefrom, our debt service obligations will consist primarily of interest payments
on the Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with
available borrowings will be adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt
service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows
from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments
on the Notes or other debt, including the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, when due. If our cash flows
from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure requirements
exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally
and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the
availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, and capital markets, restrictions in
instruments governing our debt, and our general financial performance. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness—Our substantial leverage and debt service_
_obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of_
_operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the Notes_
_Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Indebtedness—The Issuer_
_is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and depends_
_exclusively on cash from its operating companies, including, following the Acquisition, the Target_
_Group”._

**Net cash and cash equivalents at end of the period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **63.6** **92.7**

_Net cash flows from operations_
Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €24.8 million or 55.2% from €44.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €69.7 million for year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase was primarily due to: (i) €11.4 million of higher decrease in trade receivables, (ii)
€4.2 million of higher decrease in inventory (excluding the non-monetary effect of the purchase
price allocation (PPA) relating to the business combinations completed in 2018 which impacted
the net change in inventory for the year ended December 31, 2019), (iii) €1.1 million of lower
financial interest paid and (iv) €1.0 million of lower income taxes paid.

_Net cash flows from / (used in) investing activities_
Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by €18.6 million or 48.1% from €38.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €20.1 million for year ended December 31, 2020. The
decrease was primarily due to the lack of acquisitions of non-current financial assets and
non-controlling financial interests in 2020 as compared to 2019, when the Issuer acquired
approximately €18 million in shares of Design Holding.

_Net cash flows from / (used in) financing activities_
Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by €4.8 million or 30.6% from €15.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €20.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase was primarily due to a decrease in financial payables, as a result of lower short-term
debt toward banks and other lenders.

##### Capital Expenditure

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our capital expenditure was €22.7 million (4.3% of our
revenues) primarily to fund improvements at Arclinea’s plant in Caldogno and B&B’s plant in
Novedrate and for research and development expenditures. For the year ended December 31,
2019, our capital expenditure was €25.7 million (4.5% of our revenues), primarily to develop new
products, upgrade showrooms and other facilities used for operations.

The following table shows the breakdown of our total capital expenditure for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2020 into growth and maintenance capital expenditures:

**IFRS** **Year ended December 31,**

**in € million** **2019** **2020**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect our capital expenditure for 2021 to be
approximately double the amount of our capital expenditure for 2020. We expect such increase
will mainly relate to our ongoing digital transformation plan, which currently envisages the
installation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for Flos, the update of LP and
B&B’s existing ERP software and of the Group’s enterprise performance management (EPM)
software, the launch of a Group-wide e-commerce platform and the improvement of the existing
product configurators. We have also planned certain technical improvements at B&B’s plants in

##### Contingent Liabilities

We normally provide warranties for general repairs pursuant to contracts with our customers,
including in connection with LED products. Extended warranties or maintenance services are
usually not provided. The amount of the provisions for such contingencies included in our
financial statements as of December 31, 2020 was €3.5 million. Additionally, when we receive
advance payments in connection with a project in B&B’s Contract division, we may from time to
time be required to provide the relevant customer with bank guarantees and/or performance
bonds to protect the customer in case of our non-performance of our obligations under the
relevant contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, B&B bank guarantees and
performance bonds given to third parties amounted to €8.5 million, €6.0 million of which
related to contracts in the hospitality sector. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We
_may be subject to production and litigation risks associated with our commercial contract_
_divisions”._

##### Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

##### Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our activities and debt financing expose us to a variety of risks, the most significant of which are
exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management
strategy seeks to minimize the potential adverse effects of such risks.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**
The interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial
instrument will be changed because of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to the risk
of changes in market interest rates primarily relates to long-term debt with variable interest
rates, such as the Existing FRNs and, following the Refinancing, the Notes.

**_Exchange Rate Risk_**
The exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of an exposure will
vary because of fluctuations in exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of fluctuations in

139


-----

exchange rates arises mainly from the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or costs are
denominated in a foreign currency) and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Although the Group has a strong international presence, use of the Euro as the transactional
currency for most transactions currently mitigates the risk tied to exchange rate fluctuations. The
Group is mainly exposed to positions denominated in Euro, Danish Krone, Yen and U.S. Dollar;
however, current volumes do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial and economic
results. Consequently, no analysis was carried out with respect to the Group’s sensitivity to
fluctuations in exchange rates. Our exposure to the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro
is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of YDesign, which reports in U.S. dollar. In
particular, YDesign’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $163.2 million
and the effects on our consolidated financial results are only partially offset by the fact that
YDesign’s costs are also denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, in light of the fact that the
consideration for the Acquisition will be in U.S. dollars whereas the portion of gross proceeds
from the Notes which will be deposited into the Escrow Account pending closing of the
Acquisition will be in euro, we may enter into hedging arrangements to hedge the associated
exchange rate risk.

**_Credit Risk_**
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations in respect of a financial
instrument or a commercial agreement, thus leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to
the credit risk deriving from its operating activities (mostly for trade receivables and credit notes)
and deposits with banks and financial institutions.

The credit risk correlated to commercial counterparties is managed by the individual subsidiaries
and monitored by the Group. The Group has no significant credit risk concentrations. However,
procedures are in place to ensure that sales of products and services are carried out to customers
with high reliability, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other
factors. Credit limits on main customers are based on internal and external valuations on the
basis of thresholds approved by the head offices of the individual countries. Use of credit limits is
monitored periodically. We do not deem our customer credit risk to be high; therefore, we do
not hedge this risk beyond implementing ordinary credit risk management procedures and
controls. There are no receivables overdue for over 12 months.

**_Liquidity Risk_**
Liquidity risk is the risk we will not have enough financial resources available to meet our
financial obligations and commitments when due. In particular, the two main factors that
determine our liquidity are, on one hand, the resources generated or absorbed by operating and
investment activities and, on the other hand, the maturity and renewal of financial liabilities.
Historically, we have put in place certain procedures aimed at optimizing cash flow management
and reducing our liquidity risk, including the maintenance of an adequate level of available
liquid assets and adequate borrowing facilities. We continue to monitor our liquidity risk by
using a liquidity planning tool.

##### Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards

For a discussion of the critical accounting estimates and judgments and certain new accounting
standards affecting us, please see the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_IFRS 16 Leases_**
The Group applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time in the year ended December 31, 2019. The
nature and effect of the changes as a result of adoption of this new accounting standard is
described below.

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces the standards IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4.
Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and

140


-----

SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16
establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of lease
agreements and requires lessees to account for all lease agreement following a single accounting
model in the financial statements similar to the accounting treatment of financial leases
regulated by IAS 17.

The standard includes two exemptions to recognition for lessees—leases of “low value” assets
(e.g. personal Computers) and short-term lease agreements (i.e. lease agreements with a lease
period shorter than or equal to 12 months). At the starting date of a lease, the lessee should
recognize a liability relating to lease fees (i.e. the liability for the lease) and an asset that
represents the right to use the underlying asset during the duration of the lease (i.e. the right to
use the asset). The Lessee should also separately recognize interest expenses on the liability for
the lease and amortization on the right of use.

Lessees are also required to reconsider the amount of the liability relating to the lease upon
occurrence of determined events (e.g., a change of the duration of the lease, a change of the
future fees deriving from the change of an index or of the rate used to determine such
payments). In general, the lessee should recognize the re-measurement difference of the amount
of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right of use.

The accounting method for the lessor consistent with IFRS 16 remains substantially unchanged
with respect to the current accounting policies according to IAS 17. Lessors should continue to
classify all leases using the same classification principle of IAS 17 and distinguish two types of
leases: operating and financial leases. IFRS 16 also requires lessees and lessors to provide broader
disclosure compared to IAS 17. See also “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—IFRS” and
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions—Capitalized Lease Obligation” for information
regarding the treatment of lease accounting under the covenants to be included in the
Indenture.

The Group used the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease agreements for which the
term of the lease agreement expire within 12 months from the date of initial application and the
lease agreements for which the underlying asset has a low value.

The multi-year duration of the agreements required the exercise of a complex professional
judgement by the Corporate Management for the definition of the assumptions to be adopted
for the purposes of determining the impacts connected with the new provisions of the standard.
In particular, the main assumptions adopted regard:

- the assessment of the periods covered by extension or early termination options for the
purposes of the determination of the duration of the lease agreement; the separation of the
non-lease components;

- the assessment of the periods covered by extension or early termination options for the
purposes of the determination of the duration of the lease agreement;

- the discounting rate used for determining the lease liability, represented by the incremental
financing rate of the lessee. This rate was defined taking into account the duration of the lease
agreements, the currency in which they are denominated and the characteristics of the
economic environment in which lessees operate, defined on the basis of the country risk
premium attributed to the individual countries in which the Group operates. At present, the
range of these discount rates is between 4% and 5.6%.

**_Amendments to IFRS 16 COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions_**

On May 28, 2020, the IASB issued COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions—amendment to IFRS 16
Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease
modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a COVID-19 related
rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts

141


-----

for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession the same
way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change was not a lease modification.

The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020. Earlier
application is permitted. This amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial
statements of the Group. The amendments to the definition of material is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

drawers, tables, cabinets, desks, chairs and other furnishings;

- Kitchen: includes fitted kitchens, kitchen units, cupboards and other furniture and decorative
items;

- Bathroom: includes bathroom equipment products such as bath tubs, whirlpools, ceramics,
bathroom furniture, sanitary fittings, faucets, shower units and related accessories;

- Lighting: includes lighting products for both indoor and outdoor use such as pendants, floor
lamps, wall lamps, light fixtures, fittings and other lighting products; and

- Outdoor: includes outdoor furniture items such as tables, sofas, chairs and other items for
residential and commercial use.

Design Market

Source: Industry Report, Management Estimates

While our product portfolio spans all segments of the high-end design market, we primarily
operate in the Living and Bedroom and in the Lighting segments. Living and Bedroom represents
the largest segment of the high-end design market, accounting for almost 50% of the market
total value in 2019.

The distribution of high-end furniture and lighting products occurs through both direct and
indirect channels:

- Wholesale: includes products sold through a network of third-party distributors, agents, and
dealers across a range of formats, including third-party mono-brand stores and shop-in-shops,
corners and displays within multi-brand design retailers, as well as online third-party retailers,
to various types of customers including personal consumers, architects, designers, contractors,
developers and corporate customers;

- Retail: includes products sold directly by the producer through dedicated directly-operated
stores (comparable to our DOS channel);

- Contract: includes bespoke design services for residential and commercial customers; and

- Online: includes sales through both directly operated and third-party operated e-commerce
websites (in contrast to the Group’s direct online channel, which only includes directly
operated e-commerce websites).

The high-end design market has been growing steadily over the past few years. Between 2013
and 2019, the market grew at an average CAGR of 5% per annum, with a peak of 9% year-overyear growth in 2015. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, between 2018 and 2019, the market grew
steadily at a 4% growth rate, accelerating from the 3% growth experienced between 2017 and
2018. While data for 2020 are still provisional, preliminary forecasts estimate a market
contraction ranging between €2 billion and €3 billion, with the high-end design market
reaching €35 billion to 36 billion. While the market contracted as a result of the pandemic, the
following key trends emerged:

- Brand polarization: significant polarization took place across brands, with larger players
leveraging on their diversification (e.g. geography, channel, product), go-to-market initiatives
(e.g. e-commerce) and flexible supply chains to hedge against market contraction and smaller
players being more exposed and impacted by the pandemic and less eager to leverage on the
rebound of the market over the last months of 2020;

- Renewed relevance of the “home role”: through the COVID-19 pandemic, homes have become
the places where people spent most of their time, favoring consumer spending in the related
segments, especially the Living and Bedroom and Lighting segments to which we are
particularly exposed;

144


-----

- Online channel acceleration: the already ongoing shift to the online channel has strongly
accelerated, with many players reporting double-digit growth in their respective e-commerce
channels. We expect the Acquisition will further foster our exposure to such trend; and

- Geographic diversification: the Asian high-end design market proved to be generally more
resilient to the contraction in demand, replicating the pattern already observed during the
financial crisis in 2008. At the same time, the United States market benefitted from less
extended lock-downs and restrictions which ultimately resulted in a decreased contraction.

##### General Factors Affecting Our Market

**_Macro-economic and demographic factors_**
The high-end design market is characterized by a number of consumer trends that are segmentspecific. However, the market is generally influenced by three key factors:

- GDP growth;

- real estate market conditions; and

- consumer confidence and disposable income.

These factors tend to affect or reflect consumer behavior towards the purchasing of lighting and
furniture products. While demand for high-end design products is generally less price-elastic than
for products in other segments, slowdowns in real estate development also tend to affect
high-end design products’ demand.

Other factors affecting market performance include demographic and socio-economic trends,
such as:

- increasing urbanization rates, especially in emerging economies;

- decreasing average household size;

- improving availability of western consumer goods driven by the increasing prevalence of large
organized retail chains in many large emerging economies; and

- rapid growth of middle and high-income middle classes in emerging markets, who are
increasingly oriented towards sophisticated and high-end design products.

**_Other factors_**
Demand is also affected by product innovation deriving from technological advances. The
introduction of LED technology in the lighting segment, for instance, has fostered the design of
new products, while also lowering production costs. The efficiency of LED technology has acted
as a further driver of demand, bolstered by the importance of energy saving solutions in modern
projects and certifications (e.g. LEED).

145


-----

Other factors influencing demand are the availability of credit (including both the availability of
financing for real estate developments and the provision of mortgage financings) and the
product replacement cycle (i.e. the frequency with which consumers purchase replacement
products). Consumer spending trends across different segments show that:

- the Lighting and Outdoor segments are generally characterized by shorter replacement cycles
and lower average pricing per item (given the typically smaller size of these items); and

- the Kitchen segment is generally characterized by longer product replacement cycles and
higher pricing per item.

##### Envisaged market evolution

Europe (including Turkey and Russia) accounts for approximately 50% of the high-end design
market, the Americas (including North and South America) accounts for approximately 31%,
APAC (including Asia and Japan but excluding Australia and New Zealand) accounts for
approximately 16% and the Rest of the World accounts for approximately 6%. The increasing
importance of the APAC region in the global high-end design market has been driven by
continued demand over the last few years, mainly reflecting the economic performance of the
reference economies. Less pronounced market growth in Europe in recent years has led to an
increase in the relative share of APAC and the Americas in the overall market.

Rebounding GDP growth in the world’s larger economies following the COVID-19 pandemic, the
renewed “home role”, the recovery of the real estate market coupled with historical trends such
as a rising class of middle and high-income consumers in emerging markets, and the ongoing
“westernization” of Asian consumer preferences are all expected to have a positive impact on
future demand. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, current trading for the first
months of 2021 has already confirmed strong performance for different players both in terms of
booked revenues and orders pipeline. We expect the increase in demand will be driven primarily
by the APAC region, with expected growth per annum to 2026 ranging between 8% and 11%.
Demand in Europe and Americas is expected to further benefit from favorable demand trends
with respective expected growth per annum of 3% to 5% and 2% to 4%, respectively.

##### Competition

We distinguish three main groups of competitors in the markets in which we operate:

- pure design, personal luxury and designer-driven brands;

- premium design brands; and

- branded retailers.

146


-----

Pure design brands (including Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen) are usually European independent
players who have developed significant design heritage through a long track record of iconic
products. Pure design brands are characterized by their strong design roots, collaborations with
prestigious architects and designers, iconic products and international reach, primarily through
multi-brand retailers, as well as by their high specialization and strong production skills. Other
notable pure design brands include Artemide, Vitra, Poltrona Frau and Bulthaup.

Personal luxury brands are typically large luxury brands that have diversified into homewares.
Personal luxury brands rely on their brand strength to market their products and as a result, the
design of the products tends to reflect the influence of the style of the brand’s creative directors.
Personal luxury brands typically rely on external production and utilize a mixed distribution
model, with sales through a combination of multi-brand retailers and directly operated stores.
Personal luxury brands include brands such as Armani Casa, Fendi Casa, Kenzo and Versace.

Designer-driven brands are typically managed by a single iconic designer who leverage their
“brand name” to generate demand. Designer-driven brands tend to position their products as a
lifestyle offering, characterized by a strong identity and recognizable style. Production of
designer-driven brands is typically external. Examples of designer-driven brands are Liaigre and
Visionnaire.

Premium design brands are typically Lighting and Furniture retailers that either have general
upper-premium positioning (with differences among geographies) or have more mainstream
positioning but have extended certain product lines into the upper-premium range. This includes
brands such as Ligne Roset, Cattelan Italia, Moen and Kos.

Branded retailers are typically geographically specific mono-brand retailers with an upperpremium positioning, such as Restoration Hardware, Williams Sonoma and Design Within Reach.

The degree of competition among these brands differs by geographic area. Branded retailers
have had considerable success in the United States market and their significant growth over the
last few years has been partially linked to the overall positive performance of the United States
economy. Retailers accounted for approximately 15% of the total high-end design market by
value in 2019. Pure design brands tend to be more common in the European market, but are also
present in the United States market, predominantly in large cities such as Los Angeles and New
York. The competitive environment in Europe remains more fragmented, with small pure design
brands addressing specific customer segments or serving a specific design taste in niche markets.
Personal luxury brands are more popular in emerging economies, which is where most of their
revenues originate. Premium and pure design brands accounted for approximately 84% of the
market in 2019.

## OUR BUSINESS

##### Overview

We are one of the leading global design companies in the high-end furniture and lighting
markets. We design, produce, distribute and sell high-end lighting and furniture solutions,
through three companies with leading market positions: Flos, an Italian lighting producer, Louis
Poulsen, a Danish lighting producer, and B&B, an Italian furniture producer. With total revenue
of €526.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA of €128.7 million and net profit of €22.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2020, we are one of the leading companies in the high-end design market
globally. We benefit from the unique brand heritage and iconic products of each of Flos, Louis
Poulsen and B&B and provide a complementary, high-end offering across a broad range of
product categories, brands, sales channels and geographic areas. Following the ongoing
acquisition of YDesign, a leading e-commerce retailer in the U.S. online high-end lighting market
with net sales of USD163.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect to
complement our existing Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B businesses by strengthening our U.S. and
online presence.

The joint strategic direction of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B under one combined group, together
with our long-standing relationships with top designers and specifiers, our strong and
recognizable brands, our broad and diversified offering of top quality products, our extensive
geographical footprint and our omni-channel distribution network, has generated, and is
expected to continue generating, revenue and cost synergies since the combination of the three
businesses was completed in November 2018. It has also expanded our customer reach and
product portfolio and positioned us to deliver strong cash generation despite the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 61.8% of our revenue from contracts with
customers from the lighting category, which includes both indoor and outdoor products, with
our lighting brands Flos and Louis Poulsen accounting for 39.0% and 23.4% of our revenue from
contracts with customers and revenues related to Design Holding that are generated by each
brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations, respectively. For the same period, we have
generated 38.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers from the furniture category,
which includes living room and bedroom products, outdoor products and kitchens, that we
design through our furniture brands B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea (all of which belong to the
B&B group), accounting for approximately 26%, approximately 7% and approximately 5% of our
revenues, respectively. The following charts set forth a breakdown of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020 by product category and primary brand:

As a global design company, we provide a full range of high-end furniture and lighting solutions
to a diversified customer base of individual consumers, architects, designers and other specifiers
for residential use and businesses around the globe for commercial use through an omni-channel
approach comprising four key sales channels:

(i) _Wholesale. Our wholesale channel comprises over 4,845 brick-and-mortar points of sale_
located around the world across a range of formats, including third-party mono-brand
stores and shop-in-shops, corners and displays within multi-brand design retailers, as well as
online third-party retailers;

(ii) _Contract. Our contract channel delivers bespoke design services for residential and_
commercial customers, utilizing both products from our catalogues and custom-made
products, as well as certain complementary products from third-party producers;

(iii) Directly-Operated Stores (“DOS”). Our DOS channel comprises retail stores that are directly
managed from our headquarters and sell only products from Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B,
either individually by company or in a combination with products from our other
companies, including our two new D-Studio stores which we plan to open during the course
of 2021 in Milan and Copenhagen and which will sell products from all our brands; and

(iv) _Direct online. Our direct online channel consists of our e-commerce websites currently_
selling products from Flos and Louis Poulsen in different geographies (mainly North
America, in respect of both Flos and Louis Poulsen, and the main European countries, in
respect of Louis Poulsen only).

Our products are distinguished by their design content, combining innovation and technology
with the rich design heritage that characterizes the Italian and Danish traditions. Each of Flos,
Louis Poulsen and B&B maintains a portfolio of iconic products, a number of which have been
popular for more than 50 years and were created in collaboration with some of the most
prestigious designers in the world, including Antonio Citterio, Gaetano Pesce, Achille and Pier
Giacomo Castiglioni, Philippe Starck, Poul Henningsen and Arne Jacobsen. Our products have
received numerous global design awards and are held in the permanent collections of art and
design museums worldwide, including in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art
Institute of Chicago, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris and
La Triennale di Milano in Milan. Throughout our history, our continuous efforts in technology
and product development coupled with our strong relationships with prestigious designers and
our ability to attract up-and-coming design talents have enabled us to complement our heritage
collection with successful new products that have reinforced the growth of each of our brands
over the years.

Our diversified sales organization is supported by a strong digital presence, with a number of
initiatives underway to support the online presence of our companies, including the expansion of
our online business, through the launch of a new state-of-the-art e-commerce platform with the
support of a dedicated in-house team and of our shareholders’ operating partners, and the
Acquisition which will allow for the expansion of our online channel especially in North America.
We are also continuing to expand our DOS presence through the launch of two D-Studio multibrand and multifunctional flagship stores in Copenhagen and Milan, which we expect will open
in 2021, where products from all our brands will be sold singularly or through tailor-made
projects providing “soft-contract” solutions for business-to-customer (“B2C”) and
business-to-business (“B2B”) customers, and through a recently-launched joint venture
partnership with Fendi which we expect to also be supported by a dedicated DOS network. See
“—Recent Developments—Joint Venture with Fendi”.

The ongoing combination of our businesses and brands is still in the process of delivering
revenue and cost synergies, including,among others, the selective expansion of the store
network, the further development of cross-selling among brands and the creation of D-Studios.
We expect that the ongoing integration of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B will also provide
opportunities for cost synergies, including through the transfer of the production of selected
architectural products of Flos and Louis Poulsen to our Spanish facilities and the opening and
recent renovation of the Arclinea headquarters and training center in Caldogno, in north eastern
Italy. Additional synergies are expected to be developed from the integration of the YDesign
Group, primarily through the distribution of our products through the YDesign Group’s online
platform. See “—Our Strategies—Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment
_from Group integration and the Acquisition”._

##### Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages will be:

**_Leadership position in a fragmented market with highly attractive growth prospects_**
We estimate that we are one of the leading global design companies by revenue in the
fragmented high-end lighting and furniture design markets, with €526.1 million in total
revenue, Adjusted EBITDA of €128.7 million and net profit of €22.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. We believe that on a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, we would have
been approximately 1.5 times larger than our closest competitor in terms of revenues based on
our analysis of publicly available financial data for 2019. According to the Industry Report, after
contraction in the market due to COVID-19 pandemic, strong signs of rebound have been
witnessed, with the market expecting to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021.

In addition, despite the recent signs of a trend towards consolidation in the office space, the
high-end design market is primarily characterized by smaller competitors, making us one of the
few design groups that can serve a diverse customer base across a variety of product and service
categories and geographies, enabling us to benefit from cross-selling initiatives and giving us the
opportunity to grow through selected strategic acquisitions in the segments where we currently
operate or in complementary adjacent segments. See “Our _Strategies—Pursue_ _strategic_
_acquisition opportunities that align with our overall goals and objectives”._

**_Diversified business model across product categories, geography and distribution channels with_**
**_low customer concentration risk_**
Our business is diversified across product categories, geographies and distribution channels. We
currently operate in two product category sectors, lighting and furniture, which generated 61.8%
and 38.2% of our revenue from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2020,
respectively.

Geographically, our business benefits from a diversified reach, with approximately 140 countries
served and no one country generating more than 13.6% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020. Customers outside of our home geographies of Italy and Denmark generated
approximately 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, with non-European
sales representing 30.6% of our revenue for such period. Customer growth in recent years has
been primarily driven by the North America and the APAC region, with these regions generating
14.4% and 14.7% of our revenue for such period. We expect the APAC region and North America
to support rebounding from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to continue to
drive growth, with consistent demand also expected in our home geographies and Western
Europe. We also expect the Acquisition will increase our revenue from customers in North
America by providing access to YDesign Group’s large database of more than 800,000 customers,
of which approximately 250,000 were active in the past 24 months, including architects and
interior designers that are key specifiers in this geography. On a pro forma basis for the
Acquisition, we estimate that our revenues in North America for the year ended December 31,
2020 would have been approximately 32% of our revenue from contracts with customers.

We also benefit from a diversified distribution network comprised of four distribution channels
(wholesale, contract, DOS and direct online sales) enabling us to reach a broad range of
customers in a cost-efficient manner. Our diversified distribution network will further benefit
from the creation of our new e-commerce platform, which will be unified across our brands, and
the Acquisition, which will further foster our online distribution channel and our exposure to the
North American market where we estimate, based also on industry report, that online
penetration of the U.S. home furnishings market will increase from approximately 20% in 2018
to more than one third in 2023.

For further details on our distribution channels, see “—Omni-channel distribution network
_optimizing client reach and maximizing brand strength”._

151


-----

Finally, in addition to a diversified mix of product categories, geographies and distribution
channels, we benefit from low customer concentration risk. For the year ended December 31,
2020, Flos’ top 20 customers generated 14.4% of Flos’ revenue, with no one customer generating
more than 2.5% of Flos’ revenue, and Louis Poulsen’s top 20 customers generated approximately
22.0% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue, with no single customer generating more than 4.4% of Louis
Poulsen’s revenue. During the same period, B&B’s top 20 customers generated approximately
24.2% of B&B’s revenue, with no single customer accounting for more than 2.1% of B&B’s
revenue.

**_Highly resilient portfolio of iconic designs and breakthrough innovations_**
Our internationally-acclaimed product portfolios represent a balance between timeless heritage
designs and innovative products. Certain iconic designs have become synonymous with our
brands and continue to attract significant customer demand decades after being introduced. We
believe that maintaining these products in our portfolio helps to limit the effect of market trends
and improves our revenue resiliency. Numerous products from each of our brands have received
prestigious international design awards, including the Compasso d’Oro, NYCxDesign Award, IF
Gold Award, FX Interior Design Awards, Danish Design Award and German Design Award, and
are held in the permanent collections of art and design museums such as the Victoria & Albert
Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris
and La Triennale di Milano in Milan, confirming the excellence, renown and appeal of our
designs.

In addition, we believe that the balance between iconic and innovative products in our portfolio
also translates into limited concentration risk in terms of revenue, with the thirty products
representing the top ten best-selling products from each of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B
generating in aggregate only approximately 30% of our revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In particular, for the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from Flos’ top
ten best-selling products accounted for approximately 33% of Flos’ revenue, with no one product
representing more than approximately 6% of Flos’ revenue, and revenues from Louis Poulsen’s
top ten best-selling products accounted for approximately 32% of Louis Poulsen’s revenue, with
no single product representing more than approximately 8% of Louis Poulsen’s revenues. During
the same period, revenues from B&B’s top ten best-selling products accounted for approximately
25% of B&B’s revenue, with no product accounting for more than approximately 5% of B&B’s
revenue. Many of our products also benefit from high product longevity, with designs from as
early as 1925 continuing to be popular and informing the development and production of new
designs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our iconic products (i.e. lighting products
designed before 1980 and furniture products designed before 2000) accounted for approximately
22% of our revenue.

Our internal research and product development teams work closely with our designers to
continually update and reconfigure iconic pieces to meet the evolving needs and tastes of our
customers while maintaining the identity of each of our brands and the distinctive original
features that loyal customers worldwide have long associated with our products. We also launch
new products on an ongoing basis to complement our portfolio of heritage designs. We estimate
that we generated 36.1% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the sale of
products which each of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen introduced during the last five years.
Between 2018 and 2020, Flos, LP and B&B launched approximately 16, 14 and 22 new products
(including extensions of existing product lines) on average per year, respectively. Our efforts in
research and product development and innovation in both design and technology ensure both
the longevity of our iconic products and the continued introduction of creative and successful
new designs.

**_Omni-channel distribution network optimizing client reach and maximizing brand strength_**
We operate our brands through four distribution channels: wholesale, contract, DOS and direct
online sales. We believe our omni-channel distribution network optimizes client reach and
maximizes the strength of our brands. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the wholesale
channel generated approximately 73.3%, the contract channel approximately 19.7%, the DOS

152


-----

network approximately 6.2% and direct online sales approximately 0.8% of our revenue from
contracts with customers, respectively. On a pro forma basis for the Acquisition, we estimate that
our online sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been approximately 22% of
our revenue from contracts with customers.

_Wholesale_
Within the wholesale channel, we sell Flos products through approximately 2,300 third-party
dealers, Louis Poulsen through 1,650 third-party multi-brand points of sale and B&B’s products
through 59 mono-brand stores, 32 shop-in-shops and 781 multi-brand stores spread around the
globe. These include brick-and-mortar sales points and online third-party dealers, in a range of
formats from third-party mono-brand stores to shops-in-shops, corners and displays located in
third-party multi-brand stores. The wholesale channel enables us to increase customer reach
while limiting distribution costs. We benefit from long-standing customer relationships within
our wholesale channel, with many of our dealers having sold products from our respective brands
for five years or more.

_Contract_
Our contract channel gives us the opportunity to interact with a separate consumer demographic
that is not typically accessible through traditional retail outlets, such as those in the hospitality,
retail, residential design and office industries. Among some of the notable recent projects
completed by the Contract division are the One Thousand Museum by Zaha Hadid Architects in
Miami, The Polaris Lounge by Studio SCB Chicago, the Bulgari Hotel in Shanghai, Beijing and Milan
by Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel, The Retreat at Blue Lagoon Iceland by Basalt Architects and
Design Group Italia, the Aman Canal Grande hotel in Venice, the Café Royal, the Bulgari Hotel and
the Me Hotel in London, the Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan, the Peninsula Hotel in Paris, the
executive offices of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in Abu Dhabi and the Aman Amanera
hotel in Santo Domingo. We believe the wide variety of commercial customers and the larger scale
of contract projects make our contract channel a strong vehicle for cross-selling opportunities,
increasing the visibility of our products and our market penetration. Although a large proportion
of contract work is currently driven by B&B, the combination of our brands has provided us with
the opportunity to broaden the scope of our contract work, offering a floor-to-ceiling contract
service encompassing furnishings from B&B, kitchens from Arclinea and lighting solutions from Flos
and Louis Poulsen. The D-Studio initiative will further develop this integration by providing “softcontract” solutions to both B2B and B2C customers through specific points of sales.

_DOS_
Our DOS distribution channel is a powerful marketing tool that drives brand awareness, allows full
control over our brands and often provides enhanced visibility to our end customers. As of
December 31, 2020, Flos and B&B operated a total of five and ten DOS, respectively, and Louis
Poulsen had seven showrooms (which while not operated as points of sale, are an important
vehicle for driving sales, as customers who visit showrooms are encouraged to make purchases
through the Louis Poulsen e-commerce site using sales terminals located in each showroom), all
located in key luxury markets around the world in cities such as Milan, London, New York, Paris,
Tokyo and Hong Kong. In addition, as part of the integration process of our brands, we have
recently also broadened the range of products on display at certain of our DOS, featuring, for
example, selected Louis Poulsen and/or Flos lighting solutions in B&B DOS, thereby increasing crossselling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such products. DOS and
directly-operated showrooms are a highly valuable distribution channel as they not only drive sales,
but also increase brand strength, serving as a hub for marketing events and design fairs. Additional
contribution to our existing DOS network will come from the D-Studio initiative which is expected
to launch its first stores in Milan and Copenhagen over the course of 2021 and from the marketing
of Fendi-branded products which we expect will rely on a dedicated store network.

_Direct Online Sales_
While currently only utilized in select markets by Flos and Louis Poulsen, we believe direct online
sales represent a strong growth opportunity for us. Although B&B does not currently conduct any

153


-----

direct online sales, the new e-commerce platform which we expect to launch during the course
of 2021 will provide an integrated back-end solution powering different websites for all the
brands of the Group. In addition, the Acquisition is expected to provide an additional platform
for the distribution of our products in North America and particularly B&B products which are
currently not sold through the YDesign Group platforms.

Each of our brands also benefits from a strong digital channel and social media presence, which
supports brand awareness across all of our distribution channels and supports earlier customer
acquisition, as compared to traditional sales channels. B&B’s corporate website, bebitalia.com,
received an average of 1.3 million visits each month in the year ended December 31, 2020. Flos
launched a new corporate website in December 2017, which received a Digital Design Award (a
recognition awarded by an international jury for the best of Italian digital design) for Best
Corporate Website and being named SiteInspire’s Site of the Week and which in the first three
months of 2021 received approximately 362 thousand unique visitors each month on average,
which represents a 26% increase compared to the monthly average for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In addition, our brands have enhanced ther presence on social media in
recent years, with large fan bases and followers across all the main platforms, including
Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Twitter.

**_Unique brand power based on design heritage, iconic products, long-standing relationships with_**
**_top designers and loyal networks of specifiers in local markets_**
Our business benefits from significant competitive advantages that make our business model
difficult to replicate, including our iconic product portfolio, design heritage, long-standing
relationships with top designers and specifiers and strong technical know-how. Our iconic brands
benefit from association with a broad base of prestigious and globally renowned designers, such
as Philippe Starck, Antonio Citterio, Jasper Morrison, Patricia Urquiola, Piero Lissoni, Barber &
Osgerby, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Konstantin Grcic, Vincent Van Duysen, Marcel Wanders
and Michael Anastassiades at Flos, Poul Henningsen, Vilhelm Lauritzen, Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl
and Verner Panton at Louis Poulsen and Antonio Citterio, Naoto Fukusawa, Jeffrey Bernett,
Studio Kairos, Massaud, Gaetano Pesce, Buratti, Piero Lissoni and Vincent Van Duysen. We believe
our privileged relationships with such designers and our ability to attract new promising
designers represent a significant competitive advantage. Our relationship with designers is
mutually beneficial, as it allows us to expand our brand recognition across a wider customer
demographic and adds value for the designers, who gain prestige and visibility by working with
leading furniture and lighting brands. Some of our designers have collaborated with our brands
for many years, creating a strong design relationship and mutual understanding of the needs and
preferences of our customer base. Many of our designer partners have received multiple awards
and recognitions for their designs and have their designs held in the collections of museums
around the world. For more information on our contractual arrangements with designers, see
“Our Business—Flos—Agreements with Designers”, “Our Business—Louis Poulsen—Agreements
_with Designers” and “Our Business—B&B—Agreements with Designers”._

Designers collaborate closely with our internal research and product development teams, which
have accumulated extensive technical expertise and industry knowledge over decades and
continually support our design innovation. The research and product development teams add
substantial value to designers, providing an extensive knowledge base on product feasibility with
respect to design, materials and market success; research on the latest trends, materials and
technological innovations; design and development support for concepts, prototypes and molds;
negotiation support with suppliers to ensure high component quality standards at competitive
prices; and centralized assembly process and production planning. In addition, management
teams at each of our brands ensure that any new design that is being proposed or considered
internally is fully consistent with the relevant brand’s image and philosophy, which we believe is
key to the success of any product and the continued integrity of our brands.

In addition to our ability to attract and maintain relationships with world-renowned designers to
create unique pieces for our product portfolio, we also benefit from strong relationships with a
widespread network of specifiers, especially smaller, committed professional design and
architecture studios that continually choose and promote our products to meet the design needs

154


-----

of their clients. We consider these specifiers, which we define as any party that is involved in the
purchasing decision but is not the end user of our products, including but not limited to
architects, interior designers, lighting engineers and landscape architects, a loyal and resilient
customer intermediary that, through repeat business, provides us with a significant competitive
advantage locally in the geographic markets we serve and add to our recognition with end
customers.

**_Strong financial profile with proved resiliency and cash generation during the COVID-19_**
**_outbreak_**
Our brands have demonstrated business resilience throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, as
evidenced by our 2020 end-of-year results. Our total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2020 were €526.1 million and €128.7 million, respectively, marking a 6.9%
decrease and a 1.2% increase with respect to the year ended December 31, 2019. As a producer
of high-end design products, we believe our retail end customer base has significant disposable
income and tends to be less affected by the economic cycle than customers in other segments. In
addition, over the last year we have put in place specific initiatives to increase our economic
resiliency, mainly reducing discretionary spend and other costs associated with activities that
were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel and marketing related expenses,
including as a result of the cancellation of fairs and other events, and reducing our fixed costs by
outsourcing certain manufacturing processes to carefully selected third-party assemblers. We
believe that we may continue to benefit from some of these initiatives, in particular those
relating to the digitalization of our marketing activities, also after the end of the pandemic. In
addition, we have continued to pursue an increasing diversification of our business, with the
most relevant country only accounting for approximately 13.6% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2020. The introduction of LED products has also resulted in reduced
operating costs for Flos and Louis Poulsen over the last few years, while at the same time
improving the duration of the underlying products.

Our strong cash generation has historically been driven primarily by high profitability levels and
low capital expenditure. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased during the COVID-19
outbreak, from 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 24.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. At the same time, our cash generation has continued steadily throughout
2020, with adjusted net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities) decreasing from
€667.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €632.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. In this context, the Acquisition is expected to further strengthen our
resiliency and financial profile, given YDesign strong growth performance in the year ended
December 31, 2020 (despite COVID-19 outbreak, net sales and Adjusted EBITDA increased by
10.2% and 11.0%, respectively) and our exposure to the growing U.S. online high-end design
market.

Our business is characterized by limited capital expenditure requirements, with capital
expenditures as a percentage of revenues representing only 4.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2020. We expect our maintenance capital expenditure requirements as a
percentage of total revenues to remain broadly in line with such level. However, in light of our
strong cash generation performance in the past two years and the resiliency of our business
during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to increase our growth-related capital expenditures in
the next few years to achieve better access to end customers, and further strengthen our
leadership position in the market. In particular, we expect such increased investments to focus
on, among other things, actions to accelerate the digital transformation of the Group (e.g.,
implementation of the new e-commerce platform and the update of the Group’s enterprise
resource planning (ERP) and enterprise performance management (EPM) systems) and common
initiatives among the brands to strengthen our distribution in selected growing markets. See
“—Our Strategies”. For more information on our capital expenditures, see also “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditures”._

In addition, a significant part of our production, in particular that associated with our furniture
solutions, is typically made to order. The make-to-order approach we adopt for a large portion of

155


-----

our products enables us to maintain control over the value chain. In addition, where we do not
operate on a make-to-order basis, the long lifespan of our products lowers inventory risk.
Moreover, approximately 54% of our cost base is variable for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In addition, we believe that our brand strength gives us strong pricing power, typically allowing
us to pass the effects of increased raw material and component costs or adverse exchange rate
fluctuations to our customers.

**_Experienced_** **_management_** **_team_** **_backed_** **_by_** **_a_** **_strong_** **_holding_** **_structure_** **_and_** **_committed_**
**_shareholders_**
All the Group companies operate under the strategic guidance of the management and of the
board of directors of Design Holding. At Design Holding level, our former Chief Executive Officer
Gabriele Del Torchio will remain with the Group as non-executive Chairman, continuing to
contribute to the development of our business. A search for a new Chief Executive Officer of
Design Holding is ongoing and will follow the most rigorous international standards. Design
Holding has also recently reinforced its holding structure through the hires of a centralized
management team in charge of overseeing the overall operations of the Group and coordinating
with each operating company. Such team will include a Group Chief Digital Officer, Group Head
of Contract, Group Head of Marketing, Group Head of Human Resources, Group Head of
E-commerce and Group Head of China. All of our recently hired personnel have long-standing
experience and proved track-record in their respective fields. See “Management”. Additionally,
the executive teams at Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B are highly experienced in leading and
growing successful design businesses, with relevant prior experience at large international
companies. We expect that, as part of the Acquisition, certain members of the current
management team of YDesign will reinvest a portion of their respective proceeds into U.S. BidCo,
corresponding to approximately 2% of its issued and outstanding equity interests. See
“Summary—The Transactions—The Acquisition”.

This experienced management team is backed by our principal shareholders, Investindustrial and
Carlyle, each of which has successfully invested in the design and luxury industries both in Europe
and worldwide. We believe that our current management team and ownership structure will
allow us to continue to attract and retain the industry’s top talent, further driving profitable
growth. See “Principal Shareholders”.

##### Our Strategies
The key elements of our strategy are:

**_Expand our geographic reach especially in selected growing markets_**
As part of our initiative to grow our store network, we plan to also strategically expand our
geographic reach in markets where we expect to see continued growth, particularly outside of
Europe. We aim to expand the reach of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B within North America and
the Asia Pacific region (“APAC”). Moreover, expansion in China is one of our strategic priorities
and, to that end, we have appointed a Group Head of China who will oversee the commercial
efforts in the region, including the opening of local stores, the roll-out of mono-brand stores
with local partners and a digital-led marketing strategy to generate brand awareness and
support distribution of products in the area. In addition, the Acquisition is expected to further
foster our market penetration in North America, which will give us access to YDesign Group’s
large database of more than 800,000 customers, including architects and interior designers that
are key specifiers in this geography. See also “—Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that
_align with our overall goals and objectives”._

**_Develop our store network and foster growth of our online segment_**
As part of the integration process of our brands, we have recently broadened the range of
products on display at certain of our DOS, featuring, for example, selected Louis Poulsen and/or
Flos lighting solutions in B&B DOS in an environment designed to enhance the design identity of

156


-----

each brand while at the same time emphasizing the relationship among the products, thereby
increasing cross-selling opportunities by giving our customers the opportunity to purchase such
products. In addition, we are developing the D-Studio initiative consisting of the creation of
multi-brand and multifunctional flagship stores representing unified points of sales where all
products will be sold individually or through tailor-made projects providing “soft-contract”
solutions for B2C and B2B customers. The D-Studio pioneering initiative aims at maximizing the
cross-selling potential among our brands. We expect the first D-Studio stores to open in
Copenhagen and Milan over the course of 2021, which might be trailblazers of additional
D-Studio stores in the future. We expect to continue to grow our store network through the
recently-launched joint venture partnership with Fendi, which contemplates the opening of a
large network of dedicated DOS for the sale of Fendi-branded design products manufactured by
us. In addition to the above, we are currently planning the roll-out of our new e-commerce
platform which we expect to be initially launched with Flos before the end of 2021 to target the
main markets in continental Europe and the U.K., to then expand to the other Group companies
and geographies. Finally, the Acquisition is expected to further expand our online segment and
strengthen our presence in the North American market. After giving pro forma effect to the
Acquisition, we estimate that the portion of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020
represented by online sales would have been approximately 22%. In addition to online sales, we
intend to continue to develop digital relationships with our existing and potential customers,
including through online marketing, social media outreach, online sales support, digital product
configurators and partnering with social media influencers to promote our products and
visibility.

**_Continue to strengthen and extend our product portfolio_**
Our product portfolio is a key element of our success, and we intend to continue to invest in
research and product development with the aim of further strengthening and extending this
portfolio both with redesigns or new configurations of existing products and introductions of
new, complementary designs. We intend to continue adapting to evolving technology while
building on the strength and success of our timeless iconic products. We expect to continue to
launch new products and to coordinate our marketing and advertising efforts through a single
and pre-defined strategy for the Group. Between 2018 and 2020, Flos, LP and B&B launched
approximately 16, 14 and 22 new products (including extensions of existing product lines) on
average each year, respectively, a rate of new product launches that we expect to continue.

**_Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment from Group integration and the_**
**_Acquisition_**
Our key operational priority, along with maintaining and improving our high quality standards,
is to finalize the deployment of synergies from the creation of Design Holding. Management
estimates a potential €6.0 million of expected run-rate annual revenue and cost synergies
positively impacting our Adjusted EBITDA in the medium-term. In particular, revenue synergies
include estimated incremental annual run-rate EBITDA of €4.7 million we expect to generate in
2022 from sales from our two D-Studio stores that we plan to open during 2021 and sales of our
products on the centralized e-commerce platform that we plan to launch in 2021. Cost synergies
include estimated run-rate annual cost savings of €1.3 million from initiatives that we have
already started implementing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, related to the
transfer of the production of selected architectural products of Flos and Louis Poulsen to our
Spanish facilities and the opening and recent renovation of the Arclinea headquarters and
training center in Caldogno, in northeastern Italy. We also expect to achieve €3.2 million of
additional annual run-rate revenue synergies from the Acquisition, which we expect to fully
realize in 2022, mainly deriving from (i) sales on the YDesign platform of our products, including
B&B products which are currently not sold by YDesign and (ii) revenues from the sale of
YDesign’s private label products which YDesign is currently considering to set up in categories
which we do not expect to compete with the Group products. For additional information,
including on expected minor one-off costs and capital expenditure which are not reflected in

_Financial and Pro Forma Data”._

**_Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that align with our overall goals and objectives_**
Our global footprint and diverse product portfolio create opportunities for acquisitions of
selected brands in the high-end design market or adjacent markets that may bolster or
complement our existing offering and geographical footprint. We are open to considering and
we constantly scrutinize additional strategic acquisitions, some of which could be significant in
size, to add to our portfolio, capitalize on our competitive strengths, expand our geographic
footprint and reach in jurisdictions, including outside of Europe, where we see potential growth
opportunities and/or where we currently have limited operations, further diversify our product
offering, preserve or improve our financial performance and/or benefit from further
consolidation expected in the design industry. Any further potential acquisition opportunities
will be evaluated in light of a prudent and rigorous analysis to preserve a strong financial
position. We will continue to apply a disciplined approach to pricing in connection with these
potential acquisitions and will place significant emphasis on carefully planning and executing our
acquisition strategy. As part of this strategy and to the extent possible, we will aim to use the
investments we have already made in our IT, finance, operational, governance and business
processes to reduce costs associated with on-boarding acquired businesses and will aim to utilize
these synergies to benefit the entire Group.

**_Continue to leverage and nurture our relationships across the design value chain_**
In addition to our long-standing relationships with top designers that form a key competitive
advantage, we also benefit significantly from positive relationships with loyal specifiers,
particularly from the architect and designer community serving the local markets where we are
present. These specifiers raise our profile and support our success across the value chain from the
creation of the designs, to the development of the products and the final distribution to
customers. We intend to continue fostering these long-standing relationships, which in turn
support our ability to attract and retain new designers and promote our products to new
specifiers. We believe that operating as a single one-stop-shop under one joint strategic direction
will enable us to increase our ability to attract new talents and enhance the visibility of our
brands. See “—Drive operational excellence and finalize synergy deployment from Group
_integration and the Acquisition”._

##### The Group’s Business

We design, produce, distribute and sell high-end lighting and furniture solutions, bringing
together three companies with leading positions in the global high-end design market: Flos, an
Italian lighting producer, Louis Poulsen, a Danish lighting producer, and B&B, an Italian furniture
producer.

We operate and conduct our business through these three complementary companies, thus
offering a broad range of product categories and brands across multiple sales channels and
geographic areas. Furthermore, while the Issuer is a holding company with no operations on its
own, the management team that oversees the operations of the Group is employed by Design
Holding. For more information on the Group’s structure and management, see “Summary—
_Corporate Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Management”._

##### Design Holding

Since our incorporation in 2018 in connection with the acquisition by Investindustrial and The
Carlyle Group of Flos, Louis Poulsen and B&B with the goal of creating a global high-end design
group that brings together a collection of renowned and complementary brands, we have played
a key role in coordinating these three businesses, by generating cost and revenue synergies and
expanding the Group’s customer reach and product portfolio, with the goal of creating a
one-stop shop for high-quality design furniture and lighting products for both individuals and
businesses around the world.

158


-----

From a governance perspective, we underwent a major change, by transitioning from a
founder-led to a management-led group with new CEOs been appointed at each of Flos and
B&B. Moreover, the governance of the Group has been further strengthened by coupling the
governance teams at each of Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen with a centralized management team
at the level of Design Holding (including the Group CEO, the Group CFO, the Group Chief Digital
Officer and the Group Head of Contract, Head of Marketing, Head of E-commerce, Head of
Human Resources, Head of China and Head of Retail) in charge of overseeing the overall
operations of the Group and coordinating with each operating company.

In order to further leverage our potential synergies in the Contract division, we set up a crossbrand task force coordinated by the Group Head of Contract to discuss industry trend and
coordinate joint activities on a bi-weekly basis.

From an operational perspective, we launched a centralized customer relationship management
(CRM) platform, thus administering the interactions with customers in a more efficient way,
leveraging the data gathered by each Group company. This initiative, which we completed in
2020, allows our Contract sales organizations at each of Flos, B&B and LP to coordinate with each
other and in the different geographical areas in which we operate. In 2021, we expect to also
launch a direct e-commerce platform coordinated by the Group Head of Digital, which will
enable our customers to purchase products from all of our brands on one joint website.

##### Flos

Flos is one of the world’s leading producers of high-end lighting solutions for residential and
commercial use. Flos was founded in Merano, in northern Italy, in 1962 by Arturo Eisenkeil, in
partnership with the Cassina family. Only two years later, Flos introduced the Arco lamp, which
would go on to become one of its most iconic and best-selling lamp designs. Flos transferred its
headquarters to Brescia, in northern Italy, in 1964, opened its first store in Milan in 1968 and
expanded internationally in 1971 with the opening of its first foreign branch in Germany. In
1974, Flos acquired the heritage Italian lighting brand Arteluce, significantly expanding its
product range and international reach. Flos began its exclusive collaboration with Philippe Starck
in the 1980s, and throughout the 1990s, Flos unified its divisions into a unique brand catalogue
and continued its global expansion into North America and Asia. The contract business was first
introduced in 1996, in response to growing demand from commercial customers. In 2000,
following its participation in the first International Light & Building fair, Flos launched its
architectural business, Flos Architectural, which represented its first venture into lighting for
commercial spaces. The Architectural business was significantly bolstered with the acquisition in
2005 of a majority stake in Antares, a Spanish commercial lighting producer based in Valencia,
Spain. In 2016 and 2020, Flos received its fourth and fifth Compasso d’Oro awards for the lamps
“OK” by Konstantin Gric and “Arrangements” by Michael Anastassiades, respectively. In addition,
in 2020 Flos received also the first career award for the “Arco” lamp. Investindustrial acquired a
majority stake in Flos in 2014. In 2015, Flos acquired the New York City-based custom lighting
producer Lukas Lighting, further strengthening the company’s presence in the custom sector, and
Italian outdoor lighting company Ares, which allowed Flos to expand into outdoor lighting. In
2017, Flos began a rebranding of a portion of the Ares catalogue, introducing its first “Flos
Outdoor” collection, and acquired Flos Projets (formerly KKDC S.à r.l.), a French distributor of
LED lighting products, supporting its distribution capacity in the area. In 2018, Investindustrial
and The Carlyle Group acquired Flos (along with Louis Poulsen and B&B) with the goal of
creating a global high-end design group that brings together a collection of renowned and
complementary brands.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Flos generated revenues of €203.7 million and
€231.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €54.9 million and €61.3 million, respectively. Flos’
revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented 39.0% and
42.7% of the Group’s consolidated revenues from contracts with customers and revenues related
to Design Holding that are generated by each brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations and

159


-----

adjusted EBITDA for such year, respectively. Flos operates an international business, with its
products sold through a network of approximately 2,300 third-party dealers around the world, in
addition to five flagship stores located in Milan, Rome, Paris, Stockholm and New York and a
directly operated e-commerce site in the U.S.

**_Business Divisions_**

The business of Flos comprises four divisions: Decorative, Architectural, Custom and Outdoor.

_Decorative_

The Decorative division offers high-end consumer lighting products, such as the Arco floor lamp
by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, the Superloon floor lamp by Jasper Morrison, the
Noctambule lighting solutions by Konstantin Grcic and the Arrangements collection by Michael
Anastassiades, primarily for residential applications. The Decorative division, which represents the
original business of the company as established in 1960, forms the core of Flos’ product offering
and is managed by Flos S.p.A. The Decorative division is primarily managed from the company’s
headquarters in Brescia, and the production of Decorative products is mainly outsourced to a
selected number of trusted manufacturers, primarily in Italy. The Decorative division product
offering is broad and consists of more than 1,500 different products (including different
configurations of the same product and excluding spare parts).

_Architectural_

Flos’ Architectural division was established in 1996 in response to growing demand for highprofile commercial lighting products and is managed by Flos’ subsidiary Antares in Valencia,
Spain. The Architectural division provides lighting products primarily for sophisticated, high-end
commercial applications including retail stores, hotels, offices and outdoor markets, and, from
time to time, luxury residential properties. Previous commissions include providing lighting for
large international groups such as Ferragamo, Versace, Inditex, Armani, Nespresso and D&G.
Approximately 10 to 20% of Flos’ Architectural products are assembled at the Antares plant in
Valencia. Flos expects that the level of production of architectural products at the plant in
Valencia will further increase, as a result of the plan to transfer part of the architectural
manufacturing from Denmark to Spain. The Architectural division product offering is also broad
and includes approximately 7,000 products (including different configurations of the same
product and excluding spare parts).

_Outdoor_

Following the acquisition of Italian outdoor lighting producer Ares in 2015, Flos began
incorporating Ares products into its catalogue, resulting in the launch of the first Flos Outdoor
collection in 2017. Production of Flos Outdoor is managed by Ares in Bernareggio, in northern
Italy. The Outdoor collection is designed for open spaces and aims to strike a balance between
complementing the existing architecture and blending into the landscape. The Outdoor division
comprises approximately 3,300 products (including different configurations of the same product
and excluding spare parts).

_Custom_

The Custom division delivers custom-made lighting solutions for commercial and residential
applications and is mainly managed by the Flos subsidiary Flos Bespoke S.r.l. (formerly Light
Contract S.r.l.) in Collebeato, in northern Italy, and the Custom division of Flos USA Inc., in the
U.S. Although the Custom division is a relatively small component of Flos’ business, it might be an
entry point for new customers who first come into contact with Flos lighting in retail, hospitality
or other commercial environments and provides cross-selling opportunities for all other business
divisions. The Custom division’s capabilities range from the personalization of standard
collections with special finishes and light sources to the custom-tailoring of high performance
products and the customized production of unique solutions for large-scale projects, where each
device is designed and developed according to the most challenging architectural needs.

-----

**_Design_**
Since it was established in 1962, Flos’ business model has relied on iconic design coupled with
technological innovation. Flos’ Decorative line has since the 1960s been developed internally
through partnerships with some of the most world-renowned designers and architects, including
Philippe Starck, Antonio Citterio, Jasper Morrison, Patricia Urquiola, Piero Lissoni, Barber &
Osgerby, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Konstantin Grcic, Vincent Van Duysen, Marcel Wanders
and Michael Anastassiades. Flos’ unique designs have been recognized globally through
numberless of design awards, including five Compasso d’Oro (for the “Parentesi” lamp by Achille
Castiglioni and Pio Manzù in 1979, for the “May Day” lamp by Konstantin Grcic in 2001, for the
“OK” lamp by Konstantin Grcic in 2016, and for the “Arrangements” collection by Michael
Anastassiades in 2020), two ADI Compasso d’Oro Lifetime Achievements for Sergio Gandini
(1995) and for Piera Pezzolo Gandini (2011), six-time winner of the best lighting product at the
EDIDA Awards (in 2008 for the “Skygarden” lamp by Marcel Wanders, in 2010 for the softarchitecture fixture “Wallpiercing” by Ron Gilad, in 2014 for the “String Lights” by Michael
Anastassiades, in 2015 for the “Superloon” lamp by Jasper Morrison and in 2018 for its collection
“Arrangements” by Michael Anastassiades, and in 2020 for the “Noctambule” collection by
Konstantin Grcic), and best product of the year by the FX Interior Design Awards 2017 for its
innovative professional lighting system Infra-Structure by Vincent Van Duysen. Various designs
are also held in the collections of prestigious design museums worldwide, including the Museum
of Modern Art (MOMA) and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Victoria & Albert
Museum in London, Le Centre Pompidou in Paris and La Triennale di Milano in Milan. See
“—Agreements with Designers” for information on Flos’ contractual arrangements with its
designers.

The creation of Flos products is the result of an integrated process involving designers, architects
and the internal research and product development department at every stage, with 42 full-time
employees dedicated to research and product development as of December 31, 2020. Designs
begin at the concept stage, in which designers either propose their own ideas for designs or
produce concepts for designs that Flos has requested. The concept stage is followed by a period
of research, in which designs are further developed and modelled, materials are selected, and
products undergo initial engineering. During the refining stage, the product is developed as a
prototype and undergoes a second round of engineering and analysis against safety standards.
The product then moves to the defining stage, in which final engineering takes place, the
product is measured against internal and external quality standards and arrangements are made
for production logistics and the supply of raw materials. Finally, the product moves to the
production stage, which encompasses the procurement of raw materials, production planning
and the final manufacturing of the product.

**_Production_**
The majority of Flos’ production operations benefit from a flexible supply chain, with a focus on
lean operations. Due to the complexity of the techniques and materials required for the
manufacture of Flos’ products, production is mostly outsourced to carefully selected
manufacturers, with a majority of production on a make-to-order basis. Within the Decorative
and Architectural divisions, manufacturing is primarily outsourced and assembly is almost entirely
outsourced. Production levels of Decorative products are based on a forecast of sales volumes at
stock keeping unit (“SKU”) level which is normally made on a yearly basis, but such forecast is
then adjusted on a monthly basis throughout the year based on actual demand with a very short
lead time, as Decorative products (as well as certain readily available Architectural products) can
usually be delivered in approximately two to four days. In the Architectural division, production
is done on order; within the Outdoor division, manufacturing is entirely internal and assembly is
almost entirely internal, with production taking place to order. Custom products are tailored to
each customer’s satisfaction and are entirely custom-made, with custom projects taking up to
several months to be completed, depending on the size and complexity of the project.

161


-----

**_Supply Chain Management_**

Although a majority of production is outsourced, Flos remains directly involved in the
manufacturing process, with quality control assessments taking place during every step of
production. Prior to being sent to assemblers, raw materials and product components undergo an
initial round of quality control, during which Flos (or the third-party assembler, in the case of
products assembled outside of Italy) utilizes specialized quality control software to run quality
controls on a statistical basis, the frequency of which varies depending on the specific type of
material or component. The raw materials and components are then either assembled internally
or packaged into assembly kits and sent to third-party assemblers. Flos generally contracts with
assemblers that are located in close proximity to its headquarters in Bovezzo and members of its
internal quality control organization make regular visits to assemblers to gauge the assemblers’
quality control procedures. During the assembly phase (both internal at Flos and external at the
third-party assembler), quality controls are performed on every product and the outcome of each
quality control test is collected by Flos through its quality control software. Assembled products
are then returned to Flos, where products undergo a further quality control assessment on a
statistical basis to ensure that they meet internal and external standards of quality and safety,
while adhering to the original design principles, before being stored in Flos’ warehouses and
shipped to customers as required. In addition, the first production run of new products are
always assembled internally, so that Flos can then share best practices with its external
assemblers.

Flos contracts with a diverse group of non-exclusive suppliers to provide the raw materials,
assembly and finished products it requires. Suppliers are carefully selected mainly according to
their technical capacity, quality, finance reliability and cost and are usually located in close
proximity to Flos’ facilities to minimize transportation costs and timing. Flos contracted with over
650 suppliers in 2020.

The relationships between Flos and its suppliers are governed mainly through (i) purchase orders
with general terms and conditions specifying the purchase process, the general terms of delivery
of purchased materials, the terms of invoicing and certain general obligations of the suppliers;
(ii) standard supply agreements or (iii) framework supply agreements specifying terms,
termination rights and minimum quantities. Flos also requires its suppliers to adhere to a set of
guidelines provided by the company concerning the quality and any technical requirements of
the products. If materials or products are found to be defective, Flos can return them to the
supplier to be replaced or repaired at the expense of the supplier.

**_Marketing_**

Flos’ marketing efforts are coordinated across channels, media and distributions around four
areas of focus: (i) brand experience, (ii) sales support, (iii) B2B relationships and (iv) customer
relationships.

Brand experience is a key element underlying all of Flos’ marketing efforts and is structured
around four core objectives: (i) creating an omni-channel brand with a strong and distinctive
style able to be effectively deployed across all media channels, (ii) telling a story that engages our
audience, (iii) establishing a consistent and unique statement of brand and (iv) maintaining an
approach across all channels that is scalable and cost-effective. Flos’ brand experience has been
bolstered over time with the launch of its new global corporate website in December 2017,
which received multiple international design awards (including a Digital Design Award for Best
Corporate Website and SiteInspire’s Site of the Week) and which in 2021 has received
approximately 362,000 unique visitors each month on average, which represents a 26% increase
compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Flos also plans to launch a new corporate
websites for the Chinese market in the next two years. Brand experience also plays a key role in
the launch of new products. For example, for the launch of the Arrangements lighting system by
Michael Anastassiades in April 2018, Flos’ marketing department designed an omni-channel
promotional suite, with leaflets, photo shoots, designer interviews, videos and an interactive
product configurator on the company website, all designed to convey a consistent brand

162


-----

experience. Combined with social media promotions and internal sales support, this coordinated
approach led to a successful new product launch, with over 4.9 million customers reached across
various media within two months of launch.

Sales support is also a key element of Flos’ omni-channel marketing strategy. Flos’ nearly 80
online dealers worldwide are an important part of its international distribution network. Flos
also supplies significant sales support to its brick and mortar (“B&M”) dealers through the use of
third-party sales platform Hubspot, which was launched in May 2018 and enables Flos to improve
its sales performance from digital generation of leads. Once a sales lead is collected in the
landing page of Flos’ website, an email is automatically generated to the relevant country
manager, who directs ownership of the lead to a specific salesperson. That salesperson then
contacts the lead directly, either by phone call, email or another method of communication.
Since Flos began using Hubspot, it has developed a database of over 60,000 leads (as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum) that can be directly actioned by the appropriate salespeople,
significantly improving its ability to convert leads to clients. Flos has also focused its sales support
efforts on building a dedicated program for trade customers (e.g. architects, professional interior
designers, lighting designers and professional stagers), with membership in the program
providing such advantages as complimentary shipping, a trade discount, additional opportunities
for engagement (e.g. through learning series, partnership events and personal shopping
experiences), access to expert consultants for architectural solutions and the ability to order
custom products.

In addition to the sales support provided to all online and B&M dealers, Flos is developing special
marketing channels for its B2B customers, including the launch of a professional website that is
easy to navigate and dedicated to the needs of B2B customers. The website is a channel that is
completely dedicated to Flos’ network of professionals, and it is devised, designed and
constructed to replicate the intimacy that is typical of our showrooms and in person
relationships. The website also includes special content from Flos Studios, which produces
content and short videos featuring international lighting influencers, architects and interior
designers who have had experience working with Flos, as well as case histories of new product
applications in the Architectural division, complete with overviews of products, solutions,
technical specifications and design process. Combined with the website is a new newsletter
program dedicated to B2B customers, a special web landing page and events and presentations
with renowned architects and designers exclusively for B2B customers.

Flos has completed the implementation of Salesforce, the new Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) platform dedicated to the B2B channel, which is currently used in most of
the countries in which we operate. For more information on the adoption of a Group CRM
platform see “—Design Holding”.

Customer relationships are key to Flos’ success and brand reputation, and continuing to build and
maintain these relationships, particularly through digital channels, is a key element of Flos’
marketing strategy. Flos’ social network accounts have one of the largest fan bases among Italian
design companies, with a fan base of approximately 900,000 followers across its social media
accounts as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn,
Pinterest and Twitter). The Flos corporate website also receives significantly high traffic,
recording approximately 3.4 million visits in the year ended December 31, 2020. While continuing
to maintain its presence across all channels, Flos is currently focusing its marketing efforts on
augmenting its digital channel, with the primary goal of increasing its ability to interact with its
audience without an intermediary.

**_Distribution Network_**
Flos operates an extensive international distribution network, with five flagship stores located in
Milan, Rome, Paris, Stockholm and New York and approximately 2,300 third-party B&M dealers in
70 countries worldwide. The table below provides a breakdown by geographic region of number
of Flos’ B&M dealers for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Flos primarily sells directly to retail customers through its network of flagship stores and through
its e-commerce site in the U.S. The remainder of Flos’ international distribution is primarily
conducted by its network of B&M dealers and by wholesalers and distributors which on-sell Flos’
products to their customers. Flos distributes inventory to its B&M dealers in one of two ways,
based on what is most appropriate for the dealer and the geographic region: (i) directly to the
dealer (approximately 60% of dealers) or (ii) through a direct subsidiary (approximately 40% of
dealers). Sales leads may be generated either directly by Flos’ internal salesforce or by third-party
agents, depending on the features and commercial practices of each market. Flos contracts with
its international dealers using a standard commercial customer agreement, which provides for
the terms of delivery and payment, as well as base discount from the standard purchase price for
all products purchased by the dealer under the agreement. Flos provides its retailers with a list of
recommended retail prices for its products, although retailers are not contractually bound to
apply such prices. Moreover, Flos sells its products through a network of over 80 third-party
online dealers, including YDesign.

**_Customers_**
Flos serves a wide range of customers, including design-conscious individuals, architects, interior
designers, other design professionals and wholesalers and distributors of design lighting
products. Flos also serves high-end fashion brands, retail stores, hotels and other businesses
primarily as part of its Architectural division. Flos’ B&M dealers are primarily high-end interior
design shops dealing either exclusively in lighting or in a combination of furnishings and lighting.

**_Intellectual Property_**
Flos has developed a dedicated strategy to improve the protection of its intangible assets and
enforce the underlying intellectual property, which primarily consists of trademarks, designs,
copyrights, utility models and domain names. Flos owns a large portfolio of Italian, European and
other international trademarks, including for the name “Flos”. In addition to registered
trademarks, Flos also owns several de facto trademarks covering the names of its products and
product lines. Flos also owns more than 600 registered designs, primarily registered in Italy, the
European Union, the U.S., China, Japan and India, covering the shapes of certain products. Flos’
portfolio of patents, primarily registered in Italy and the European Union, provides additional
protection for the inventions inherent in certain of Flos’ products. Flos also seeks to protect its
company know-how through the use of non-disclosure agreements. Flos contracts with a thirdparty service responsible for monitoring and removing any intellectual property used without
permission on websites, e-commerce platforms and social media, while also regularly conducting
its own trademark surveillance. For more information on risks related to our intellectual property
rights and efforts to protect them, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we are
_unable to protect our license and other intellectual property rights from others, or if_
_counterfeiting increases, our business may suffer, and we may incur significant additional costs”._

164


-----

Additional intellectual property rights are governed by Flos’ license agreements with individual
designers. See “—Agreements with Designers”.

**_Agreements with Designers_**
As of December 31, 2020, Flos was party to 245 license, transfer and/or assignment agreements
with Italian and foreign designers in connection with the design of lighting products, all
providing for the payment of consideration to the designers for the use or transfer of their
intellectual property rights. These agreements can be divided into two broad categories:
(i) intellectual property transfer agreements providing for the complete assignment of
intellectual property rights from the designer to Flos and (ii) license agreements with Flos as
licensee. Most of the transfer agreements grant to Flos all of the rights arising from any potential
future versions of products that could be developed by the designer counterparty without need
to enter into further agreements and expressly grants Flos registration rights with respect to the
designs. Flos has entered into approximately 30 license agreements. These agreements typically
do not include exclusivity clauses, and some of them do not expressly provide Flos with the right
to register intellectual property rights with respect to the designs, allowing the designers to
freely grant intellectual property rights not covered by the license agreement to third parties.
Pursuant to most of its license agreements, Flos is required to make quarterly payments to the
relevant designers in amounts that are calculated on the basis of net sales, whether in Italy or
abroad, net of any discounts, return of unsold goods, shipping charges, as well as any other
expenses arising out of and in relation to such sales. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Flos
paid a total of €3.4 million in royalties to designers. Flos’ license agreements are typically openended in duration, with termination clauses generally in favor of the designer, allowing the
designer to terminate at any time with notice.

**_Information Technology_**
Flos has a centralized information technology infrastructure based in Italy for its global
operations. Flos’ centralized infrastructure increases efficiency in the use of software and
hardware, enhances product support and cost control and, ultimately, leads to economies of
scale. In particular, initiatives have been taken and others are being taken to outsource repetitive
and low-added value IT services, whereas IT services that are suitable for innovation, business
processes reengineering and employee productivity increase have been kept in-house. Such
strategy also aims to facilitate the use of common processes and data structures throughout the
business and to ensure data consistency and timely data availability for managing Flos’ business
operations. Flos’ IT department is composed of two main functions: Infrastructure & Networking
and Application Development. As of December 31, 2020, Flos’ IT department consisted of six
internal full-time employees and five external on-call consultants, the former equally distributed
among the two mentioned functions, the latter mainly focused on the Applications Development
function. Flos is in the early stage of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system, which is expected to be adopted across the Group companies operating in the lighting
business and is aimed to automate certain business functions and to streamline the operational
process, thus resulting in a saving of time and resources.

##### Louis Poulsen

Louis Poulsen is a leading global high-end lighting brand with an iconic portfolio focused on
Danish design heritage. Originally founded in 1874 as an electrical wholesale business, Louis
Poulsen began its transition to a design-driven lighting producer in 1924, when the company
began its collaboration with iconic Danish designer Poul Henningsen, with the resulting
collection of “PH” lamps distributed through agents in Europe and North America. Throughout
the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Arne Jacobsen, Vilhelm Lauritzen and Verner Panton designs were added
to the product portfolio, cementing Louis Poulsen’s reputation as a leader in the field of Danish
industrial design. In 1999, a consortium led by Danish private equity firm Polaris acquired Louis
Poulsen and split the business into Wholesale (which at the time accounted for the majority of
sales) and Lighting divisions, with joint management and operational functions. The Wholesale
division was sold in 2005 and the Lighting division continued as Louis Poulsen. Beginning in late

165


-----

2005, a new management team began repositioning the company toward a more focused,
high-end market by pruning the product portfolio, investing in new product development and
expanding the B2C business. Louis Poulsen was then sold to Targetti, an Italian architectural light
fixtures company, in 2007. The products and sales organization remained under the Louis Poulsen
brand in the Nordic region, Japan, Germany and the U.K., while in the U.S. operations and
manufacturing were merged under the brand Targetti Poulsen and in the rest of Europe and
Asia, distribution was fully merged under the Targetti brand name. In addition, the manufacture
of outdoor in-ground fixtures, previously based in the U.K., was moved to Targetti’s
manufacturing facilities in Italy. Following a period of declining B2B sales under Targetti
ownership, Polaris again acquired a majority stake of 69% in Louis Poulsen in 2014 and instituted
a new management team that overhauled local sales organizations, creating a more cohesive,
global sales organization with an increasingly aligned focus on the decorative market.

Since 2014, management has renewed focus on product innovation, focusing on LED or LED
compatible products, and has invested significantly in production and design, increasing the rate
of new product launch from four or five new products per year between 2011 and 2015 to 14
new products or extension of existing product lines per year between 2018 and 2020. In 2018,
Investindustrial and The Carlyle Group acquired Louis Poulsen (along with Flos and B&B) with the
goal of creating a global high-end design group that brings together a collection of renowned
and complementary brands. Louis Poulsen now operates a robust global distribution network,
with 1,650 third-party multi-brand points of sale in over 70 countries and 86 sales consultants in
15 markets (including direct subsidiaries in 11 markets). Louis Poulsen also has dedicated directly
managed showrooms, located in Fort Lauderdale (Florida), Oslo, Copenhagen, Vejen (Denmark),
Dusseldorf, Tokyo and Singapore, which showcase Louis Poulsen designs as well as hosting
marketing events, for example in connection with the launch of new products. Louis Poulsen will
be part of the rollout of the D-Studio multi-brand and multifunctional flagships in Copenhagen
and Milan, which we expect will open in 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,
LP generated revenues of €122.3 million and €112.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of
€30.7 million and €24.5 million, respectively. LP’ revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the year
ended December 31, 2020 represented 23.4% and 23.9% of the Group’s consolidated revenues
from contracts with customers and revenues related to Design Holding that are generated by
each brand, gross of adjustments and eliminations and Adjusted EBITDA for such year,
respectively.

**_Business Divisions_**

Louis Poulsen’s operations are divided into two business divisions: B2C, which comprises sales of
high-end lighting solutions to residential customers through third-party multi-brand points of
sale and the Louis Poulsen online store, and B2B, which comprises sales of indoor and outdoor
lighting solutions for professional projects. The products sold within the B2B division can be
broken down into Indoor and Outdoor product divisions, with a single B2B sales team handling
both Indoor and Outdoor product sales. Product lines generally overlap between the B2C and
B2B divisions, with most Louis Poulsen products sold via both divisions, although certain products
(e.g. large outdoor fixtures such as post tops for street lamps) are normally sold only through the
B2B division.

Louis Poulsen’s business divisions are supported by a global network of 86 directly-employed sales
consultants, third-party agents and distributors. Although Louis Poulsen primarily depends on its
own directly-employed sales consultants, in certain markets third-party agents or distributors are
considered more customary or efficient, based on the features and the commercial practices of
each market. For example, Louis Poulsen commonly uses third-party agents in the U.S. (supported
by directly-employed sales consultants), where third-party agents are customary and using them
is considered more efficient than using directly-employed sales consultants.

_B2C_
Although originally focused on B2B sales, over the past several years Louis Poulsen has
increasingly focused on the B2C channel.

166


-----

Although focus within the B2C channel was historically on traditional bricks and mortar retailers,
most of these retailers have now opened web shops, thereby increasing Louis Poulsen’s available
market beyond the geographical regions where its products are sold in retail stores. Louis
Poulsen has also successfully increased its presence with online retailers, such as Lumens, Royal
Design, Design Within Reach, Iabelfarm GmbH, Connox GmbH and nest.co.uk. Louis Poulsen has
also operated its own e-commerce website in Denmark for many years, and in 2017 added
e-commerce in Sweden, Norway and Germany. A new web platform with improved aesthetic and
search function was introduced in 2018, followed by a directly operated BTC e-commerce
platform, which is currently available across Europe and the U.S.; moreover, a new and updated
partner portal dedicated to BTC was introduced in 2020 and made available across Italy,
Germany, Sweden, France and Spain.

Within its third-party B2C multi-brand points of sale, Louis Poulsen products are displayed
according to one of three store types, which essentially reflect the extension (in terms of square
meters) of the Louis Poulsen dedicated area in each store: (i) shop-in-shop, which is an in-store
branded area with parameters defined by Louis Poulsen in terms of size and appearance;
(ii) corner, which is similar to a shop-in-shop but tends to be smaller; and (iii) display, which is a
small in-store setup where a few selected Louis Poulsen products are displayed, often with
limited advertising material or a special stand. Displays also include stores that have no specific
in-store Louis Poulsen setup but may display Louis Poulsen fixtures within a multi-brand sales
environment.

When contracting with a new third-party multi-brand point of sale, Louis Poulsen conducts a
careful review of the quality of the outlet, in terms of brand position, product assortment and
service level. Once a contract is in place, sales representatives from Louis Poulsen will periodically
visit these third-party multi-brand points of sale to ensure that the standards are upheld. In
addition, Louis Poulsen representatives often use incentives, such as applying product discounts
or sharing the costs related to joint marketing initiatives, to encourage store managers to expand
their offering of Louis Poulsen products or to upgrade the Louis Poulsen dedicated area in their
store (e.g. from a display to a corner or from a corner to a shop-in-shop). Various factors
determine whether the cost of the physical set-up of the area within each store where Louis
Poulsen products are displayed is borne by Louis Poulsen or by the point of sale owner, including
standard practices in the relevant market.

Since 2014, management has been focused on supporting and expanding the global B2C
customer portfolio, targeting three key strategies: (i) increasing revenue from the existing point
of sale network, (ii) expanding the point of sale network and (iii) building a streamlined and
effective sales and marketing organization. In order to increase revenue from the existing point
of sale network, management focused on both introducing new product families and extending
existing product lines, in addition to providing the incentives discussed above to increase the
offering of Louis Poulsen products and upgrade the Louis Poulsen dedicated area at existing
points of sale. Several of the new product families introduced in recent years target the
underpenetrated affordable luxury segment, balancing the existing portfolio offering of
primarily luxury products and enabling Louis Poulsen to reach a new category of customers
previously unlikely to purchase its products. In addition, existing lines were extended with new
finishes and formats and limited editions produced in order to revitalize iconic products and
simultaneously renew interest in original versions. Moreover, 316 of Louis Poulsen’s retailers have
been upgraded from 2018 to the date of this Offering Memorandum, with new in-store concepts
introduced to support increased sales per store. Over time, Louis Poulsen has also engaged in a
global store rollout, expanding into 387 new points of sale between 2018 to the date of this
Offering Memorandum through a combination of increased penetration of existing markets and
entering new markets. Finally, an increased focus on building sales and marketing functions led
to the establishment of dedicated B2C sales organizations serving the U.S., the U.K., Asia,
Finland, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, with the result that all markets in which Louis Poulsen
is present now have dedicated B2C sales organizations. Louis Poulsen also benefits from an
internal marketing division, composed of a team of 18 full-time employees specialized in
marketing activities and four local marketing employees in Germany, the U.S., Japan and

167


-----

Singapore. Management intends to continue focusing on marketing with increased investment in
digital channels. See “—Marketing”.

_B2B_
Louis Poulsen’s B2B business comprises sales through specifiers in professional projects, such as
architects, developers, lighting designers, interior designers and building engineers, of both
indoor and outdoor lighting solutions. The B2B business includes both decorative lighting, which
focuses on statement pieces with strong design elements, and general design lighting, which is
focused on simpler solutions for commercial spaces that are primarily functional while still
maintaining the minimalist Danish design that characterizes all Louis Poulsen products.

The B2B division key focus areas are: (i) accelerated development of new products, (ii) aligning
and improving sales efforts and (iii) reorganization of sales teams in the key markets of the
United States, Central Europe and Singapore. The B2B division has benefited from an increased
investment in product development of decorative products in the B2C division, as both sales
channels have common themes and the accelerated product development program has primarily
been focused on Indoor decorative and general design lighting products that are distributed
across both sales channels. In the Indoor division, numerous new products were launched during
the last few years, comprising both updates to heritage products, such as new finishes or formats,
and newly designed products, and additional products are in the pipeline. Although product
developments in the Outdoor division have also been accelerated, we normally experiment a
significantly longer development phase for outdoor products compared to indoor ones. Sales
functions have also been enhanced to support the increased rate of product launches. Our
customer relationship management system enables performance management of sales
consultants and the results have been used to develop a sales excellence initiative aimed at
increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our salesforce by way of, for example, adopting
different sales strategies based on the various customer types.

**_Design_**
Louis Poulsen’s distinct design philosophy originates from Poul Henningsen’s ambition to give
electrical light similar ambient properties as the candlelight it replaced in the early 20[th] century.
With that goal in mind, Louis Poulsen has always sought not to design lamps, but to shape light.
The company’s philosophy of “Design to Shape Light” guides the design of all of its products,
meaning that no design details are added to a lamp that do not have a justification in function,
softening luminance and eliminating direct glare and hard shadows, in line with the design
principle that “Form Follows Function”. All of Louis Poulsen’s lighting designs are characterized
by an aesthetic, a function and an ambience that define the space in which they are used, while
simultaneously blending in with the surroundings. Louis Poulsen designs have been awarded
numerous prestigious design awards, including the 2018 IF Gold Award for the Yuh lamp by
GamFratesi, the Danish Design Award, Dansk Industri og Danish Design Center award, the
Lighting Design Award, Revo Media award and the Design Award, Bo Bedre for the Flindt wall
and several other Danish Bo Bedre Design Awards for Lamp of the Year, for the Patera lamp by
Øivind Slaatto among others, and are collected by design museums around the world, including
the Danish Design Museum.

Louis Poulsen’s design philosophy is strongly rooted in Danish design heritage. Since its first
collaboration with Poul Henningsen in 1924, Louis Poulsen has expanded its influence through
partnerships with the most celebrated designers in Danish design history, eventually acquiring
intellectual property rights to some of the most famous lighting designs of the “big 5” of Danish
industrial designers: Poul Henningsen, Vilhelm Lauritzen, Arne Jacobsen, Finn Juhl and Verner
Panton, which remain at the core of Louis Poulsen’s offering. The company believes that the
sense of quality and Scandinavian design heritage that this core collection represents has
contributed to attracting other high-profile Scandinavian and international contemporary
designers, such as Bjarke Ingels, GamFratesi, Louise Campbell, Øivind Slaatto, Alfred Homann, Oki
Sato and Olafur Eliasson, to collaborate with the company, ensuring that the heritage designs are
continually updated to reflect modern technologies, tastes and lifestyles and are complemented

168


-----

by a range of innovative new designs. See “—Agreements with Designers” for information on
Louis Poulsen’s contractual arrangements with its designers. Whether recently developed or part
of the core collection, all of the Louis Poulsen designs incorporate the company’s philosophy of
“Design to Shape Light” and the simple, timeless expression that is core to Danish design.

**_Production_**

Louis Poulsen utilizes a highly scalable operating model, based on an institutionalized,
commercially-driven design process, a well-invested production setup with an increasing share of
outsourcing and a majority of sales activities conducted through its own global salesforce.

_Production cycle_

Louis Poulsen’s production follows a cycle revolving around two main product launch phases,
Spring (February to April) and Fall (September and October), during which new products are
formally marketed and sold to end-customers. Each market launch phase is preceded by a
corresponding internal preparation phase (November to January and May to June), during which
the salesforce deploys marketing content to wholesalers and sells them new products internally,
the supply chain is engaged based on demand estimates and the production lines are prepared
accordingly and extended, to the extent required. On the sales side, prior to launch, new
products are previewed with new and existing customers, who provide feedback to the
marketing team to further refine demand estimates, and sales teams are brought in-house to
refresh their general sales training and receive specialized training on new products. In the B2B
channel, production of custom products is initiated in collaboration with the architects and
designers acting as specifiers on the relevant project. In the B2C channel, immediately prior to
launch, the sales teams communicate details of the new products to external customers and use
social media and other marketing channels to generate interest around the products. During the
official launch phase, the marketing team prepares content for the launch, while the new
products are distributed to customers and subsidiaries and customer service and technical
specifications are prepared.

Overall product development is guided by a five-pronged product strategy of new launches, line
extensions, product updates, product modifications and custom designs. New launches comprise
newly-designed products and re-launches of heritage designs, either through the reintroduction
of designs that were previously produced and have been discontinued or the new introduction of
heritage designs that were previously acquired but have not yet been produced, as well as
existing product line extensions. Examples of recent new launches include OE quasi, PH septima,
Keglen. Line extensions represent additions to an existing product family, such as through new
colors or finishes, additional sizes or new lamp types (e.g., creating a pendant version of a floor
lamp, or a table version of a pendant lamp). Recent line extensions include Pantella portable, PH
artichoke in brass and black. Product updates include upgrades to reflect new technical
specifications, such as the upgrade of certain heritage designs to accommodate LED technology.
Finally, product modifications and custom designs are undertaken on a case-by-case basis in order
to reflect customer requirements, either for an adjustment of an existing design in the case of
product modifications or through the design of an entirely new custom product to meet
customer specifications. The volume of development within each category is strategically
adjusted to account for market trends, technological advances, seasonal selling patterns and
customer requirements, with each launch cycle representing a varied concentration of product
launches of each type.

_Supply Chain Management_

Louis Poulsen sources raw materials and components for its products from approximately 225 to
250 suppliers. Louis Poulsen primarily sources raw materials and components that it does not
have the capacity or volume to produce internally, such as cast aluminum, polycarbonate items,
mouth-blown glass and electrical drivers. A small number of Louis Poulsen suppliers are
considered key to its operations due to their expertise and ability in manufacturing sophisticated
high-end materials, such as mouth blown glass.

169


-----

Whilst maintaining low input prices is important to Louis Poulsen, a few of the raw materials
used, such as steel, copper and plastic, may be subject to global price volatility. Louis Poulsen
does not normally hedge against this risk and believes it has historically been able to pass any
such price increases onto customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If prices of
_the raw materials we employ in our manufacturing processes or of the components or finished_
_products we purchase were to increase, our business could be adversely affected to the extent we_
_are not able to pass any such price increases on to our customers”. Louis Poulsen maintains a high_
standard of quality control throughout the manufacturing process, with a dedicated internal
quality department that inspects raw materials, components and products at all stages of
manufacturing and assembly to ensure that they conform to standards. In addition, Louis Poulsen
employs a dedicated quality control manager to inspect and monitor the quality of products
produced by its production partners in China.

_Manufacturing and distribution_
Louis Poulsen manufactures its products primarily internally, at the company’s plant in Vejen,
Denmark. The Vejen plant employs about 263 staff members working on two shifts and has four
main buildings used for production, a mechanic workshop, a paint shop, an assembling
department, storage for raw material and finished products and offices. Production and logistics
flow seamlessly through the Vejen plant beginning at the metal shop, a mechanic workshop with
capabilities for grinding, spinning, welding, punching and deep drawing that primarily processes
sheet metal (steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper and brass). Product components are
transferred from the metal shop to the paint shop, where they undergo three separate processes:
(i) a seven-stage pre-treatment system, (ii) a powder paint system with two spray-boots and (iii) a
wet paint system with four spray-boots and a hardening oven. Once painted, the product
components are transferred to an assembly area that is organized around 40 U-shaped assembly
cells. In the assembly area, products are not only assembled but also tested and packaged,
followed by order confirmation and transportation to the finished goods warehouse, where
finished products are stored alongside components and products sourced from third-party
suppliers. In addition to the main warehouse in Vejen, Louis Poulsen operates three additional
distribution centers in the United States, Japan and Singapore to support global sales. European
sales are primarily served from the Vejen warehouse, which also supports export activities to
Africa, the Middle East and South America. The regional distribution centers ship products
directly to retailers and architectural projects, ensuring high responsiveness and short delivery
lead times. The warehouse in the United States supports North and Central America and Canada,
the warehouse in Japan supports Japan and the Singapore warehouse supports the rest of the
APAC region, including Korea.

Although most Louis Poulsen products are produced internally, the B2B portfolio has historically
been supplemented by a small number of complementary third-party products, which were
generally used to fill gaps in Louis Poulsen’s B2B product portfolio and enabled the company to
deliver more technical lighting fixtures for both indoor and outdoor projects. However, due to
Louis Poulsen’s sharpened focus on design philosophy and a more targeted product range, the
use of third-party products has decreased in recent years and is being gradually phased out.

**_Marketing_**
Prior to Polaris’ acquisition of Louis Poulsen in 2014, marketing was solely focused on traditional
print media advertising and catalogue production, with a minimal marketing team consisting of
a single director supported by two graphic designers. Since 2014, management has invested
significantly in the marketing operation, increasing the size of the marketing team to 18 full time
employees as of December 31, 2020 and implementing an ambitious reorganization of brand
management and communication methodologies. In particular, substantial investment has been
made in digital channels and tools, including through the establishment of a digital team
comprising seven full time employees, supporting an integrated brand, marketing and online
sales effort, and management continues to focus on investments in the digital channel. Other key
projects that were realized include a stronger articulation of the brand’s core design principles, a
process model for the product pipeline and an integrated and consistent campaign management

approach, as well as developing the “shop-in-shop” retail concept. This focus on building up a
strong and skilled marketing organization reflects the company’s ambition to deliver a seamless
customer experience across channels and to make Louis Poulsen into a digitally-led lifestyle
brand, inspiring the way that its customers’ lives are shaped by design and light.

Louis Poulsen’s marketing efforts are built around three dimensions: (i) brand management and
storytelling, (ii) business development and supporting the sales organization and (iii) retailers.
Marketing efforts across all channels are designed to communicate the story of the brand’s
distinct design and brand philosophy of “Design to Shape Light” and focusing on the brand’s
Danish design heritage and commitment to the timeless properties of iconic Danish design. The
business development and sales organization utilizes digital tools to coordinate efforts
surrounding both internal preparations for and external launches of new products, as well as to
streamline business relationships between the company’s salesforce the end customers and Louis
Poulsen. In addition, Louis Poulsen launched a new “shop-in-shop” store concept in 2016,
improving store presence through enhanced visibility of the Louis Poulsen brand and supporting
retailers by providing an easy-to-implement branded area with specified size and appearance.
Providing these stores with branded designs also helps Louis Poulsen to align its brand universe
across retailers.

The digital transformation in the marketing sphere enabled Louis Poulsen to explore numerous
new marketing possibilities and extend its global reach without incurring significantly increased
marketing costs. Louis Poulsen has more than doubled the number of its followers on Instagram,
from 150,000 followers in September 2018 to 345,000 followers in March 2021 and increased also
the number of its followers on Facebook from 65,000 to 82,400 over the same period. While
social media continues to be a primary focus of Louis Poulsen’s marketing efforts, print media
remains part of the marketing strategy of Louis Poulsen, with print advertising campaigns in
luxury design-focused publications such as Elle Décor and Wallpaper focusing on introducing new
products and revitalizing heritage designs, through segment-neutral photography focused on
brand, design and the product and be appealing to both B2B and B2C customers. Louis Poulsen
also publishes its own proprietary magazine, Reflections, which is available online as well as in a
printed version, and is sent to Louis Poulsen’s e-commerce website customers and distributed in
all of Louis Poulsen’s physical points of sale and showrooms. Reflections includes editorial
storytelling about Louis Poulsen, new launches and campaigns in inspiring interior settings,
introductions of Louis Poulsen designers and articles on various topics in the design and lighting
technology fields. The content of the magazine is also coordinated with themed web landing
pages and newsletters distributed to B2B customers. Louis Poulsen also has seven showrooms
where potential customers can experience the Louis Poulsen lighting universe. Showrooms are
also utilized to stage new product launches, host professional events and facilitate order intake
from retailers, as customers may purchase products from tablet computers that are displayed
throughout the showroom, while sales assistants are on hand to provide assistance. Showrooms
currently exist in Fort Lauderdale (Florida), Oslo, Copenhagen, Vejen (Denmark), Dusseldorf,
Tokyo and Singapore. Louis Poulsen will be part of the rollout of the D-Studio multi-brand and
multifunctional flagships in Copenhagen and Milan, which we expect will open in 2021.

**_Customers_**

Louis Poulsen serves a diverse range of customers across its B2C and B2B sales channels. Louis
Poulsen’s most important customer categories in the B2C market are high-end interior design
stores (such as Design Within Reach and Paustian), department stores (such as Illums Bolighus and
Hyunday, Korea), lighting specialist stores (such as Lysmesteren and Christiania Belysning) and
pure online retailers (such as Lumens, Royal Design and nest.co.uk) where Louis Poulsen is able to
leverage its strong brand and extensive product portfolio.

Louis Poulsen’s B2B business comprises sales through specifiers in professional projects, such as
architects, lighting designers, interior designers and building engineers, of both indoor and
outdoor lighting solutions. Over the past five years, Louis Poulsen’s B2B division has partnered
with leading architects such as BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group), Henning Larsen Architects, KHR

171


-----

Architecture, PLH Arkitekter and Kilo Design in a variety of professional projects across the
education and government, business, retail, hospitality, healthcare, residential and other
commercial sectors, while the vast majority of B2B Outdoor end-customers are public entities.

At a customer level, sales at Louis Poulsen are highly diversified, with the top 20 customers
accounting for only approximately 22% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020,
with no one customer accounting for more than 4.4% of total revenue.

**_Intellectual Property_**
Louis Poulsen has developed a dedicated strategy to improve the protection of its intangible
assets and enforce the underlying intellectual property, which primarily consists of trademarks,
designs, copyrights, and domain names. Louis Poulsen owns 34 registered designs, primarily
registered in the European Union, the U.S., Japan, China and Norway, covering various lighting
fixtures, as well as a large portfolio of Danish, European and other international trademarks,
including for the name “Louis Poulsen”. Louis Poulsen’s portfolio of patents, primarily registered
in through the Nordic Patent Service, provides additional protection for the inventions inherent
in certain of its products. Louis Poulsen has a zero tolerance policy for intellectual property
infringement and regularly enforces and prosecutes unauthorized use of its designs, trademarks
and other intellectual property, and each Louis Poulsen subsidiary is assisting with monitoring its
local market and reporting any instances of infringement. However, certain of its products and
designs may still be copied, and Louis Poulsen may not be able to prevent the production or sale
of all such copies. For risks related to intellectual property rights and efforts to protect them, see
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we are unable to protect our license and other
_intellectual property rights from others, or if counterfeiting increases, our business may suffer,_
_and we may incur significant additional costs”._

Additional intellectual property rights are governed by Louis Poulsen’s license agreements with
individual designers. See “—Agreements with Designers”.

**_Agreements with Designers_**
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Louis Poulsen was party to license agreements with
70 designers (or their legal representatives, in case of deceased designers) in connection with the
design of lighting products. These include agreements granting Louis Poulsen the exclusive
commercial rights to develop, manufacture, market and sell lighting designs by the “big 5”
Danish designers Poul Henningsen (rights to 128 designs), Arne Jacobsen (rights to 30 designs),
Verner Panton (rights to eight designs), Vilhelm Lauritzen (rights to 35 designs) and Finn Juhl
(rights to five designs). Louis Poulsen’s license agreements generally grant Louis Poulsen the
exclusive, non-revocable worldwide right to commercially exploit certain specified lighting
designs in exchange for royalties paid to the designer or the designer’s legal representatives,
generally set at a fixed rate per unit sold and reassessed annually to account for changes in
product prices. In general, licenses are granted for the duration of the validity of the copyright of
the design, which extends for 70 years after the death of the designer. The first of such licenses
to expire will do so in 2037. After the relevant expiry date, Louis Poulsen will still be able to
produce and sell the designs of such designers, but without exclusivity. In addition, Louis Poulsen
relies to a more limited extent on license agreements with other designers to complement its
heritage collection that have different terms. Although these license agreements do not have set
termination dates, most grant the designers the right to terminate the agreement should certain
minimum sales rates fail to be met over a specified period, or should Louis Poulsen significantly
reduce or cease production of certain products. Furthermore, license agreements can generally
be terminated by the designers or their legal representatives in the case of material breach, for
instance if royalties are not paid when due and following notice from the licensor. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our business is in part dependent on our ability to_
_negotiate, maintain and renew license agreements with leading designers on satisfactory terms”._
Based on the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, Louis Poulsen will pay a total of
€2.8 million in royalties.

Louis Poulsen currently uses a SAP (Systems Applications and Products in Data Processing)
enterprise resource planning software to manage all of its information technology needs
worldwide. This centralized infrastructure increases efficiency in the use of software and
hardware and enhances product support and cost control, which ultimately, leads to economies
of scale. It also facilitates the use of common processes and data structures throughout the
business and ensures data consistency and timely data availability for managing Louis Poulsen’s
business operations. As of December 31, 2020, Louis Poulsen’s IT department consisted of six
internal full-time employees.

##### B&B

B&B is one of the world’s leading producers of high-end designer furniture for residential and
commercial use. B&B was founded in 1966 by Pier Ambrogio Busnelli and Cesare Cassina and the
first factory began production in 1968. Originally called C&B (Cassina & Busnelli), the company
was renamed B&B Italia S.p.A. in 1973 following Mr. Busnelli’s acquisition of Mr. Cassina’s shares.
B&B has distinguished itself since its founding with its innovative industrial approach to
manufacturing, in contrast to the small, traditional artisan competitors that were typical of the
home furnishings sector at the time. For example, in 1968, B&B became the first company to
apply polyurethane extrusions to a metal skeleton in a mold, allowing for the production of
shapes and for consistency of quality that would not be achievable with traditional production
methods, and B&B’s iconic Coronado sofa became the first ever sofa produced using this method
in the same year. Based in Novedrate in northern Italy, B&B operates from a headquarters
designed in 1972 by the world-renowned architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers. B&B’s
products have made a rich contribution to the history of Italian design, with styles that represent
the union of creativity, innovation and industrial expertise. This approach has garnered B&B
numerous international design accolades, including four Compasso d’Oro prizes, the most
prestigious industrial design award in Italy. In 1989, B&B became the first company to win the
Compasso d’Oro in its own right, rather than for one of its products.

Investindustrial acquired 80% of B&B from the Busnelli family in 2015, and in 2016 B&B acquired
a controlling stake in the Italian high-end kitchen design firm Arclinea (currently wholly-owned),
creating a partnership that combined B&B’s innovative and design-led approach to home
furnishings with Arclinea’s established pedigree in creating modern kitchens that are both
functional and elegant. B&B continues to innovate in production and manufacturing techniques
and in 2016 became the first company in Italy to install the “Versalis offline” unit, a completely
automatic system for cutting leather. In 2018, Investindustrial and The Carlyle Group acquired
B&B (along with Flos and Louis Poulsen) with the goal of creating a global high-end design group
that brings together a collection of renowned and complementary brands. B&B now operates as
a global business, with points of sale in over 90 countries worldwide, ten flagship stores and over
800 authorized points of sale. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, B&B generated
revenues of €195.8 million and €213.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of €43.6 million and €41.7
million, respectively. B&B’ revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020
represented 37.6% and 33.9% of the Group’s consolidated revenues from contracts with
customers and revenues related to Design Holding that are generated by each brand, gross of
adjustments and eliminations and Adjusted EBITDA for such year, respectively. For the same
period, B&B generated approximately 83% of its revenues outside of Italy.

In recognition of its flagship status in the Italian design community, B&B was chosen as the
founding member of the Altagamma organization, an association of prominent Italian luxury
producers considered leaders in their fields and ambassadors for Italian culture and style
throughout the world.

**_Brands_**
The B&B group encompasses four brands: B&B Italia (including B&B Italia Outdoor), Maxalto,
Arclinea and Azucena. Each brand is distinguished by a unique design identity, while maintaining
the design pedigree, quality and precision that defines the B&B group.

_B&B Italia_

The B&B Italia brand was created in 1966 and comprises a full range of contemporary designer
home furnishings, with a focus on innovative contemporary design. The B&B Italia collection
includes sofas, chairs, tables, beds, wardrobes, office furnishings and decorative accessories, as
well as outdoor furnishings within the B&B Italia Outdoor line. B&B Italia’s products are
distinguished by their high-end design content, with a particular focus on innovation and
technology, and blend contemporary design with timeless taste. B&B Italia products are aimed at
highly design-conscious consumers who are able to recognize the brand directly through the
product itself. B&B Italia products are also notable for their consistently high quality, which is
achieved through primarily internal production, mostly taking place at the company’s main
manufacturing facilities in Novedrate and Misinto.

The first B&B point of sale was opened in New York in 1976. As of December 31, 2020, there were
ten directly operated stores, 32 shop-in-shops, 59 mono-brand stores 13 distributors and 704
multi-brand stores around the world, with a total of 67 points of sale in North America, 54 points
of sale in the Far East, 168 points of sale in Italy, 515 points of sale in the rest of Europe and 14
points of sale in the Middle East and the rest of the world. The vast majority of the total points
of sale as of such date, sold both B&B Italia and Maxalto products.

_Maxalto_

Established in 1975, the Maxalto brand is characterized by classical shapes revisited in a
contemporary style, with a focus on artisanal craftsmanship and superior woodworking. The
design of the collection, coordinated by the celebrated Italian architect and industrial designer
Antonio Citterio, is inspired by the romanticism of French design between the two world wars.

Maxalto products are aimed at sophisticated middle class consumers seeking a timeless product,
and in emerging markets particularly toward those looking for a classic, European style.
Production of Maxalto products is almost completely internal, taking place at B&B’s
manufacturing facilities in Novedrate and Misinto.

_Arclinea_

Arclinea began in 1925 as a family-owned woodworking shop, originally producing doors and
windows and eventually transitioning to the design and production of kitchens in the 1950s. The
first Arclinea kitchen debuted in 1958, and shortly thereafter Arclinea introduced the Claudia,
the first kitchen with built-in electrical appliances. Arclinea kitchens blend the materials, methods
and functionality of professional kitchens with modern design elements, meeting the practical
needs of home cooks while seamlessly blending with the design of the contemporary home. Since
1986, Arclinea has been in partnership with the Italian architect and industrial designer Antonio
Citterio, who has been responsible for many of Arclinea’s most recognizable and popular designs,
including the Italia, first introduced in 1988, the Artusi, first introduced in 1999, and the
Principia, first introduced in 2016. The B&B group acquired a majority stake in Arclinea in
September 2016 and subsequently acquired full ownership in 2019. Arclinea has continued to
invest substantial resources to renew its machinery, systems and software to pursue innovation,
quality and excellence.

During the 2018 Milano Design Week, Arclinea inaugurated its new flagship store in Via Durini,
Milan, and in 2019, it opened its new show room and training center in Caldogno.

_Azucena_

Azucena was founded in 1947 by Luigi Caccia Dominioni, Ignazio Gardella and Corrado Corradi
Dell’Acqua, with the aim to combine formal elegance, luxury and aesthetical purity, which has
resulted in a range of iconic pieces, such as the Catilina chair. B&B acquired Azucena in December
2017, with a focus to preserving its historical value by relaunching a series of “modern classics”
pieces that Luigi Caccia Dominioni has plotted since the late 1940s. Azucena’s catalogue includes
a selection of chairs, sofas, tables and lamps that symbolize the evergreen made in Italy design
and represent a cornerstone of style and quality.

174


-----

The Azucena collection is available in the main B&B mono-brand stores and in selected multibrand stores worldwide.

**_Business Divisions_**
The business of the B&B group is composed of three divisions: (i) the Home division, which
comprises retail and wholesale sales of B&B Italia and Maxalto products; (ii) the Contract division,
which comprises full “turn-key” fit-outs of commercial and residential properties using both
standard and custom B&B products, as well as third-party products, depending on the project;
and (iii) the Arclinea division.

_Home Division_
The Home division focuses on the production of high-end, design-focused furniture primarily for
residential applications, distributed to customers through both directly operated retail stores and
third-party wholesalers. This division represents the original conception of B&B as a producer of
contemporary high-quality furnishings and focuses on the sale of the B&B Italia (including B&B
Italia Outdoor) and Maxalto brands.

_Contract Division_
B&B’s Contract division delivers custom “turn-key” furniture solutions and finishes in the
residential, hospitality, retail and office sectors. The expertise that the Contract division has built
up over the years enables B&B to develop executive and technical projects for hotels, residences,
offices, theatres, shops, yachts and cruise ships. The Contract division offers high-quality, custom
furniture that is specifically designed, engineered and manufactured for each project, as well as
furnishings from the B&B catalogue and complementary items from third-party producers. The
materials, finishes, fabrics, leathers and coatings are conceived to meet the precise demands of
the contract, both in terms of function (e.g. ease of maintenance, comfort, fire safety and wear
and tear) and aesthetics. The Contract division manages complex orders through the entire
conception and production cycle, from design and logistics to supply and installation. The
activities surrounding the design, production, project management and logistics of large custom
projects are fully integrated within the Contract division to enable the efficient and effective
execution of contract projects while maintaining the constant pursuit of technical and design
excellence.

Contract projects are primarily split into two main categories: (i) complete fit outs, in which B&B
designs and fits out an entire interior space, including flooring, wallcoverings and furniture that
are all completely custom; and (ii) furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FFEs”), in which B&B
provides furnishings (either custom or from the standard catalogue) for an existing interior
space.

Among some of the notable recent projects completed by the Contract division are the One
Thousand Museum by Zaha Hadid Architects in Miami, The Polaris Lounge by Studio SCB Chicago,
the Bulgari Hotel in Shanghai, Beijing and Milan by Antonio Citterio and Patricia Viel, The
Retreat at Blue Lagoon Iceland by Basalt Architects and Design Group Italia, the Aman Canal
Grande hotel in Venice, the Café Royal, the Bulgari Hotel and the Me Hotel in London, the
Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan, the Peninsula Hotel in Paris, the executive offices of the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company in Abu Dhabi and the Aman Amanera hotel in Santo Domingo, as
well as a series of prestigious international projects in the cruise ship and office sectors.

_Arclinea Division_
Since B&B acquired a majority stake in Arclinea in 2016, it has continued to operate the business
as a separate legal entity and division but it has increasingly coordinated certain processes, such
as in the Contract and Retail distribution channels (among which the Arclinea DOS that B&B
operates in Paris and London).

**_Design_**
B&B’s strong relationships with international designers and its dedication to continual research
and product development have always been key factors in the strategic development of the

175


-----

company. The unique elements that comprise each product are the direct result of the ongoing
research, creativity and quality that characterize B&B. B&B has long been recognized for its iconic
designs, for which it has received numerous prestigious design prizes, including four Compasso
d’Oro prizes (for the “Le Bambole” sofa by Mario Bellini in 1979, for the “Sisamo” wardrobe
system by Studio Kairos in 1984, for the “Sity” sofa by Antonio Citterio in 1987 and for the
company itself in 1989). Over the past 50 years, B&B has collaborated with some of the world’s
most prestigious architects and designers, including Afra and Tobia Scarpa, Marco Zanuso, Vico
Magistretti, Paolo Piva, Barber & Osgerby, David Chipperfield, Doshi Levien, Michael
Anastassiades, Antonio Citterio, Gaetano Pesce, Naoto Fukusawa, Patricia Urquiola, Mario Bellini,
Zaha Hadid and many others. B&B currently collaborates with approximately 30 designers,
including Antonio Citterio, Naoto Fukusawa, Jeffrey Bernett, Studio Kairos, Massaud, Gaetano
Pesce, Buratti, Piero Lissoni and Vincent van Duysen. B&B’s products are collected by leading
design museums worldwide, including the Design Museum in London and La Triennale di Milano
in Milan. Over the years, certain products have become international icons, including the UP5_6
armchair, which is now recognized worldwide with different names, such as “Big Mama” and
“Blow Up” for its unique anatomical characteristics and unmistakable anthropomorphous
references.

B&B has two art directors, namely Mr. P. Lissoni and Mr. A. Citterio and its internal research and
product development team, comprising approximately 20 members, acts as a support network to
these designers, working side-by-side with the designers throughout the design process,
providing expert support on materials and production technology and enabling the designs to be
channeled into successful B&B products. In particular, to become part of any B&B collection, each
design must be consistent with the B&B brand philosophy and heritage, so that the B&B imprint
may be clearly recognized in any product. Management believes this is one of the key factors
that differentiates B&B from its competitors. See “—Agreements with Designers” for information
on B&B’s contractual arrangements with its designers.

**_Production_**
B&B maintains a constant focus on research and innovation of shapes and materials and the
creation of pioneering process technologies. For example, B&B was the first company in its
industry in Italy to apply polyurethane extrusions to a metal skeleton in a mold, which allows to
produce shapes with consistency of quality that would not be achievable with traditional
production methods. B&B’s manufacturing processes aim to maintain traditional handicraft
elements while applying them on an industrial scale. B&B’s products are primarily manufactured
in-house, which contributes to the superior quality that has become synonymous with the brand,
with raw materials and components supplied by a diversified group of providers with
longstanding relationships. However, part of the production (e.g. outdoor products) is
outsourced as needed in order to maintain optimum margins or when specific production
processes or materials are required. Production at each of the manufacturing facilities is on an
order-driven basis, with approximately four to six weeks of lead time for each order, in addition
to the time required for the delivery, which varies depending on the customer’s location. See
“—Real Estate—Production Facilities” for further information on our production facilities. During
the manufacturing process, each product is subject to quality control assessments that are
performed at various steps by the workers who are directly in charge of the relevant
manufacturing phase, as well as by dedicated quality control personnel who provide the final
authorization for the release and shipment of the product.

**_Supply Chain Management_**
B&B sources raw materials and components for its products from a diverse group of suppliers,
primarily located in Italy. Suppliers are carefully selected at the central level to ensure quality of
materials and availability of supplies. B&B benefits from long-term relationships with many of its
suppliers, primarily sourcing materials it does not have the capacity or volume to produce
internally, such as leather, fabrics, iron, plastics, wood, etc.

**_Marketing_**
B&B’s marketing focuses on both digital and physical marketing, through online and social
media, participation to events, print campaigns and public relations activities. The marketing
function is primarily organized by business division, although the marketing teams coordinate
their actions on a regular basis, including with the Group’s marketing team. In addition to
traditional print advertising in luxury lifestyle and design publications, B&B maintains a digital
presence that is broadly composed of six marketing tools:

- B&B website. B&B’s website, bebitalia.com, had an average of 1.3 million visits each month in
the year ended December 31, 2020. The website is currently available in six languages (Italian,
English, German, French, Spanish and Russian) and a Chinese version, bebitalia.cn, was
launched to boost online visibility in China, one of B&B’s most rapidly growing markets. In
addition, B&B’s marketing team is planning to launch a new corporate website to enhance its
brand recognition and prepare to benefit from the new e-commerce platform that is currently
being planned.

- Newsletter. B&B also publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, which it distributes to a network of
over 30,000 among architects, designers and press.

- Web advertisement. In addition to targeted Google advertising and search engine optimization
activity based on brand keywords (with B&B ranking third among the large furniture providers
in Italy, the U.S., U.K, France and Germany in terms of search engine activity), B&B’s web
presence is bolstered by its partnership with a variety of architecture and design websites and
portals, including Stylepark, Archiexpo, Archiproducts, Interior Design, Architizer and
Architonic (on which B&B is the second most visited furniture brand).

- Social networks. B&B maintains a strong presence on social media as well, with accounts and/or
fan pages on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, WeChat and Weibo.
B&B’s social network accounts consistently have one of the biggest fan bases among Italian
design companies, with over 443,000 followers as of December 31, 2020.

- Digital launches of products. B&B reacted to the limitations imposed by the pandemic by
adopting a webinar platform and presenting new products through digital channels, which
permitted to maintain direct contact with wholesales, mono-brand and flagship stores around
the world.

- Other digital public relations. In addition to maintaining its own social media accounts, B&B
has recently turned its focus to additional online public relation activities, including partnering
with influencers to create native-generated content and increase brand awareness and
reputation. These new collaborations led to increased contacts in the U.S and China, leveraging
on B&B brand and reputation.

**_Distribution Channels_**
B&B’s approach to distribution is to make the path from design and production to the end
customer as direct and efficient as possible in order to preserve and pass on to the customer a
product that represents the unaltered B&B brand identity. Architects and specifiers play a key
role at each stage of the distribution process. B&B’s distribution is broadly divided into three
channels: (i) retail, which comprises directly operated stores; (ii) wholesale, which comprises
mono-brand stores (all operated by third parties), shop-in-shops and multi-brand stores; and
(iii) contract, which comprises the delivery of custom products in B&B’s Contract division.

_Retail_
B&B operates a retail network of ten directly operated stores in Europe and the United States,
with locations in New York City (two stores), Washington D.C., Dallas, Miami, London, Munich,
Paris (two stores, of which one for Arclinea) and Milan. In 2019, Arclinea opened a new flagship
store in the hearth of Beaupassage, Paris, which is operated by B&B.

177


-----

_Wholesale_

B&B’s wholesale network comprises 59 mono-brand stores, 32 shop-in-shops and 781 multi-brand
stores spread around the globe. Some of these third-party retailers also have e-commerce
platforms. Mono-brand stores are similar to B&B’s directly operated retail stores in that they only
sell products from the B&B brands, but the stores are managed by third parties. Shop-in-shops are
in-store branded areas dedicated to B&B products within third-party retailers, with the size and
appearance of the display defined by B&B, and multi-brand stores refer to third-party retailers
who carry B&B products but do not operate specific B&B branded areas within their shops. The
wholesale distribution channels are tailored by geographic region, with each region served by
the combination of store types that B&B deems most appropriate for the local market. The table
below outlines the breakdown of each store type across the geographic regions in which B&B
operated as of December 31, 2020.

**Mono-Brand** **Multi-Brand**

B&B enters into standard contracts with its most important wholesalers governing, inter alia,
(i) the purchase process and the execution of the relevant orders, (ii) the terms of delivery of the
products and (iii) the procedure for claims by the wholesaler. Wholesalers generally reach out to
B&B to place product orders and may request certain products to be customized. Transportation
arrangements with respect to finished goods vary depending on various factors, including the
commercial practices of each market, the type of customer and the relevant contract, if
applicable. B&B provides wholesalers with a list of recommended retail prices for its products,
although wholesalers are not contractually bound to apply such prices.

The wholesale network is served directly from B&B’s headquarters. In Europe, including Italy, the
network is generally covered by sales agents, except for Greece and Turkey, which are served by
local distributors. America and the Far East are primarily covered by B&B’s internal salesforce,
other than Japan, which is served by a local distributor.

_Contract_

B&B’s contract projects are handled through their own distribution channel, either directly with
general contractors in the case of complete fit-outs or through architects and designers for FFEs.
Leads are normally pursued by B&B internal salesforce. In addition, some of the B&B directly
operated stores, such as the London store, have dedicated Contract teams.

**_Customers_**

B&B serves a range of customers, including design-conscious individuals, architects, interior
designers and other design professionals in the retail channel, high-end designer furnishings
stores in the wholesale channel, and businesses in the residential, hospitality, retail and office
sectors in the contract channel, such as hotel chains, and luxury/fashion brands. B&B’s customers
are highly diversified, with the top 20 customers for the year ended December 31, 2020
accounting for 24.2% of B&B’s revenue and no one customer accounting for more than 2.1% of
its revenue.

**_Intellectual Property_**

B&B primarily protects its intellectual property through the use of registered trademarks and
patents. B&B owns three trademark families, “B&B Italia”, “Maxalto” and “Arclinea”, in addition
to “Azucena” which B&B acquired in December 2017, generally on a worldwide basis and
covering, among other things, upholstered and wood furniture, lighting fixtures, accessories and

178


-----

textiles. In addition to registered trademarks, B&B owns several de facto trademarks covering the
names of its products and product lines. B&B has also registered certain of its product designs,
although the registration of designs is only undertaken on a case-by-case basis depending on the
importance of the product and its market positioning. B&B also owns a portfolio of 146 design
patents or design patent applications, primarily registered or under registration in Italy, EU, U.S.,
Australia and China, and three invention patents registered in Italy, in addition to two invention
patents registered by Arclinea. For information on risks related to intellectual property rights and
the efforts to protect them, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we are
_unable to protect our license and other intellectual property rights from others, or if_
_counterfeiting increases, our business may suffer, and we may incur significant additional costs”._

Outside of registered trademarks and patents, the majority of B&B’s intellectual property rights
are governed by license agreements with individual designers. See “—Agreements with
_Designers”._

**_Agreements with Designers_**
B&B’s relationships with designers are governed by license agreements. B&B is currently party to
39 license agreements with well-known designers. The license agreements grant the exclusive
ownership rights of the intellectual property associated with certain product shapes to the
designer, while granting B&B the right to commercially exploit the specified intellectual property
on an exclusive basis. The intellectual property that is the subject of the contract is typically
referred to in the form of a product list or pictures, rather than a list of registered or
unregistered intellectual property rights. As license agreements cover specifically enumerated
items of intellectual property, any new designs that are subsequently created for B&B are added
to the existing licence agreements. Designers remain free to contract with third parties regarding
those designs. The license agreements also normally include arbitration clauses in the case of
disputes. License agreements are typically open-ended in duration, with termination clauses in
favor of both B&B and the designers, although a few key licenses are subject to 20-year terms.
Following termination, the designer is entitled to request a transfer of the intellectual property
rights to another party, and designers who terminate their contracts are not limited by
non-compete clauses or product originality requirements. Pursuant to most of its license
agreements, B&B is required to pay royalties on a quarterly basis to the relevant designers in
amounts which are calculated on the basis of the reseller price list relevant for the Italian market.
However, for upholstered furniture designs, the net sales used as a basis for the calculation of
royalties do not normally include the value of covers and royalties are based off the reseller price
list relevant for the Italian market. the upholstery. For the year ended December 31, 2020, B&B
paid a total of €4.2 million in royalties to designers. In addition to these standard license
agreements, B&B has entered into a very small number of license agreements that provide the
relevant designers with additional rights, such as the right to receive upfront one-off payments
that are not linked to the relevant products’ sales performance or sponsorship fees related to
certain events or exhibitions, or our obligations to make investments in marketing activities in
connection with certain events, such as a particular anniversary of a product.

**_Information Technology_**
B&B has a centralized information technology infrastructure based in Italy for its global
operations, with the exception of Arclinea, which has its separate IT infrastructure. B&B’s
centralized infrastructure increases efficiency in the use of software and hardware, enhances
product support and cost control and, ultimately, leads to economies of scale. It also facilitates
the use of common processes and data structures throughout the business and ensures data
consistency and timely data availability for managing B&B’s business operations. B&B’s IT
department is composed of two functions: Hardware and Telco, which is responsible for network
administration and running the IT help desk, and SW and Application Management, which is
responsible for the company’s intranet, legacy systems, new application development and system
management. As of December 31, 2020, the IT department was made up of eight full time
employees, plus certain external consultant.

##### Common Factors Across Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen

**_Real Estate_**
We own certain real estate properties, including production premises and warehouses, and we
generally enter into lease agreements, including with respect to flagship stores. The term of lease
for our properties is between two and 24 years on average. For the year ended December 31,
2020, we paid a total of €13.7 million in rent and lease obligations.

_Flos_
Flos owns four material real estate properties: the company’s 17,529 square meters headquarters
in Bovezzo, assembly premises of 6,187 square meters in Collebeato, office space of 330 square
meters in Milan and a 82 square meters flagship store in Rome. The Ares subsidiary also owns
three production premises and warehouses in Bernareggio and a warehouse in Aicurzio. Outside
of these owned properties, Flos generally enters into commercial lease agreements covering its
flagship stores, corporate offices for its local subsidiaries and warehouses. In addition, Flos
operates the Antares’ headquarters in Valencia under a financial leasing contract. Given the
financial nature of the lease, Antares’ headquarters are recorded in Flos’ financial statements
under Property, plant and machinery.

_Louis Poulsen_
Louis Poulsen does not own any real estate and instead enters into commercial lease agreements
covering its head office, production facilities, warehouses and showrooms.

_B&B_
B&B owns two material properties, namely the headquarters in Novedrate and a manufacturing
facility in Misinto. In addition, B&B leases under commercial lease agreements the Arclinea
manufacturing facility in Caldogno (which includes the headquarters of the Arclinea business line
and a training center), the warehouses for the storage of raw materials, semi-finished products
and finished products in Carugo and Arosio and the directly operated retail stores.

B&B’s production operations are based in northern Italy, with three manufacturing facilities (the
Novedrate and Misinto facilities which are owned and the Caldogno facility which is leased), one
research and product development center (which is part of the Novedrate facility), three
warehouses for finished products (one rented and two managed by third parties) and one rented
warehouse for semi-finished products and outdoor assembly.

**_Employees_**
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,714 total employees, of which 10 employed by Design
Holding. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our future success depends on our ability to
_continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees. The loss of key personnel could have an_
_adverse effect on our operations”. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that 21% of our_
employees belonged to trade unions and we believe we have good relationships with both our
employees and their labor unions. We are party to collective bargaining agreements in Italy,
Denmark and the United States and we believe that the terms of these agreements are consistent
with industry practice.

**_Legal Disputes and Administrative Proceedings_**

From time to time, we are involved in administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings that arise
in the ordinary course of business and may also be subject to certain audits by tax or social
security authorities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Potential liabilities and
_costs from litigation and other proceedings could adversely affect our business”. Moreover, from_
time to time, former and present directors, officers, agents and employees may be involved in
civil and/or criminal proceedings. While in certain cases, there might substantial uncertainty
regarding the outcomes of the proceedings and the amount of any possible losses and we cannot
rule out that the claims or proceedings could result in rulings against us, we would defend, in
any claims or proceedings to the extent necessary and prudent.

Although the outcome of any of these legal disputes, administrative proceedings or audits
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any current
or potential matters of which we are currently aware will have a material adverse effect on our
financial conditions or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2020, we had set aside €2.9 million of provisions for risks and charges in
connection with legal proceedings.

**_Insurance_**

We maintain customary insurance coverage in our primary operating areas. We believe that we
have adequate insurance coverage against all material risks that are typically insured by similar
companies with comparable risk exposure. Insurance cover is regularly verified and adjusted
when necessary. However, we may incur losses that are not covered by existing policies or that
exceed the coverage level stipulated in our insurance policies. Furthermore, it is possible that we
may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at appropriate premiums in the
future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our insurance coverage could prove
_inadequate”._

**_Regulatory Environment_**

We believe that we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,
including those regarding the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our
employees, as well as the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing of furniture in the
various markets in which we operate, based upon existing facts presently known to us.
Compliance with local, national and international laws and regulations, including those relating
to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other
regulated activities has had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, but has to
date been accomplished without having a material adverse effect on our operations.

We have trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health and
safety requirements. Our goal is to reduce and, whenever possible eliminate the creation of
hazardous waste in our manufacturing processes. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and
ultimate costs to be incurred for the achievement of such goal due to uncertainties about the
status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to

181


-----

management, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations, competitive position or cash flows.
However, as the operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, we cannot be
certain that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely
affect its operations. See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _Our_ _Business—More_ _stringent_
_regulations, including in the area of consumer data privacy, could adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations”._

We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the production and sale of lighting devices
in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Specifically, when entering a new market or introducing
a new product to an existing market, the product shall comply with the requirements of the
applicable laws and regulations. Such requirements vary depending on the specific geographical
area and may include a manufacturer’s so called “Declaration of Conformity” (e.g. in the EU) or a
mandatory certification from the relevant authority (e.g. in China). Depending on the country of
operations, the process may take from two weeks to several months. As part of the approval
process, a change of the product to comply with the requirements could be necessary;
furthermore, the relevant authority might ask for certain minor changes to the specifications of
the product. Historically, however, we have not experienced any material issues or delays in
connection with obtaining regulatory approval for our products. In 2018, the U.S. introduced
certain bans on formaldehyde-releasing agents which are often found in, among other things,
resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products, glues, paints, coatings and lacquers.
As a result of these new rules, B&B adjusted its manufacturing processes to ensure that no such
agents were contained in its products, thus demonstrating its ability to promptly adapt its
manufacturing standards and processes to the highest industry standards required by the laws of
the countries in which it operates, as these may change from time to time. Although this change
did not result in any material cost increases, there can be no assurance that future changes in
environmental, product safety or other regulations would not result in material increases in raw
material costs or delays in production. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—More
_stringent regulations, including in the area of consumer data privacy, could adversely affect our_
_business, financial condition and results of operations”._

##### YDesign

Founded in 2001, YDesign specializes in the offering of modern and contemporary lighting, fans,
furniture and accessories to design-driven consumers and trade professionals.

YDesign originally focused on the sale of lighting products, as the group’s flagship brand
YLighting was launched in 2001. It subsequently created the YDesign brand in 2013 and
expanded its operations in Canada, further highlighting its ability to expand within different
markets and product categories. To this end, in 2016, YDesign acquired Lumens, a leading multichannel retail brand in lighting, modern furniture and furnishings, thereby further expanding
YDesign’s importance within the design lighting sector in the North American market. YDesign
generated net sales of USD163.2 million and USD148.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2020 and 2019, respectively, and adjusted EBITDA of USD13.3 million and USD12.0 million for the
same periods. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Information—The consolidated
_financial information of YDesign presented herein, including as part of our Pro Forma Synergized_
_EBITDA, was prepared on the basis of U.S. GAAP and is therefore not comparable with the_
_consolidated financial information of the Issuer, which was prepared on the basis of IFRS”._

**_Online Footprint_**

YDesign markets its offerings via two websites, YLighting and Lumens. Both websites offer a
comprehensive portfolio of brands, including products from some of our brands, as well as other
iconic brands such as Artemide, Foscarini, Kartell, Muuto, Nemo, Tom Dixon, which will provide
us with access to a sizeable customer base in the United States and Canada. YDesign offers a
complementary brand portfolio through YLighting and Lumens, with low customer overlap
between the two websites.

182


-----

_YLighting_
YLighting is a top-tier online shop focusing on lighting and furniture solutions and specializing in
high-end European designer brands. Products sold through this website include numerous iconic
pieces, including products from Flos and Louis Poulsen. Following the Acquisition, we expect to
begin distributing our B&B products through YLighting and expect this will generate positive
synergies. See “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial and
_Pro Forma Data”. For the year ended December 31, 2020, YLighting generated approximately_
36% of YDesign’s net sales.

_Lumens_
Lumens focuses on modern products at different price levels, thus targeting a wide range of
consumers. Lumens completes YDesign’s offering, as it focuses on a mid-tier market segment,
which demands quality products at a broader price range. For the year ended December 31, 2020,
Lumens generated approximately 64% of YDesign’s net sales.

**_Customers_**
YDesign has a large customer base of more than 250,000 active customers over the past 24
months, of whom approximately 100,000 represent repeat customers. YDesign divides its
customers in three categories: consumers, trade partners and contract customers.

_Consumer_
This customer category includes individual homeowners and tenants. Consumers generally order
through YDesign’s websites or, alternatively, through the sales team. Sales made through the
e-commerce platform have grown over time, as a result of, inter alia, a shift in consumer
purchasing preference to e-commerce, which was further reinforced by the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from customers in YDesign’s consumer division
accounted for approximately 63% of YDesign’s net sales.

_Trade partners_
Trade partners consist of, inter alios, interior designers, architects, contractors and business
owners. These customers liaise with YDesign to satisfy their and their clients’ needs for lighting
and furniture solutions. YDesign’s dedicated account managers support trade partners through
the entire ordering process and provide them with customized advice. Many trade partners rely
on YDesign services and products on a regular basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020,
revenues from YDesign’s trade partners accounted for approximately 27% of YDesign’s net sales.

_Contract Customers_
Contract sales consist of sales to electrical suppliers, purchasing agents and wholesale
distributors, purchasing products for commercial projects including hotels, restaurants, and office
spaces. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from customers in YDesign’s contract
division accounted for approximately 10% of YDesign’s net sales.

**_Business Model_**
_Sourcing_
YDesign does not manufacture any products. The merchandising team is responsible for
maintaining the accuracy of the assortment and identifying new products, which are primarily
sourced from European companies or brands in the United States. The merchandising team is also
responsible for vendors’ compliance with the operational guidelines that YDesign has established
to optimize the customer experience. Contracts with vendors usually regulate the main terms of
the relationship, including fees, rebates, rules on advertising and allocation of liability for
damaged or defective products.

_Ordering_
Customers can place orders either via YDesign’s branded websites or over the phone via
YDesign’s highly trained salesforce. While orders from consumers are usually made online, trade

183


-----

and contract customers typically prefer to order via YDesign’s sales teams, where they are paired
with a dedicated account manager.

_Delivering_
Once orders are received, depending on the availability of such products at YDesign Group’s
warehouse, the company either instructs the relevant vendor to drop ship products directly to the
customer or ships on-hand products directly. Shipping of in-stock products usually occurs within
two business days whereas shipping of made-to-order products such as select furniture or back
ordered products can take up to a few months.

Customers may return the purchased goods and receive a full refund on most items within 30
days of purchase, if the goods are returned in unused condition. Products that are returned
directly to YDesign can be sold as open box inventory, if in like-new conditions.

**_Marketing_**
YDesign operates as an online multi-brand seller across two websites and via sales teams, with no
showroom or physical footprint. Customers can locate products on the company’s websites by
either navigating or using the onsite search function. Products are organized by category and
brand, and products are also recommended in various locations, based on the customer’s search
and browse behavior. The website includes detailed descriptions of the main features of each
product and a comparison tool allows customers to compare different products. Customer
support is offered through dedicated, live customer service and self-service tools.

YDesign markets its products through digital channels including paid and natural (unpaid)
search, shopping, affiliate, retargeting, email, social and display advertising as well as direct mail
(catalogs), print advertising and public relation efforts. In addition, YDesign has a strong
presence on the main social networks, including Pinterest, Instagram and Facebook and is
increasing its presence on mobile, through developing a fully responsive site, where customers
can explore the catalogue of YDesign’s products seamlessly and make purchases.

**_Commercial Contracts_**
_Agreements with Customers_
YDesign does not typically enter into written agreements with consumers or trade partners. Sales
to contract customers are conducted on a purchase-order basis and no master or general
agreements are entered into in respect thereto.

_Agreements with Vendors_
YDesign generally uses form vendor contracts with its vendor brands. These contracts typically
provide, among others, (a) distribution terms (such as geographical scope), (b) pricing terms and
structure (including any discount policy), (c) rebates and terms of cooperative advertisement
programs (if any), which are generally calculated based on the company’s purchases from the
applicable vendor during the relevant period, and (d) YDesign operational terms to provide the
best customer experience. While contracts are usually for an indefinite term, they can be
terminated for convenience by either party upon prior written notice. YDesign is party to
exclusive distributor agreements with certain of its vendors, pursuant to which the company is
the exclusive e-commerce distributor of the products of the relevant vendor in the United States
and possibly in Canada.

**_Employees_**
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, YDesign has 187 total employees, 185 of whom are
full-time and all of whom are based in the United States. YDesign is not party to any collective
bargaining agreements and it estimates that none of its employees belong to a labor union.
YDesign believes it has good relationships with its employees. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Business—Potential liabilities and costs from litigation and other proceedings could adversely_
_affect our business” for information on a claim brought against YDesign by one of its former_
employees.

## PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, each of Carlyle and Investindustrial, in equal
percentages, have joint beneficial ownership, indirectly through intermediate holding
companies, of approximately 96% of the share capital of the Issuer. Certain affiliates participated
by the former management of the Group and a member of the Group management, indirectly
hold, via Design Holding (and their respective investment vehicles, if any), approximately 2% of
the share capital of the Issuer, and the Issuer indirectly owns, via Design Holding, the remaining
approximately 2% of its share capital.

##### Shareholders’ Agreement

Certain affiliates of Carlyle and Investindustrial have entered into a shareholders’ agreement (the
“Shareholders’ Agreement”). The Shareholders’ Agreement governs, among other things, the
relationship between Investindustrial and Carlyle with respect to their interests in the direct
parent of Design Holding, (International Design Holding S.à r.l.), Design Holding and its
subsidiaries, including the Group. The Shareholders’ Agreement provides for equal governance
rights, whereby each of Carlyle and Investindustrial has the right to appoint an equal number of
directors to each of the boards of International Design Holding S.à r.l. and Design Holding. The
Shareholders’ Agreement also sets forth a procedure for Carlyle and Investindustrial to follow in
connection with the joint appointment of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the
board of Design Holding. The board of Design Holding has discretion to manage and control the
business of the Group as it deems necessary or appropriate. All significant actions to be taken by
the Group require approval of the board of directors of Design Holding, which approval must
include the favorable vote of at least one director designated by Carlyle and one by
Investindustrial. If a matter is not approved by the board of directors due to a deadlock that is
not solved through the procedure set forth in the Shareholders’ Agreement, the relevant
resolution shall not be adopted. Similar procedures and provisions apply to the decisions of the
board of International Design Holding S.à r.l.

Subject to a minimum investment multiple being met and following a certain period of time, in
case of an unsolicited offer, either of Carlyle and Investindustrial will be entitled to sell and
require the other shareholders to sell all of the share capital of Design Holding or International
Design Holding S.à r.l.. Following a minimum lock-up period, either party will have the right to
sell the entire share capital of International Design Holding S.à r.l. or Design Holding through a
joint sale procedure set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement or an initial public offering and, if
such sale occurs before a certain period of time has expired, subject to a minimum investment
multiple being met. The agreement also provides for the right of each of Carlyle and
Investindustrial to cause an initial public offering of Design Holding after a certain period of time
has expired, with the other party being entitled to participate in such an initial public offering.
The Shareholders’ Agreement contains other customary provisions regarding confidentiality
information rights and cooperation. Management investing in equity interests of Design Holding
have entered into a separate investment agreement with Carlyle and Investindustrial setting
forth the terms and conditions of their relationship as shareholders of Design Holding and the
transfer regime of the shares held by them, as reflected in Design Holdings’ bylaws.

## CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in
the ordinary course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more
favorable to the related parties or our affiliates than they would expect to negotiate with
disinterested third parties.

##### Management Incentive Plan

Certain members of senior management and certain other employees in key departments of the
Group participate in a management incentive plan (the “Management Incentive Plan”), pursuant
to which International Design Holding S.à r.l., Design Holding and certain managers (the
“Co-Investors”) entered into call option agreements with such Co-Investors.

Pursuant to such call option agreements, each of the Co-Investors has been granted three classes
of options, each of which entitles the relevant Co-Investor to subscribe at a certain strike price
new shares issued by Design Holding upon occurrence of certain triggering events.

In addition, in connection with the Target Management Reinvestment, we expect to put in place
customary compensation schemes for the management of YDesign as of or immediately
following the Completion Date, which in the future may result in the issuance of further equity
interests of the relevant entity to YDesign management. See "Summary—The Transactions—The
Acquisition".

##### Indemnification Arrangements

To provide protection to individuals serving as our directors and executive officers, the current
articles of association provide each of our present and former officers with an indemnity against
loss or liability to the extent allowed by law. In addition, we maintain D&O insurance for the
entire Group.

##### Consulting Services

We have entered into a services agreement with our direct parent company, Design Holding, for
advisory and coordination activities provided by the group senior management at Design Holding
to the Group. For further information, see “Management—Group Senior Management”.

##### Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

**_Overview and structure_**

The Issuer as original borrower, and among others, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, UniCredit S.p.A.,
Goldman Sachs International, DNB Markets, a division of DNB Bank ASA, HSBC Bank plc and
Natixis S.A.—Milan Branch, as arrangers and bookrunners (together the “Arrangers”), and
UniCredit S.p.A., as Revolving Credit Facility Agent and Security Agent, entered into the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on November 9, 2018.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate principal
amount of €100 million on a committed basis. The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by
any current or future borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement in euros or certain other currencies by the drawing of cash advances or, subject to the
appointment of an Issuing Bank, the issue of letters of credit and/or bank guarantees and by way
of Ancillary Facilities (capitalized terms used in this sentence that are not otherwise defined in
this Offering Memorandum have the meaning ascribed to them in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at
any time. Borrowings are available to be used towards financing or refinancing the general
corporate and working capital purposes of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, including the
financing of acquisitions and other permitted investments and capital expenditure.

**_Additional facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contemplates the incurrence of additional uncommitted
revolving facilities in a maximum amount not to exceed (after taking account of the
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility) the amount able to be incurred under
paragraph (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, whether as a new facility or commitment, as an_
additional tranche of any existing facility or by increasing the commitments under an existing
facility in all respects. Such additional facilities shall be secured and shall rank pari passu with the
Revolving Credit Facility. The lenders of any such additional facilities, if not already lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, shall be required to accede to the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and shall have the benefit of the guarantees and Transaction Security (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). The availability, maturity, pricing and other
terms of any additional facility shall be those agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders
of that additional facility, provided that no additional facility may have a maturity date that is
earlier than the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility unless the maturity date of the
Revolving Credit Facility is amended to match that of the additional facility.

192


-----

##### Availability

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the
Termination Date (as defined below).

##### Maturity and repayment requirements

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on 15 May 2025 (the “Termination Date”). Each advance
shall be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a rollover
netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the Termination Date.

Amounts of outstanding loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility repaid by the borrowers
may be re-borrowed during the availability period for that facility, subject to certain conditions.

##### Interest rate and fees

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be the percentage
rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the applicable margin and applicable LIBOR, EURIBOR,
CIBOR, NIBOR or STIBOR (subject, in each case, to a zero floor). The interest rate is also subject to
the provisions of Italian law of 7 March 1996 No. 108 (Disposizioni in materia di usura), as
subsequently amended and supplemented, and any related implementing regulations, such that
if the interest (including default interest) payable by a borrower under the Revolving Credit
Facility along with any fee or cost or other payments due to the finance parties thereunder,
exceeds the maximum rate permitted by such law, the relevant interest rate or default rate shall
automatically reduce to the maximum rate permitted to be payable under such laws and related
implementing regulations. The initial margin under the Revolving Credit Facility of 3.25% per
annum is, subject to a margin ratchet pursuant to which the margin on the loans shall be reduced
if certain leverage ratio thresholds are met.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility to (and including) the last day of the availability period for the
Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the then applicable margin for the Revolving Credit
Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear during the availability period, on the
last day of the availability period and on the date on which a lender’s commitment under the
Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the Facility Agent and the Security
Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. Customary fees are also payable in respect
of any fronted letters of credit issued by an issuing bank.

##### Guarantees

The Issuer is an original guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Original
**Guarantor”). The Original Guarantor provides, subject to the agreed limitation language in the**
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to the Finance
Parties (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) by any of the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries which accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as an additional borrower
or an additional guarantor.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, B&B Italia S.p.A., Flos S.p.A., Louis Poulsen A/S and
Antares Iluminaciòn, S.A.U. have acceded to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as
additional guarantors.

the guarantors is equal to at least 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) of the Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”). The Issuer shall ensure that, if the Guarantor Coverage Test is
not satisfied on the date when the relevant Annual Financial Statements (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) are required to be delivered to the Facility Agent, within 90
days of such relevant test date, such other restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer (subject to the
Agreed Security Principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility) become guarantors until the
Guarantor Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been
guarantors for the purposes of the relevant test and provided that the Guarantor Coverage Test
is satisfied within such time period, no default or event of default under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement or other breach of the Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) shall arise in respect thereof).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires that (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility), on the date when each set of Annual Financial
Statements (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is required to be delivered to
the Facility Agent, any restricted subsidiary of the Issuer which is a Material Company (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, being a member of the Group which represents 5% or
more of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of the
Group (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) are required (subject to the
Agreed Security Principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to accede as a
guarantor by such time, provided that if such requirement has not been satisfied on any date
when the Annual Financial Statements (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) are
required to be delivered to the Facility Agent, within 90 days of such test date, each Material
Company (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall (subject to the Agreed
Security Principles set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) become guarantors and if
such requirements are satisfied within such time period, no default or event of default under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other breach of the Finance Documents (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall arise in respect thereof.

including: (i) status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with other obligations; (iv) power
and authority; (v) validity and admissibility in evidence; and (vi) governing law and enforcement.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the same incurrence covenants and

Credit Facility Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth
below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality,
actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Affirmative covenants_**

Current reporting covenants include, among others: (i) annual reports within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year of the Issuer; (ii) quarterly financial statements of the Issuer within 60 days
following the end of the Issuer’s first, second and third fiscal quarters of each fiscal year; and

(xiii) notification of default; and (xiv) compliance certificates.

195


-----

**_Negative covenants_**
The negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same as
the negative covenants in the Indenture.

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a Change of Control_**
The Issuer is required to notify the Facility Agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
of a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), following which
each lender under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entitled to require, by written
notice to the Issuer, repayment of all outstanding amounts owed to that lender and the
cancellation of that lender’s commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Ancillary Lender
or, as the case may be, Issuing Bank may, as between itself and the relevant member of the
Group, agree to continue to provide such Ancillary Facility or, as the case may be, Letter(s) of
Credit (with such arrangements continuing on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the
Finance Documents and the Transaction Security shall not, following release by the Security
Agent, secure any such Letter(s) of Credit or Ancillary Facility in respect of any claims that arise
after such cancellation). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph that are not otherwise defined
in this Offering Memorandum have the meaning ascribed to them in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

**_Financial covenants_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer to comply with a springing super
senior net leverage ratio covenant, being a ratio of Super Senior Indebtedness, net of cash and
cash equicalents of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, to Consolidated EBITDA of 2.50:1 (the
“Financial Covenant”). The Financial Covenant is only tested on the last date of each financial
quarter (each such date being a “Test Date”) and only if, on such date, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding
non-fungible additional commitments and utilizations in respect thereof, utilizations made on
the Issue Date and Ancillary Facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility, and utilizations by way
of letters of credit (or bank guarantees)), less the aggregate amount of all cash and cash
equivalents held by the Group, exceeds 40% of the total commitments of the Revolving Credit
Facility (excluding non-fungible additional commitments in respect thereof) as at such date (the
“Test Condition”). Capitalized terms used in this paragraph that are not otherwise defined in this
Offering Memorandum have the meaning ascribed to them in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

A failure to comply with the Financial Covenant when tested shall not (or be deemed to) directly
or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or
other term in the finance documents related to the Revolving Credit Facility or any default or
event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and shall be relevant solely for
the purposes of being a condition to the drawing of new utilisations under the Revolving Credit
Facility (and new utilisations for these purposes, do not include rollover utilisations).

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling, within the
20 business day period following the latest date on which each quarterly or annual financial
statements of the Group are required to be delivered to the Facility Agent, or at any time prior
to such date: (i) the borrowers of the Revolving Credit Facility to repay sufficient utilisations
thereunder such that the Test Condition is no longer met (and the Test Condition shall then be
deemed not to have been met on the applicable Test Date); or (ii) the net cash proceeds of New
Shareholder Injections received by the Issuer to be included in the calculation of Consolidated
EBITDA on such Test Date and the next three successive Test Dates solely for the purposes of
determining compliance with the Financial Covenant (an “EBITDA Cure”); provided that (x) there
shall be no more than two EBITDA Cures in any financial year; (y) there shall be no more than
five EBITDA Cures during the life of the Revolving Credit Facility; and (z) New Shareholder
Injections provided for EBITDA Cures shall otherwise be disregarded for purposes of determining
any financial ratio-based conditions, pricing or any baskets with respect to the covenants
contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

196


-----

**_Events of default_**
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for some of the same events of default, with
certain adjustments, as under the Notes. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
provides for certain customary events of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality
and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including:
(i) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when made or deemed
repeated subject to a 45 day grace period; (ii) unlawfulness and invalidity; (iii) failure to comply
in any material respect with the provisions of, or the material obligations under, the Intercreditor
Agreement subject to a 30 day grace period; (iv) repudiation and rescission subject to a 30 day
grace period; (v) cessation of business; and (vi) expropriation.

For the period from the date of completion of an Approved Acquisition (as such term is defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), until the date falling 120 days from such date of
completion (the “Clean-Up Period”) the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (an “Event of Default”) shall be deemed not to be a breach of
representation or warranty or a breach of covenant or an Event of Default (as the case may be) if
it would have been (but for this provision) a breach of representation or warranty or a breach of
covenant or an Event of Default provided that such breach or Event of Default: (i) is capable of
being remedied within the Clean-Up Period and the Issuer is taking appropriate steps to remedy
such breach or Event of Default; (ii) does not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and (iii) was not procured or approved by the Issuer. If the
relevant circumstances are continuing after the expiry of the Clean-Up Period, there shall be a
breach of representation or warranty, breach of covenant or Event of Default, as the case may be
(and without prejudice to any rights and remedies of the Finance Parties (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)).

##### Intercreditor Agreement

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**
To establish the relative rights of (i) the Super Senior Creditors (as defined below), the Senior
Secured Creditors (as defined below) and the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (as defined
below), (ii) the Issuer, the Guarantor, any future Guarantors in respect of the Notes and any
obligor in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility (as defined below),
Future Pari Passu Debt (as defined below) and Future Senior Subordinated Debt (as defined

By accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, that are contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement and which relate to the rights and obligations of the holders of the
Notes. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, the Intercreditor
Agreement should be read because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights
of the holders of the Notes. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in
the event of a conflict between the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement prevail.

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Overview_**
The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain debt of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including
the Company in respect of Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below), the Senior Secured Note

- provisions relating to the making of any acceleration or demand for payment in respect of the
Notes;

- the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness is subordinated upon the occurrence of
certain insolvency events;

- the requirement to turn over amounts received from enforcement of the Transaction Security;

- when the Transaction Security and any guarantee(s) issued by certain Debtors may be released
to permit an enforcement sale;

- the circumstances in which creditors’ claims (including noteholders’ claims against the Issuer)
might be required to be transferred to third parties or released to assist in enforcement; and

- the order for applying proceeds from the enforcement of the Transaction Security and other
amounts received by the Security Agent.

**_Parties_**
The super senior creditors (together the “Super Senior Creditors”) include, among others, the
agent under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “Senior Agent”), the Security Agent, the lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “RCF Lenders”) and issuing banks and ancillary lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility and the senior secured creditors (together the “Senior
**Secured Creditors”) include, among others, the Trustee for the holders of the Notes and the**
holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement also allows for accession by creditors of future
loan or bond indebtedness incurred by the Debtors (which is permitted by or not restricted under
the terms of the finance documents governing the Credit Facilities (as defined below), the Notes,
the Future Pari Passu Debt (as defined below) and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (as
defined below)), including any credit facility permitted to share in the Transaction Security and
rank senior to the Notes Liabilities and Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined below) with
respect to the proceeds of any enforcement of Transaction Security (such credit facilities together
with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), any senior secured notes issued
after the Issue Date pursuant to the Indenture (“Additional Notes”) or other indebtedness
permitted to be incurred on a pari passu basis to share in the relevant security shared by the
Notes Creditors (the “Future Pari Passu Debt”), hedge counterparties (the “Super Senior Hedge
**Counterparties”) party to interest rate or foreign exchange hedging agreements referred to**
below, which are secured on a super senior basis with respect to the proceeds of any
enforcement of Transaction Security (the “Super Senior Hedging Agreements”) and hedge
counterparties (the “Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties” and, together with the Super Senior
Hedge Counterparties the “Hedge Counterparties”) party to interest rate hedging agreements or
foreign exchange and certain other hedging agreements which are permitted to be secured on a
_pari passu basis (the “Pari Passu Hedging Agreements”, and together with the Super Senior_
Hedging Agreements, the “Hedging Agreements”). Finance parties under any Credit Facilities
(the “Credit Facility Creditors”) and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties are also Super Senior
Creditors (all Liabilities owing to such parties under the Credit Facilities and the Super Senior
Hedging Agreement, the “Super Senior Liabilities”). Holders of Future Pari Passu Debt and the

198


-----

Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties are also Senior Secured Creditors (and all Liabilities owing to
the Senior Secured Creditors in respect of the Notes, the Pari Passu Hedging Agreements, the
Future Pari Passu Debt, together with the Super Senior Liabilities, the “Senior Secured
**Liabilities”, and the Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors are together, the**
“Priority Secured Creditors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement also allows for accession by creditors of future indebtedness of
Design Holdings S.p.A. (“Holdco”) and/or the Debtors (which is permitted by the terms of the
finance documents relating to debt owing to the Super Senior Creditors (other than the Super
Senior Hedge Counterparties) and to the Senior Secured Creditors as senior secured creditors (the
“Senior Secured Debt”) and the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (as defined below)) and
provided that such future indebtedness complies with agreed parameters (if any) for the relevant
class of such future indebtedness. Any such future indebtedness that is subordinated to the
Senior Secured Debt and complies with agreed parameters (if any) for senior subordinated debt
shall be “Future Senior Subordinated Debt” for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Holders of Future Senior Subordinated Debt are “Future Senior Subordinated Creditors”. There is
a single Security Agent appointed to act on behalf of all Senior Secured Creditors and Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors at all times.

Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (each a member of the “Group”) nor
shareholder of a member of the Group which is not otherwise party to (1) a document creating
security in favour of the Credit Facility Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors or the Future
Senior Subordinated Creditors or (2) the debt documents thereby secured, shall be party to the
Intercreditor Agreement save for (i) any person that elects to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Shareholder Creditor (each a “Shareholder Subordinated Lender” and together
with Holdco, the “Shareholder **Creditors”)** (and the Intercreditor Agreement contains
subordination provisions and restrictions relating to the receivables owing from any member of
the Group to any Shareholder Creditor (the “Shareholder Debt Liabilities”)), (ii) Holdco in respect
of any existing or future proceeds loan made by Holdco to a member of the Group in respect of
the proceeds of any Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities of Holdco in its capacity as principal
debtor (“Shareholder (Proceeds Loan) Liability”), and (iii) subject to certain exceptions, certain
Debtors or other members of the Group that lend to a Debtor (each an “Intragroup Lender”)
that shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the loans or indebtedness owing
from such Debtor to such lending Debtor or other members of the Group in respect of intragroup loans (other than cash pooling arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of
business with any Debtor and loans of less than €25 million or loans outstanding in an aggregate
amount of €25 million or more but which are outstanding for less than 90 days) (the “Intra**Group Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to**
any Intra-Group Liabilities. However, Debtors are not prohibited from incurring, amending or
making payments in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities until an Acceleration Event under any
Secured Debt Document has occurred and is continuing.

##### Ranking and Priority

**_Priority of Indebtedness_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Liabilities, as the case may be, in respect of the
Credit Facilities (the “Credit Facility Liabilities”), the Notes (the “Notes Liabilities”), the Future
Pari Passu Debt (the “Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”), the amounts owing to the Super Senior
Hedge Counterparties under the Super Senior Hedging Agreements (the “Super Senior Hedging
**Liabilities”) and the amounts owing to the Non-Priority Hedge Counterparties under the Pari**
Passu Hedging Agreements (the “Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities”) and certain costs and expenses
of the Notes Trustee (the “Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities”) rank equally (without preference
among them) in right and priority of payment and in priority to the liabilities of Holdco and/or
the Debtors, as the case may be, in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (the “Future
**Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities”), Shareholder (Proceeds Loan) Liabilities, Intra-Group**
Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities (other than Shareholder (Proceeds Loan)
Liabilities).

199


-----

The Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities rank in priority to the Intra-Group Liabilities and
the Shareholder Debt Liabilities. The Shareholder (Proceeds Loan) Liabilities rank in priority to
the Intra-Group Liabilities and the Shareholder Debt Liabilities (other than Shareholder (Proceeds
Loan) Liabilities).

Other than as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement (including as specified above), the
Intercreditor Agreement does not rank any liabilities and/or obligations under the Debt
Documents owed by Holdco to any Creditor.

**_Priority of Security_**
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security (as defined below) shall rank
and secure the following Liabilities in the following order (and subject to the proceeds of such
security being distributed in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (as defined below)):

- first, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the
Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Senior Secured Trustee Liabilities and the Pari Passu
Hedging Liabilities, pari passu, and without preference between them (but only to the extent
the relevant Transaction Security is expressed to secure those Liabilities); and

- second, the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (but only to the extent the relevant
Transaction Security is expressed to secure those Liabilities).

If security is to be granted for a Credit Facility (other than the Revolving Credit Facility) then, to
the extent such Credit Facility cannot be secured on a pari passu basis with the Liabilities owing
by the Debtors to the finance parties under the Revolving Credit Facility (the “RCF Liabilities”)
without existing security first being released, the Parties agree that such Credit Facility will (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional
security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a second- or
lesser- ranking basis and such Credit Facility will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with the RCF
Liabilities which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any
amounts to be applied towards such Credit Facility shall be applied in the same manner and
order as the RCF Liabilities. In the event that it is not possible to permit the re-creation of
additional security documents as referred to above, no amendments or release of security under
the existing security documents shall be permitted unless permitted under the documents
thereby secured (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such security as
required by the relevant secured document), or if not so permitted under a specific document,
without the consent of the required creditors under that document.

If security is to be granted for Future Pari Passu Debt then, to the extent such Future Pari Passu
Debt cannot be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Debt without existing
security first being released, the Parties agree that such Future Pari Passu Debt will (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional security
documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a second- or lesserranking basis and such Future Pari Passu Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security pari passu with Senior
Secured Debt which would otherwise have the same ranking as contemplated above and any
amounts to be applied towards such Future Pari Passu Debt shall be applied accordingly. In the
event that it is not possible to permit the re-creation of additional security documents as referred
to above, no amendments or release of security under the existing security documents shall be
permitted unless permitted under the documents thereby secured (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by the relevant secured document), or if
not so permitted under a specific document, without the consent of the required creditors under
that document.

If security is to be granted for Future Senior Subordinated Debt then, to the extent such Future
Senior Subordinated Debt cannot be secured on a subordinated basis with the Senior Secured
Debt and/or on a pari passu basis with other Future Senior Subordinated Debt without existing

200


-----

security first being released, the Parties agree that such Future Senior Subordinated Debt will (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) be secured pursuant to the execution of additional
security documents securing the same assets subject to the relevant security on a lesser- ranking
basis and such Future Senior Subordinated Debt will nonetheless be deemed and treated for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by such security as contemplated above
and any amounts to be applied towards such Future Senior Subordinated Debt shall be applied
accordingly. In the event that it is not possible to permit the re-creation of additional security
documents as referred to above, no amendments or release of security under the existing security
documents shall be permitted unless permitted under the documents thereby secured (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the retaking of any such security as required by the relevant secured
document), or if not so permitted under a specific document, without the consent of the
required creditors under that document.

Any guarantees or security to be provided by (or over the shares or assets of) the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt shall be
given on a subordinated basis and shall not be given if such entity has not also given, or does not
also give, a corresponding guarantee or security in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities, and
shall only be given to the extent permitted or not prohibited by the finance documents
governing the Credit Facilities, the Notes and the Intercreditor Agreement.

##### Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt

The Debtors may make payments and prepayments in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities, the
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities and the
Future Pari Passu Debt Liabilities at any time in accordance with their terms until an Acceleration
Event has occurred.

Following the occurrence of an Acceleration Event or an Insolvency Event, no member of the
Group may make the payments described above except from the proceeds of any guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the Liabilities, the benefit of which
(however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, given to all the Priority Secured Parties in respect of their Liabilities (such guarantees,
indemnities or other assurances, being the “Shared Assurances”) or enforcement of security or
recoveries distributed in accordance with the section on Application of Proceeds/Waterfall below
or as otherwise agreed by the representatives for the Credit Facility Creditors (including the
Senior Agent, and each a “Credit Facility Agent”), the Notes Trustee and any relevant
representative of any Future Pari Passu Debt (each a “Future Pari Passu Debt Representative”)
subject to certain provisos (the “Payment Block”).

At any time following an Acceleration Event, if the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined
below) constitute the Instructing Group (as defined below), the Credit Facility Agent may deliver
a Payment Block Suspension Notice to the Security Agent which suspends the Payment Block.
Only one Payment Block Suspension Notice may be delivered during the life of any Credit Facility
in respect of the same event or set of circumstances.

Holdco may make payments and prepayments in respect of Future Senior Subordinated Creditors
in respect of any Future Senior Subordinated Holdco Liabilities at any time.

201


-----

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Debt Discharge
**Date”), neither the Issuer nor any member of the Group may make payments in respect of the**
Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities without the consent of (to the extent prohibited
under the relevant documents) the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and each Future Pari
Passu Debt Representative except for, among others, the following:

(1) if:

(a) the payment is of:

(i) any of the principal or interest (including capitalized interest) amount of the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities which is either (1) not prohibited from being
paid by the Credit Facility finance document, the Indenture or any Future Pari Passu
Debt finance document (or, to the extent prohibited, the required consent of the
relevant creditors under the relevant finance documents has been obtained for any
such payment) or (2) is paid on or after the final maturity of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities (provided that such maturity is not earlier than that
contained in the documents evidencing the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Liabilities as of the first date of incurrence of such Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Liabilities); or

(ii) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest and
default interest on the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities accrued due and
payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant debt documents for the
Future Senior Subordinated Debt, additional amounts payable as a result of the tax
gross up provisions relating to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities and
amount in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant debt documents for the
Future Senior Subordinated Debt,

or, in each case, a corresponding amount of Shareholder (Proceeds Loan) Liabilities;

(b) no notice delivered pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement blocking
payments in respect of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Liabilities (a “Payment
**Blockage Notice”) is outstanding; and**

(c) no payment default under the Revolving Credit Facility (or substantially equivalent
provision of any other Credit Facility) and no payment default of €500,000 (or its
equivalent in other currencies) or more in respect of the Notes Liabilities or Future Pari
Passu Debt Liabilities is continuing (a “Senior Payment Default”); or

(2) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined below) and the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined below) gives prior consent to that payment being made;

(3) properly incurred costs, commissions, taxes, consent fees and expenses incurred in respect of
(or reasonably incidental to) the Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance documents
(including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt finance documents);

(4) properly incurred costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect
of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt in
compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facility finance documents, the
Indenture and any Future Pari Passu Debt finance document;

(5) in respect of any Future Senior Subordinated Debt issued in the form of notes, certain costs
and expenses payable to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative;

(6) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with Future Senior Subordinated Debt;

(7) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with an amount which a member of the Group
is permitted by the terms of the Credit Facility finance documents, Indenture or any Future
Pari Passu Debt finance documents to pay to any person holding a direct or indirect interest
in the Company; or

202


-----

(8) if any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 (or its equivalent) in any financial year of the
Company.

Prior to the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, payments in respect of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Liabilities (other than those consented to by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors (as defined below) and Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below) and
certain specified exceptions) are suspended if:

(1) a Senior Payment Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(2) if an Event of Default under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Secured Debt (a
“Senior Default”) (other than a Senior Payment Default) has occurred and is continuing,
from the date on which the Credit Facility Agent, the Trustee or the Future Pari Passu Debt
Representative (as the case may be) (the “Relevant Representative”) delivers a Payment
Blockage Notice specifying the event or circumstances in relation to that Senior Default to
the Issuer, the Security Agent and the creditor representative of the Future Senior
Subordinated Creditors (the “Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative”) until the
earliest of:

(a) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for
failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt;

(b) the date falling 179 days after the receipt by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative of the Payment Blockage Notice;

(c) if a Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of a
Payment Blockage Notice, the date on which that Standstill Period expires;

(d) the date on which the relevant Senior Default is no longer continuing and if the Senior
Secured Liabilities have been accelerated such acceleration has been rescinded (and if
such acceleration consisted solely of declaring the relevant debt payable on demand
such rescission can be effected by the relevant majority creditors in respect of the
relevant debt);

(e) the date on which the Relevant Representative which issued the Payment Blockage
Notice (and, if at such time a Senior Default is continuing (other than in relation to the
Senior Secured Debt in respect of which the notice was given) the Relevant
Representative in respect of that other Senior Secured Debt) notifies the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative that the Payment Blockage Notice is cancelled;

(f) the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date; and

(g) the date on which the Security Agent or Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative takes any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group which it is
permitted to take in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

No Payment Blockage Notice may be served by a Relevant Representative unless 360 days have
elapsed since the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No Payment Blockage Notice may
be served in respect of a Senior Default more than 60 days after the date that the Relevant
Representative received notice of that Senior Default.

If a Payment Blockage Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Default or Senior
Payment Default has ceased to be continuing, the relevant debtor may then make those
payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt and if it does so promptly any Event of Default which may have occurred under the Future
Senior Subordinated Debt as a result of that suspension of payment shall be waived and any
Future Senior Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice (as defined below) which may have been
issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action
being required on the part of the Future Senior Subordinated Creditors. A Senior Payment
Default is remedied by the payment of all amounts then due.

##### Restrictions on Enforcement by the Future Senior Subordinated Debt; Standstill

Until the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, neither the Future Senior Subordinated Debt
Representative nor the holders of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt may take any
Enforcement Action with respect to the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (including any action
against the Company or the guarantors of the Future Senior Subordinated Debt (if any)) or direct
the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any relevant Transaction
Security Document without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as
defined below), except if (1) an Event of Default has occurred under the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt resulting from failure to pay principal at final maturity or (2):

(a) an Event of Default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance documents is
continuing;

(b) the Credit Facility Agent, the Trustee and the Future Pari Passu Debt Representative(s)
have received notice of the specified Event of Default from the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative;

(c) a Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(d) the relevant Event of Default is continuing at the end of the Standstill Period,

provided that no such action may be taken if the Security Agent is taking Enforcement Action or
acting in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group (or another party is taking
such action or instructions of the Security Agent under and pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement) to take steps for Enforcement and such action might reasonably likely adversely
affect such Enforcement.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an Event of Default under the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt finance documents (and prior to taking any Enforcement Action), the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative must by notice (a “Future Senior Subordinated Debt
**Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Credit Facility Agent, the Trustee and the Future Pari**
Passu Debt Representative(s) of the existence of such Future Senior Subordinated Debt Event of
Default.

A “Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt Representative serves a Future Senior Subordinated Debt Enforcement Notice
on the Credit Facility Agent, the Trustee and the Future Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) in
respect of the relevant Event of Default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt finance
documents until the earliest of:

(a) 179 days after such date;

(b) the date on which the Security Agent takes Enforcement Action (including the
enforcement of any Transaction Security permitted to be enforced under the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that if the Standstill Period ends pursuant to the
terms in this paragraph, the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Representative and
holders of Future Senior Subordinated Debt may only take the same Enforcement Action
(and only against the same entity) as is taken by the Security Agent and may not take
any other action against any other member of the Holdco Group. Enforcement Action
for the purposes of this limb shall not include action taken to preserve or protect
Security as opposed to realizing it;

(c) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of a particular Debtor owing any
Future Senior Subordinated Debt against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which a default under the Future Senior Subordinated Debt occurs for
failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the Future Senior
Subordinated Debt; and

204


-----

(e) the expiration of any other Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date that the
current Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure, waiver or
permitted remedy thereof).

If an Event of Default ceases to be continuing then (provided the relevant parties are made
aware of such fact) any relevant enforcement process (including any requirement of consultation
relating to enforcement) relying solely on that Event of Default shall cease to continue.

**_Enforcement by Holders of Secured Debt_**
Prior to the date upon which all Credit Facility Liabilities are fully discharged and paid in full and
the Credit Facilities Lenders are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation
to any of the Debtors under the Credit Facilities (the “Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date”), the
Security Agent shall act on the instructions of (i) the Credit Facility Lenders and the Super Senior
Hedge Counterparties whose super senior credit participations represent more than 50% of the
aggregate super senior credit participations of all Credit Facility Lenders and such Super Senior
Hedge Counterparties and their relevant representatives (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”)
and the holders of the Notes, the holders of Future Pari Passu Debt and the Non-Priority Hedge
Counterparties (collectively, the “Pari Passu Creditors”) whose aggregate senior secured credit
participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate senior secured credit participations of
all such creditors (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), in each case subject to the
Consultation Period referred to below and provided that such instructions are consistent with the
security enforcement principles set forth below or (ii) if prior to the Senior Secured Debt
Discharge Date, if both the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction
Security, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security (to the extent expressed to secure the Future Senior Subordinated Liabilities) which the
Future Senior Subordinated Creditors whose aggregate future senior subordinated credit
participations represent more than 50% of the aggregate future senior subordinated credit
participations of all Future Senior Subordinated Creditors (the “Majority **Future Senior**
**Subordinated Creditors”) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent.**

Following the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall act on the
instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

Following the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall act on the
instructions of the Majority Future Senior Subordinated Creditors.

**_Consultation_**
Prior to giving any instructions to the Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of
the Transaction Security and/or the requesting of a Distressed Disposal and/or the release or
disposal of claims or Transaction Security on a Distressed Disposal (“Enforcement”), the relevant
representatives of such Creditors shall notify the Security Agent and the other creditor
representatives for each of the Super Senior Creditors and each of the Senior Secured Creditors
that the applicable Transaction Security has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt of such a notice instructing the Security Agent to solicit instructions with
respect to (i) the enforcement of the Transaction Security or (ii) taking of any other Enforcement
Action by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the
Security Agent shall distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt,
following which, the Credit Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors), the Trustee and the Future Pari Passu Debt Representative shall consult in good faith
with each other and the Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is
received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) (the
“Consultation Period”), with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an instructing
group and agreeing an enforcement strategy.

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other

205


-----

Enforcement Action prior to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such
instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles set forth below (“Qualifying
**Instructions”)) where:**

(a) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency
event affecting a Debtor or Holdco; or

(b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (each
an “Instructing Group”, provided that (i) with respect to any Enforcement the Instructing
Group shall consist of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or (in certain circumstances and subject to certain requirements set out
in the Intercreditor Agreement) just the Majority Super Senior Creditors or just the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date the
Instructing Group shall be the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and (iii) after the Senior
Secured Debt Discharge Date the Instructing Group shall be the Majority Future Senior
Subordinated Creditors) determine in good faith (and notifies each other representative
of the other creditors party to the Intercreditor Agreement) that any delay caused by
such consultation could reasonably be expected to (x) reduce the amount likely to be
realized to a level such that (following application thereof in accordance with the
Payments Waterfall described below) the Super Senior Liabilities would not be
discharged in full or (y) have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect an
Enforcement or a Distressed Disposal and, in each case, any instructions shall be limited
to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior Secured Creditors or,
as the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant
Instructing Group is acting and the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the
instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Agent shall be
instructed to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting enforcement instructions (and for
these purposes failure to give instructions is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received
from either Instructing Group by the end of the Consultation Period (which have not been
resolved), the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from enforcing
the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with
the instructions provided by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in each case provided such
instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received from the
Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked.

If prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date:

(a) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the
end of the Consultation Period;

(b) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or
other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period; or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Debtor or Holdco and the Security
Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other
Enforcement Action at that time with respect to such Debtor or Holdco,

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by
the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions)
to the exclusion of those given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting
with any instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors).

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (acting
reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Security in a manner which is not

206


-----

consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, the creditor representatives for the relevant
Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Creditors shall give notice to the creditor
representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors and the Notes creditors and Future Pari Passu
Debt creditors (as appropriate) after which the creditor representatives for the other Super
Senior Creditors and the Notes creditors and the Future Pari Passu Debt creditors shall consult
with the Security Agent for a period of 10 days (or such lesser period as the relevant creditor
representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of Enforcement provided that
such creditor representative shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each
Enforcement Action.

The benefit of this section shall be for the Senior Secured Creditors and the Super Senior
Creditors only.

##### Security Enforcement Principles

Unless otherwise agreed between the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, enforcement of the Transaction Security must be conducted in accordance
with the “Security Enforcement Principles”, which are summarized as follows:

(a) It shall be the aim of any enforcement of the Transaction Security to maximize, so far as is
consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the
Transaction Security, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the
recovery by the Super Senior Creditors, the holders of the Notes, creditors of the Future Pari
Passu Debt, the Hedge Counterparties and the creditors of the Future Senior Subordinated
Debt (to the extent the Transaction Security is expressed to secure such debt) (in each case
without prejudice to the Payments Waterfall) (the “Security Enforcement Objective”) subject
to applicable law.

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior
written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, Notes Required Holders (as defined
below), the Future Pari Passu Debt Required Holders (as defined below) and, to the extent
secured by the Transaction Security, the Future Senior Subordinated Debt Required Holders
(as defined below).

(c) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective the Transaction Security will,
subject to applicable law, be enforced such that either (1) all proceeds of Enforcement are
received by the Security Agent in cash (or substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance
with the Payments Waterfall; or (2) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement will be received by
the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with
the Payments Waterfall, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless
the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(d) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that,
subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any requirements of
applicable law, the time frame for the realization of value from the Enforcement of the
Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant to Enforcement will
be determined by the Instructing Group (as defined below) provided that it is consistent with
the Security Enforcement Objective.

(e) On (i) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than
shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds
€5.0 million (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction
Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction
Security exists, the Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement or sale is made pursuant to
a public auction, a public offering or process supervised by a court of law which makes a
determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized
investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party
professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets

207


-----

similar or comparable to those charged under the Transaction Security to be enforced (a
“Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the
Transaction Security so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize
recovery, (B) that the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of
view after taking into account all relevant circumstances (provided that the provider of such
opinion may limit its liability in respect of such opinion to the amount of its fees in respect of
such engagement), and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Objective.

(f) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the
advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor
Agreement or any other provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.

(g) The opinion of the Financial Advisor (or an equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action is
fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances) will
be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

(h) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares
referred to in paragraph (d) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public
auction, any equity investors of the Group shall be entitled to participate in such auction.
Nothing in this principle shall require Enforcement of Transaction Security to take place by
way of public auction.

(i) In the absence of written notice from a Creditor or group of Creditors that are not part of
the relevant Instructing Group that such Creditor(s) object to any Enforcement of the
Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action does not aim to achieve
the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the Security Agent is entitled to
assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Objective.

(j) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the
Security Agent to rely on other advisers and/or exercise its own judgement in accordance
with this Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s Opinion to the effect that the particular action
could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be
conclusive evidence that the requirement of meeting the Security Enforcement objective has
been met.

##### Turnover

receives or recovers the proceeds of any Shared Assurances, any other guarantee, indemnity or
assurance, any enforcement of any Transaction Security other than in accordance with the

##### U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan

On or about the Completion Date, following the Escrow Release, the Issuer will make available
the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan to U.S. BidCo in an estimated principal amount of $72.2 million. The
proceeds of the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan will be used by U.S. BidCo, together with the proceeds
from an equity contribution by the Issuer, to complete the Acquisition and pay the associated
cost, fees and expenses. For further information, see “Summary—The Transactions—The
_Financing of the Acquisition” and “Use of Proceeds”._

Interest on the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan is expected to accrue at a rate that we anticipate will be
higher than the rate applicable to the Notes.

The U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan will be a senior obligation of U.S. BidCo. The U.S. BidCo Proceeds
Loan will not provide for any undertakings or representations by the parties. The Issuer’s interest
in the receivables under the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security on a
firstranking basis as part of the Collateral securing the Notes and the collateral securing the
Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain future hedging
obligations, if any, will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the security over the U.S. BidCo
Proceeds Loan in priority to the holders of the Notes.

The agreement regulating the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan will be governed by Italian law.

##### Existing Proceeds Loans

 I/C Loans
On November 22, 2018, in connection with the issuance of, and using a portion of the net
proceeds from, the Existing Notes, the Issuer, as lender, entered into the Flos I/C Loan
Agreement, the B&B I/C Loan Agreement and the Danish HoldCo I/C Loan Agreement (the
proceeds of which were used by Danish HoldCo to make available to Luminous Designs Denmark
ApS a subsequent proceeds loan), with respectively Flos, B&B and Danish HoldCo.

Each of the Flos I/C Loan Agreement, the B&B I/C Loan Agreement and the Danish HoldCo I/C
Loan Agreement, each as amended and restated on or about the Issue Date, is expected to
remain outstanding following completion of the Transactions. As of December 31, 2020, an
aggregate principal amount equal to €308,150,240.3 was outstanding under the I/C Loans.

The final maturity date of the I/C Loans will be on or about the maturity date of the Notes and
the agreements governing the I/C Loans will provide that the relevant borrower shall or may

215


-----

determine to repay any of the I/C Loans (i) on the relevant maturity date; (ii) in such amounts and
on such dates (but only to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) so as to ensure
that the Issuer can make a payment when due (whether upon acceleration or otherwise) in
respect of any amount the Issuer shall from time to time pay under the Existing Indenture, any
Existing Notes, the Indenture and/or any Note in connection with any repayment, redemption or
repurchase of outstanding Existing Notes and/or Notes (whether upon acceleration or otherwise),
prior to the final maturity date of the Existing Notes under the Existing Indenture and/or the
Notes under the Indenture; (iii) any payment of interest and/or Additional Amount (as defined in
the Existing Indenture and/or the New Indenture), due under the Existing Notes and/or the Notes
(becoming due and payable for any reason) from time to time, to the extent the relevant
borrower is unable to make a dividend or distribution to the lender for such purposes, due to
insufficient distributable reserves or due to other restrictions under applicable Italian corporate
law up to an overall aggregate amount equal to 20% of the Total Commitment (as defined
under the relevant agreements regulating the I/C Loans) as of the signing date of the I/C Loans
agreements; and/or (iv) in such amounts and on such dates as may be necessary to avoid any
breach of any applicable law or regulation and/or illegality. Other than in the cases described
above, the relevant borrower under the I/C Loans may not prepay, in whole or in part, the
amounts outstanding under the relevant I/C Loans and no repayment, reduction, extinguishment
or equitization of the receivables arising under the relevant I/C Loan agreement may occur.

The I/C Loans do not provide for any undertakings or representations by the parties. The Issuer’s
interest in the receivables under each of the I/C Loans will be assigned by way of security on a
first-ranking basis as part of the Collateral securing the Existing Notes, the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility and counterparties to certain future hedging obligations, if any, will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the security over the I/C Loans in priority to the holders of the
Existing Notes and/or the Notes.

The agreements regulating each of the I/C Loans are governed by Italian law.

See also “Risk factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Our
_right to receive payments under the I/C Loans may be subordinated by law to the obligations of_
_other creditors”._

agreements with local banks pursuant to which certain short term working capital, export
finance and general corporate purposes facilities have been obtained to finance their operations
and liquidity needs (the “Short Term Bilateral Facilities”). The Short Term Bilateral Facilities are
unguaranteed obligations of each of Flos and B&B. These unsecured and uncommitted credit
facilities generally relate to overdraft protection and trade credit facilities, and are utilized from
time to time as part of the cash management. Some of these credit facilities also provide for the
ability of the relevant company to request the issuance of letters of credit (linee di firma) by the
relevant financial institution in connection with the day-to-day operations. As of December 31,
2020, €39,896,226 was outstanding under the Short Term Bilateral Facilities. See
“Capitalization”.

LP is party to an uncommitted bilateral DKK 70 million (ca. €9.4 million) overdraft line
agreement with a local bank pursuant to which certain short term working capital and general
corporate purposes facilities have been obtained to finance its operations and liquidity needs
(the “LP Bilateral Facilities”). The LP Bilateral Facilities are unguaranteed obligations of LP. The
unsecured and uncommitted credit facilities generally relate to overdraft protection. The LP
Bilateral Facilities is subject to renegotiation once a year, the next time being on or before
September 30, 2021.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Bank Guarantees (fideiussioni bancarie)_**
In the ordinary course of business, Flos and B&B are required to provide certain bank guarantees
(fideiussioni _bancarie)_ for the purpose of guaranteeing their obligations under certain
commercial agreements. Such guarantees are generally issued by commercial banks. As of
December 31, 2020, Flos and B&B had obtained bank guarantees in an aggregate outstanding
amount of approximately €378,976 and €8,465,949.33, respectively.

**_Intercompany Loans_**
B&B, as lender, has granted, in the ordinary course of business and/or in order to optimize the
cash flow management of the B&B Group, various unsecured and interest bearing intercompany
loans to certain of its subsidiaries in order to support their financial requirements. We expect
that these intercompany loans will remain outstanding following the Transactions.

**_Cash Pooling Arrangements_**
The Issuer, Flos and B&B have in place a cash pooling system to manage their cash shortfalls and
surpluses, backed up by bank account and overdraft facility agreements entered into by and
between the Issuer and the relevant subsidiaries, as participating companies, and UniCredit
S.p.A., as contracting bank.

##### Existing Fixed Rate Notes

On November 16, 2018, the Issuer issued €400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its
6.5% Senior Secured Rate Notes due 2025, under the Existing Indenture. The Existing Fixed Rate
Notes will mature on November 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased and cancelled
in accordance with the Existing Indenture.

The terms of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes are substantially similar to the terms of the Notes
offered hereby. See “Summary—The Offering” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants”.
The Issuer is required to pay interest on the Existing Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on
each May 15 and November 15, in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the terms
and conditions of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes. The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and on the Vienna Stock Exchange and admitted
to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the Third market (MTF) operated by the Vienna Stock
Exchange, in accordance with the rules and regulations of such exchanges.

The Notes will trade separately under different ISIN/Common Code numbers than the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes and will not be fungible with them. The Existing Fixed Rate Notes sold under
Regulation S have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream under common code and ISIN code 190824896 and XS1908248963, respectively. The
Existing Fixed Rate Notes sold under Rule 144A have been accepted for clearance through the
facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream under common code and ISIN code 190825787 and
XS1908257873, respectively.

## DESCRIPTION OF NOTES

##### General

In this description, (1) the terms “we”, “us” and “our” each refer to International Design Group
S.p.A., a joint stock company (società per azioni) incorporated under the laws of Italy (the
“Issuer”), and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including, following completion of the Acquisition,
YDesign Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Target” or “YDesign”) and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (together with the Target, the “Target Group”) and (2) the term
“Issuer” in this “Description of Notes” refers only to International Design Group S.p.A. and not to
any of its Subsidiaries. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of Notes” section and not
otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions”.

For purposes of this description, the €470.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2026 are collectively referred to as the “Notes”. The Notes are
to be issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the
Issuer and The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”),
legal representative of the holders of the Notes (mandatario con rappresentanza) under the
Indenture and common representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes
pursuant to articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, and UniCredit S.p.A., as security
agent (the “Security Agent”) and as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to and for the
purposes set forth under article 2414-bis, 3rd para. of the Italian Civil Code (in such capacity, the
“Representative”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Indenture will not be qualified under or
subject to, and will not incorporate (by reference or otherwise), any of the provisions of the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Prior to
the Completion Date, the Issuer will not control the Target Group, and the Target Group will not
be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of Notes”. As such, the Issuer cannot
assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that
would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to
such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer,
together with certain available cash at the Issuer, to (i) satisfy and discharge and ultimately
redeem the Existing Floating Rate Notes at a price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and
additional amounts, if any, (ii) fund the purchase price for the Acquisition and (iii) pay costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as further described in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds”. Pending consummation of the Acquisition
and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Initial Purchasers will,
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit €150.0 million of gross
proceeds from the offering of the Notes available under Tranche A (as defined under “Use of
_Proceeds”) under the Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant_
to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated on or prior to the Issue Date
among the Issuer, the Trustee and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Notes escrow agent (the
“Escrow Agent”). The Escrow Account will be in the name of the Issuer, controlled by the Escrow
Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes. The release of
the escrowed proceeds from the Escrow Account (the “Release”) will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the expected completion of the Acquisition pursuant
to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement within 2 Business Days following the Release. If the
conditions to the Release have not been satisfied on or prior to November 20, 2021 (the “Escrow
**Longstop Date”), the Issuer will be required to redeem Notes with an aggregate issue price equal**
to €150.0 million at a redemption price equal to the issue price of such Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest from the Issue Date to but excluding such special mandatory redemption date

218


-----

and additional amounts, if any. The redeemed Notes shall be selected pro rata for redemption
from all of the Notes. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”.

The Issuer will issue Notes with an initial aggregate principal amount of €470.0 million. The
Issuer may from time to time after this offering issue additional Notes under the Indenture
(“Additional Notes”) without notice to or the consent of holders of Notes. Any offering of
Additional Notes would be subject to the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and_
_Preferred Stock”. Except with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and as_
otherwise provided for in the Indenture (including as described under “—Meetings of Holders of
_Notes” below), the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes subsequently issued_
under the Indenture will vote as a single class (except as otherwise described under
“—Amendments and Waivers”). Any Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to
the Notes issued on the Issue Date except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining
such interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which
such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to
whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of
Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the
terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in
part;

(7) if other than denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;
and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.

Any Additional Notes that differ with respect to maturity date, interest rate or optional
redemption provisions from the Notes issued on the Issue Date will constitute a different series of
notes from the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Additional Notes that have the same maturity
date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the Notes issued on the Issue Date will
be treated as the same series as the Notes issued on the Issue Date unless otherwise designated
by the Issuer. The Issuer similarly will be entitled to vary the application of certain other
provisions to any series of Additional Notes; provided that, if any series of Additional Notes are
not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax and Italian tax purposes in the reasonable
judgment of the Issuer, the Additional Notes will be issued with a separate CUSIP, ISIN or
Common Code, as applicable, from the previously issued and outstanding Notes. Unless the
context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes”,
references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include the Notes issued on the Issue Date as well as
any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture and the Guarantees thereunder will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness

219


-----

and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations,
release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the
Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”
for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered holders will have rights under the Indenture. The Notes will be issued only in fully
registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral
multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer has made an application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”) on the Issue Date. However, there can be
no guarantee that such application will be accepted or approved as of the Issue Date or at any
time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. See also
“—Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes” and “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the
_Notes”._

The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Collateral” define the terms of
the security that will secure the Notes. The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes
(as defined below) are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Intercreditor
_Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements”._

The Indenture will provide that any reference to a merger, transfer, consolidation,
amalgamation, distribution, assignment, sale, disposition or transfer, or similar term, shall be
deemed to apply to a division of or by a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust, or
an allocation of assets to a series of a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust (or
the unwinding of such a division or allocation), as if it were a merger, transfer, consolidation,
amalgamation, distribution, assignment, sale or transfer, or similar term, as applicable, to, of or
with a separate Person. Any division of a limited liability company, limited partnership or trust
shall constitute a separate Person hereunder (and each division of any limited liability company,
limited partnership or trust that is a Subsidiary, Restricted Subsidiary, Unrestricted Subsidiary,
joint venture or any other like term shall also constitute such a Person or entity).

This “Description of Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes,
the Guarantees, the Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of
the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes Documents for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available from us
upon request.

##### Ranking

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be joint and several, senior secured obligations of the Issuer and
will:

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including Indebtedness under the
Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement);

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or which secures
such other Indebtedness on a super senior basis, to the extent of the value of the property and
assets securing such Indebtedness;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of all
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries;

- rank contractually senior in right of payment to future Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuer, if any; and

220


-----

- within the time periods specified herein, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by the relevant Guarantors (as defined herein),
subject to the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject_
_to certain limitation on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations”._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral only after certain obligations entitled to receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes have been repaid in full, including
(i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (ii) other Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to receive proceeds of an enforcement of
the Collateral in priority to the Notes and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations.

As of December 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would
have had total indebtedness of €921.6 million, of which €470.0 million is represented by the
Notes, €400.0 million is represented by the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, and €51.6 million is
represented by certain other financial liabilities, none of which was secured and €46.9 million of
which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16. See “Capitalization”.

The Issuer is a holding company with limited direct operations. Substantially all of the operations
of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer is and is expected to
continue to be dependent upon dividends and other payments from its Subsidiaries to generate
the funds necessary to meet our outstanding indebtedness service and other obligations and such
dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our
indebtedness, including any financing agreements of our Subsidiaries. Our Subsidiaries may not
generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on
our indebtedness, including the Notes. Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of
such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the Notes. The Notes,
therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will
contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
may Incur, and Preferred Stock that Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may issue, such limitations are
subject to a number of significant exceptions.

##### Guarantees

On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed. Within 20 Business Days following the Issue
Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by
Flos S.p.A., B&B Italia S.p.A., Louis Poulsen A/S and Antares Iluminación S.A.U. (collectively, the
“Initial Guarantors”). Within 90 days following the Completion Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Notes will also be guaranteed on a senior basis by U.S. BidCo and YDesign
(collectively, the “U.S. Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors and any subsidiary
of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture after the
Issue Date, the “Guarantors”, and the guarantees of the Notes provided by the Guarantors, the
“Guarantees”; provided that upon the release or discharge of any such Person from its
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, such Person automatically ceases to be a
Guarantor).

Each Guarantee will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations, as described
under “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be_

221


-----

_subject to certain limitation on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to_
_certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”. The Guarantors are expected to_
guarantee on a senior basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at
Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
and the Notes (including interest that, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect
to the Issuer, would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or not a claim is allowed against
the Issuer for such interest in the related bankruptcy proceeding) to the holders and the Trustee,
whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein
called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Guarantors also guarantee or will guarantee, as
applicable, on a senior basis the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor upon issuance will be a general, senior obligation of such
Guarantor and will:

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor
that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee (including its guarantee of
Indebtedness under the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement);

- rank contractually senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, if any;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee, or which secures such other
Indebtedness on a super senior basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of any
of such Guarantor’s Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable
jurisdiction and defenses generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those
relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, “thin capitalization” rules and similar
laws, regulations and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law. In particular, Guarantees granted by any Spanish Guarantor will not
guarantee those obligations or liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of
Spanish financial assistance provisions in accordance with Article 143.2 (if a Spanish Guarantor is
a limited liability company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada)) and Article 150 (if a Spanish
Guarantor is a public company (sociedad anónima)) of the Spanish Capital Companies Act. In
addition, the Guarantees will be further limited as required by the Agreed Security Principles as
described below. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Consolidations”. This includes limiting Guarantees_
to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable
Guarantor without rendering the Indenture or the Guarantees, as it relates to such Guarantor,
voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. However, such limitations may not be effective
under local law. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_
_will be subject to certain limitation on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”._

Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph,
shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

222


-----

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors,
transferees and assigns.

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(1) upon the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger,
consolidation or dissolution) of (x) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, if after such
transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) all or substantially all
the assets of such Guarantor if such sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including
through merger, consolidation or dissolution) is made in compliance with the Indenture so
long as such Guarantor is also released from its guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and Certain Capital Markets Debt (if applicable);

(2) upon the Issuer designating such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the provisions set forth under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Restricted_
_Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary;”_

(3) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) as a result of a transaction that would not be prohibited under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”;_

(6) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the
Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors”,
(i) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or (ii) the repayment of the Indebtedness
that resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes (and the release, discharge or
repayment of any other Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock that would require such
Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors”), except if a release, discharge or repayment is by
or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other
guarantee of Indebtedness;

(7) upon the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Defeasance”, or if the Indenture is discharged (including through
redemption or repurchase of all the Notes as a result of satisfaction and discharge or
otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

A Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be a
Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof.

Upon the request and at the expense of the Issuer, the Security Agent and, to the extent
reasonably requested, the Trustee, shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject
to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Trustee without the consent of the holders or any other action or consent on the
part of the Trustee.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and the Issuer will not have any
obligation to cause any of its Subsidiaries to guarantee the Notes in the future, except as
described in the first paragraph of this section “—Guarantees” above and as required under the
circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors”. See
“Summary—Corporate Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements”.

##### Terms of the Notes

The Issuer will issue €470.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on, 2026 and will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly,
equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be
deemed to be zero) plus (ii) %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation
**Agent”), who shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. Interest on the**
Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

- be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and,
commencing on, 2021;

- be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the,, and
immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

If a payment date is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that
is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Interest Calculation Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of
interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest
Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the
actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365. All percentages resulting
from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded
upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In
no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for
verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Notes.

“Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest
rate payable on the Notes in respect of each interest period, which shall initially be The Bank of
New York Mellon, London Branch.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date that appears on Reuters page EURIBOR01 as
of 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Calculation Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR
shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on an Interest Calculation Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of
each of four major banks in the euro zone inter-bank market to provide such bank’s offered
quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time)
on such Interest Calculation Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for deposits
in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two
TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two such offered
quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such

224


-----

quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of
three major banks in London to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum),
as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Interest Calculation Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two
such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest
Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no
longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of
interest in respect of euro-denominated securities hereunder, the alternative basis for
determining the rate of interest on the Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the
euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of eurodenominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that
there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, the Issuer shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the
rate of interest on the Notes; provided further that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant
to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. Following the adoption of an
alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall
be deemed to refer to such alternative basis.

“euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that at such
time use the euro as their official currency.

“Interest Calculation Date” means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the
first day of such Interest Period (as defined below) in respect of the relevant Interest Period.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment
date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue
Date.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page
as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF”
or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be
nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in
euro.

The rights of holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid,
the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a
result of any such delay.

##### Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at
the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined below); provided that all
such payments with respect to the Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in
the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream or, in the
case of DTC, registered in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC, and held with a

225


-----

custodian for DTC, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account specified by the holder or holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered
Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for
the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”.

##### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes (each, a “Paying Agent”). The
initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer will also
maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin
Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers
of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or
Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice to the holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

For so long as Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may
also be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg or by other
methods considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

##### Transfer and Exchange

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more
fully under the section “Transfer Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum. In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream
will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to
the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

226


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests
will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold
interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons
shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes
is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under the section Transfer Restrictions in the Offering Memorandum and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns
the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under the section “Transfer
_Restrictions” in the Offering Memorandum._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging
Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of
any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

227


-----

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled
to treat the holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

##### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes
of the Indenture and, upon the Acquisition, the Target and its subsidiaries will be “Restricted
Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below
under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate
certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

##### Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption

If the offering of the Notes closes prior to the Completion Date, concurrently with, or prior to,
the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow
Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Initial Purchasers will
deposit with the Escrow Agent €150.0 million of gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes
into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of
the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to an escrow charge dated the
Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited
in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other
property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property”.

The Escrow Agent shall promptly effectuate the Release, subject only to receipt by the Escrow
Agent of an Officer’s Certificate delivered by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent with a copy to the
Trustee, on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, to the effect that:

- the Acquisition will be consummated within two Business Days following the Release, on
substantially the same terms as described in the Offering Memorandum under the section
“Summary—The Transactions”, except for any waivers, changes or other modifications that will
not, individually or when taken as whole, have a materially adverse effect on the holders of
the Notes or to which the holders have consented; and

- as of the date of delivery of the Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default
under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled Events of Default below with
respect to the Issuer.

Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall
be paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above does not take place on or
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, in the
good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date, (d) the Initial Investors cease to beneficially own or control a majority of
the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) a Default or Event of Default arises
under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled Events of Default on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date with respect to the Issuer (the date of any such event being the
“Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem Notes with an aggregate issue price equal to
€150.0 million (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory
**Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of such Notes, plus accrued but**
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). The
redeemed Notes shall be selected pro rata for redemption from all of the Notes.

228


-----

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Escrow Agent, and will provide that the Notes to be redeemed shall be redeemed on a date that
is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to
each holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such holder’s Notes and, concurrently
with the payment to such holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

In the event that the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special
Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required
to contribute to the Escrow Account an amount equal to the amount by which the applicable
Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds
the amount of the Escrowed Property. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—If
_certain conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer will be_
_required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on_
_the Notes”._

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the
Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes a security interest in the Escrow Account.
Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special
Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the
Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any
relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

Amounts may be released from the Escrow Account prior to the Completion Date to pay negative
interest charged on the Escrow Account and to pay interest on the Notes on any interest
payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Release.

##### Security

**_General_**

On the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-ranking
security interest in the Escrow Account. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”._

Within five Business Days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by first-ranking
security interests in:

1) 100% of the share capital of the Issuer;

2) certain material bank accounts of the Issuer; and

3) the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the B&B I/C Loan, the Flos I/C Loan and the Danish
HoldCo I/C Loan (collectively, the “Initial Collateral”).

Within 20 Business Days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by first-ranking
security interests in 100% of the share capital of each of Flos S.p.A., Antares Iluminación S.A.U.,
B&B Italia S.p.A., Danish HoldCo and Louis Poulsen A/S (collectively, the “Post Issue Date
**Collateral”).**

Within 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured by first-ranking
security interests in:

1) the equity interests of YDesign held by U.S. BidCo and the equity interests of U.S. Bidco held
by the Issuer; and

229


-----

2) the Issuer’s receivables in respect of the U.S. BidCo Proceeds Loan (collectively, the “Post
**Completion Date Collateral” and, together with the Initial Collateral and the Post Issue Date**
Collateral and any other collateral securing the Notes from time to time pursuant to the
Indenture, the “Collateral”).

The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain
defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability and may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral”._

The Collateral also secures or will secure, as applicable, on a first-ranking basis the Existing Notes
and the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (if any). Subject to certain
conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens”, the Issuer and its Restricted_
Subsidiaries are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes issued by the Issuer as permitted under
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value_
_of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the other secured indebtedness may be_
_secured by assets that do not secure the Notes”. Any other security interests that may in the_
future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantee and the Indenture
would also constitute Collateral. All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under
“—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees”, certain property, rights and assets (other than the
Collateral described in the first and second paragraphs of this section) may not be pledged, and
any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a
guarantee or security may not be given, or may be limited. The following is a summary of certain
terms of the Agreed Security Principles:

- general legal and statutory limitations, financial assistance (including under Article 2358 and/or
2374 of the Italian Civil Code, under the Danish Companies Act and Articles 143.2 and 150 of
the Spanish Capital Companies Act), corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, transfer pricing, thin capitalization, earnings stripping, controlled foreign
corporation and other tax restrictions, exchange control restrictions, capital maintenance rules,
liquidity impairment rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security (as applicable) or
may require that the guarantee or security be limited in amount or otherwise. In particular,
Guarantees granted by any Spanish Guarantor will not guarantee those obligations or
liabilities which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance
provisions in accordance with, when applicable, Article 143.2 (if the Spanish Guarantor is a
limited liability company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada)) and Article 150 (if the Spanish
Guarantor is a public company (sociedad anónima)) of the Spanish Capital Companies Act.

- the time and cost (including material adverse tax consequences or adverse effects on interest
deductibility and stamp duty, registration taxes, notarisation and registration fees) of
providing a guarantee or security (and the terms or perfection of such security) must not be
disproportionate to the benefit;

- in certain jurisdictions it may be impossible, impractical or disproportionately costly or would
unduly disrupt the business of the Group to grant a guarantee or create security over certain
assets, and a guarantee will not be granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets;

- any assets subject to legal requirements, contracts, leases, licenses or any other third party
arrangements (including, without limitation, any trade receivables) which may prevent those

230


-----

assets from being charged will be (subject to considerations) excluded from any relevant
security; provided that, if the relevant asset is material, if requested by the Security Agent prior
to the entry into the relevant transaction security and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor
determines (acting in good faith) that such endeavours will not jeopardise commercial
relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the Group will use commercially
reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent or waiver;

- no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any indebtedness
permitted to be incurred and/or to the extent constituting a permitted lien unless specifically
required by the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other finance
documents to the contrary;

- certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or another external
body’s consent may be required to enable the provision of a guarantee or security;

- other than in respect of the security and guarantees expressly referred to in (i) the third
paragraph under this “—Security—General” and (ii) the first paragraph under “—Guarantees”,
no member of the Group will be required to grant security or guarantees if they are not (other
than the Issuer) wholly-owned by another member of the Group or to the extent that to do so
is not within their legal capacity or where to do so would conflict with the fiduciary duties of
directors or contravene any legal prohibition, contractual restriction or regulatory condition or
would result in (or in a risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or
officer, provided that the relevant entity shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to
overcome any such obstacle;

- the Group will not be liable for any fees, costs, taxes, expenses or other amounts payable in
connection with any re-taking, re-registration, re-notarization or other requirement for
perfection, presentation, novation or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or
assignments by the holders of the Notes or lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement;

- access to assets of a security provider and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be
restricted or limited to minimise fees and duties where the benefit of increasing the guarantee
or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees and duties;

- any transaction security document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified
if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in
evidence or for the document to bear a certified date as a matter of Italian law and where
possible, the transaction security documents governed by Italian law will be executed by way
of exchange of correspondence (scambio di corrispondenza commerciale), or outside Italy, in
order to minimise any documentary tax cost connected with their execution;

- other than in respect of the security and guarantees expressly referred to in (i) the third
paragraph under this “—Security—General” and (ii) the first paragraph under “—Guarantees”,
no guarantees or security will be required in jurisdictions other than Italy, Denmark, Spain and
any jurisdiction in which any borrower of any credit facilities or any member of the Group
which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization representing 5% or
more of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (a “Material Company”) is incorporated;

- security shall be limited to security over the shares of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor or
Material Company, as applicable, security over material long term structural intercompany
receivables to be agreed and certain material bank accounts to be agreed;

- all security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets
located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor and no action in relation
to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or registration) will be
required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated; and

- notification of security will only be given to third parties, and security will only be enforceable,
after the occurrence of an acceleration event.

231


-----

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when
determining the extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional
principles which will be reflected in any security taken.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures or will also secure, as applicable, on a first
priority basis the Existing Notes and the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
as well as certain future Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure
certain future indebtedness; provided, however, that pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement
the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain future Hedging
Obligations will receive the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the
holders of the Notes and any Additional Notes. See “—Priority”. See also, “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Creditors under the Revolving_
_Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness_
_permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement_
_ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from_
_the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes”._

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or counterparties to certain
future Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does
not secure the Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
For a brief description of such limitations, see “—Certain Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations”._

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or
at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—
_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations_
_and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_
_Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be_
_repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes”._

**_Priority_**

The relative contractual priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are
created by the Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each a “Security Interest”) as
between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (b) the counterparties
under certain future Hedging Obligations (if any), (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture as well as the trustee and the security agent under the
Existing Notes and the holders thereof and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness
permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, among
other things, that the obligations under the Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement of
security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
such future Hedging Obligations and any future Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a
super-priority basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement are satisfied. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor_
Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged or assigned to
secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens”, “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”._

232


-----

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia,
the payment when due of the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture.
The Security Documents will be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider,
the Security Agent, also as Security Representative, legal representative (mandatario con
_rappresentanza) and (other than for Security Documents governed by Italian law Danish law and_
Spanish law) also as beneficiary of the parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement, and,
with respect to the Italian Security Documents governed by Italian law, the Trustee acting for
itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the Indenture and additionally as common
representative (rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417
and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code, and with respect to Security Documents governed by Danish
law, the Security Agent acting for itself and in its capacity as representative (repræsentant)
pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act, and with respect to Security Documents
governed by Spanish law, the Trustee acting for itself and in its capacity as the Trustee under the
Indenture.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Notes and the Indenture will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all
obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. The validity and
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in
“Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitation on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges.
If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement was successful, the holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral”._

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be
exercised by the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative). Since the holders
will not be a party to the Security Documents, holders will not, individually or collectively, take
any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders
may only act through the Security Agent (including in its role as Security Representative) or the
Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture, holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to
direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security
over the Collateral. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the
holders of the Notes or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release
of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. These limitations are
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law

234


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of the
Security Interest in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) any Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”),_
if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Asset Sales” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or_
(b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (1) (b) shall not be relied upon in the
case of a transfer of capital stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan
receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except, in the case of
accounts receivable, to a Receivables Subsidiary), unless the relevant property and assets
remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following such
sale or disposal);

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or
defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the
covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Merger,_ _Consolidation,_
_Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”;_

(8) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial
repayment or discharge thereof, the security interests created over such receivables will be
automatically reduced in proportion to such partial repayment or discharge and, upon full
repayment or discharge thereof, the security interests shall be automatically and fully
released and of no further effect;

(9) upon the contribution of any claim against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is
subject to a Lien, to the equity of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; provided
that, such contribution is made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) with respect to the Liens securing the Escrowed Property, in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge;

(11) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
or

(12) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released as would
not be prohibited under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest”._

235


-----

At the request and expense of the Issuer, the Security Agent and, to the extent reasonably
requested, the Trustee (if required) will take all necessary action required to effectuate any
release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security
Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action
is required by it to effect such release).

##### Optional Redemption

Except as described under “—Escrow _of_ _Proceeds;_ _Special_ _Mandatory_ _Redemption”,_
_“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the Notes are not redeemable until_, 2022. On
and after, 2022 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Prior to, 2022, the Issuer may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in
part from time to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as
of the date of the redemption notice, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not
including) the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to
or on the redemption date).

##### General

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with
third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms
and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such Affiliates may
determine. The Notes may be optionally redeemed in full or in part pursuant to the optional
redemption provisions of the Indenture described above.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require,
inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the
related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Issuer.

All redemptions of the Notes will be made upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, except that a redemption notice may be made more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for
redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent. The redemption date of any redemption that is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption
may not occur and any notice with respect to such redemption may be modified or rescinded in

236


-----

the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in
its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that,
any such redemption date may not exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice. In
addition, such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been
satisfied or waived by the Issuer by providing notice to the noteholders. In addition, the Issuer
may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

##### Sinking Fund

Except as set forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking_
fund payments with respect to the Notes.

##### Post-Tender Optional Redemption

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase
for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than
30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase, at a price equal to the price
offered (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) to each other holder of Notes
in such tender offer or other offer to purchase (provided that such price shall not be less than
100% of the principal amount), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding such redemption date.

##### Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to (but not including) the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts (as
defined under “—Additional Amounts ”), if any, then due or that will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer determines in good
faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Additional
_Amounts”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any amendment to, an introduction of or change in an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or
rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a government agency or court of
competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

any Payor (as defined under “—Additional Amounts”), with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee
is, or on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes would be,
required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to such Payor (including the appointment of a new Paying Agent
or, where such action would be reasonable, payment through another Payor); provided that no
Payor shall be required to take any measures that in the Issuer’s good-faith determination would
result in the imposition on such person of any material legal or regulatory burden or the
incurrence by such person of additional material costs, or would otherwise result in any material
adverse consequences to such person.

237


-----

In the case of any Payor, the Change in Tax Law with respect to a given Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction must become effective on or after the later of (i) the Issue Date or (ii) the date a
jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notice of redemption will be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the
publication, mailing or delivery of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied (including that the obligation
to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Payor taking reasonable measures
available to it) and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the
effect that the Payor would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in
Tax Law. The Trustee will accept, without further inquiry, such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any
jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the
Indenture.

##### Additional Amounts

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor in interest to
any of the foregoing (each, a “Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other similar governmental charge (collectively,
“Taxes”) unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or any Guarantee is made by
or on behalf of such Payor or the Paying Agent, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor that actually makes a payment on the Notes or its
Guarantee is incorporated or organized, engaged in a business for tax purposes or
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required from
any payments made with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by the noteholders after such withholding or
deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not
be less than the amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments on the
Notes or the Guarantees in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however,
that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant noteholder or the beneficial owner of a
Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over, the relevant noteholder or the beneficial owner, if such noteholder
or the beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being a
citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but

238


-----

excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or
holding of such Notes or the receipt of any payment or exercise of any right under such
Note, the Indenture or a Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied if the holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note had, to the extent legally entitled to do so, complied with a reasonable
request in writing of the Payor (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be payable) to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the noteholder or such beneficial owner
or to make any declaration of non-residence or any other claim or filing or satisfy any
certification, identification, information or reporting requirement for exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of, withholding to which it is entitled (provided that such declaration
of non-residence or other claim, filing or requirement is required by the applicable law,
treaty, regulation or official administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any
such Taxes);

(3) any Taxes, if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if
the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is
required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to
the holder (provided that notice of such payment is given to the holders or beneficial
owners, as applicable), except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment
made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(5) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva pursuant to Italian
Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1, 1996, as amended or supplemented from time to time
(“Decree No. 239”) or pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 461 of November 21, 1997,
as amended or supplemented from time to time (“Decree No. 461”) and any related
implementing regulations, provided that:

(a) Additional Amounts shall be payable in circumstances where the procedures required
under Decree No. 239 or Decree No. 461 in order to benefit from an exemption from
_imposta sostitutiva have not been complied with due solely to the actions or omissions_
of a Payor or its agents; and

(b) for the avoidance of doubt, (1) no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to
any Taxes to the extent that such Taxes result from payment to a non-Italian resident
legal entity or a non-Italian resident individual which are subject to imposta sostitutiva
by reason of not being resident in a country which allows for a satisfactory exchange of
information with Italy (the “White List”) and (2) no Additional Amounts shall be payable
with respect to Taxes to the extent such Taxes are on account of imposta sostitutiva if
the holder or beneficial owner becomes subject to imposta sostitutiva after the Issue
Date by reason of any change in Decree No. 239, Decree No. 461 or any change in the
White List;

(6) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(7) any Taxes payable under or imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as
of the date of this Offering Memorandum (or any amended or successor version), any current
or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into
pursuant thereto, and any intergovernmental agreements implementing the foregoing
(including any legislation or other official guidance relating to such intergovernmental
agreements);

239


-----

(8) any Taxes directly attributable to the failure of the representation in paragraph (13) under
“Transfer Restrictions” to be true with respect to the relevant holder or beneficial owner; or

(9) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable with respect to a noteholder who is a fiduciary
or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that
the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in
accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain and provide
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each relevant taxing authority of each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and
will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Payor to
obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Payor will provide the Trustee with other
reasonable evidence. Such receipts or other evidence will be made available by the Trustee to
holders on written reasonable request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment
made on the Notes or any Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact
that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to holders
on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than
45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter).

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee or this “Description of Notes” there is
mention of, in any context:

(i) the payment of principal;

(ii) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(iii) interest; or

(iv) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under
this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, delivery, issuance, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than, in each case, in connection with a
transfer of the Notes after this offering and limited solely, in the case of such Taxes that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such Taxes that are
not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8)). The foregoing obligations will
survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer by a holder or
beneficial owner and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from
or through which any payment under or with respect to the Notes (or any Guarantee) is made by

240


-----

or on behalf of such payor, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein having the power to tax.

##### Mandatory Redemption

Except as set forth above under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”, the Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund_
payments with respect to the Notes.

##### Selection and Notice

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities
exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of
Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange
prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear, Clearstream or
DTC, as applicable, or Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, prescribes no method of
selection, on a pro rata basis by use of a pool factor; provided, however, that no Note of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in
integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

All notices to holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For Notes which are
represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as
applicable, in substitution for the aforesaid mailing to holders of the Notes.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption on the
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may also be published in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg or by other methods considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the
name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the
case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or
portions of Notes called for redemption.

##### Change of Control

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Issue Date, each holder will have the right
to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash
(the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date), except to the extent the Issuer has
previously elected to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all
conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

241


-----

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a
notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the
Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or, if the Change of Control Offer is being
made in advance of a Change of Control, that a Change of Control is expected to occur, and
that such holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuer to
purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of
purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date);

(2) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute, or are expected to constitute, such Change of Control;

(3) stating that the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days
(unless delivered in advance of the occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such
notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(4) stating that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date and stating that any Note not properly
tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(5) stating that holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to
Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the Paying Agent specified in the
notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require
the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the Paying Agent receives, not later than
the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission
or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes
tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes
and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(7) that if a holder (other than a holder of a global note) is tendering for purchase less than all
of its Notes, the Issuer will issue new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered and the unpurchased portion
of the Notes must be equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof;

(8) stating that if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;
and

(9) the other instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a holder
must follow in order to have its Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a holder of the Notes may exercise its option to elect
for the purchase of the Notes to be made through the facilities of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC,
as applicable, in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn

242


-----

under such Change of Control Offer. Additionally, the Issuer will not be required to make a
Change of Control Offer if the Issuer has previously issued a notice of a full redemption pursuant
to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional Redemption”.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned
upon such Change of Control.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under
this paragraph by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuer or portions thereof validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered;

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions
thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the paying agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have
been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly deliver to
each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive
Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal
amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to a Change of
Control on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in
the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change
in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may also be published in a daily newspaper with
general circulation in Luxembourg or by other methods considered as equivalent by the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

This Change of Control purchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the
Initial Purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future.
Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other
recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that
could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the
Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”,_
“—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens on Intellectual Property”. Such

243


-----

restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained
in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may
afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit
or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a
Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the
Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or
could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the
Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuer will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered
Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of any of the events that constitute a Change of
Control would trigger a change of control under the Existing Indenture. Moreover, the
occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In
addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement
may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer
or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change
of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Additionally, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the
Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.
Moreover, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a body of case law
interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to
purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The term “all or_
_substantially all in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under_
_relevant laws and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a_
_change of control has occurred or will occur”.” In addition, the definition of “Change of Control”_
and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a
transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a
Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of
Control”, may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of Control) with the
written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding.

##### Certain Covenants

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date
following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and (ii) no Default

244


-----

has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension
**Event”), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants or**
provisions (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
_Stock”;_

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Change of Control”;

(6) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(7) “—Impairment of Security Interests”;

(8) “—Future Guarantors”;

(9) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; and

(10) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or
_Substantially all Assets”._

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any
subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status, then
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended
Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion
Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period”. Upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset
at zero. With respect to Restricted Payments made after the Reversion Date, the amount of
Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period. No Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary during the
Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant were in effect during such
period. In addition, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued,
during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause
(b)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described
under “—Transactions with Affiliates”, all agreements and arrangements entered into by the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Issuer during the Suspension Period
prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (16)(ii) of
the second paragraph of “—Transactions with Affiliates”, and for purposes of the covenant
described under “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions affecting Subsidiaries”, all contracts
entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the
restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to
clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions affecting
_Subsidiaries”. In addition, any Change of Control during such Suspension Period shall not require_
a Change of Control Offer during or after the Suspension Period; provided that if the public
notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control occurs during a Suspension
Period and the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status during the period commencing
90 days prior to such notice until the end of the 90 day period following such notice (which
90 day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced
consideration for possible downgrade by at least two of the Rating Agencies) then the Issuer
shall be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the Reversion Date.

245


-----

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such_
covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the Suspension Period.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of
Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended
Covenants during any Suspension Period and the Issuer and any Subsidiary of the Issuer will be
permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended
Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture, to honor, comply
with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into during a
Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated
thereby; provided that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of
a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first
paragraph or the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” and if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be_
deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the
amount pursuant to such clause (c) (so that the amount available under such clause
(c) immediately following such Restricted Payment shall be negative).

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or
Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if
such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken
during the Suspension Period on the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with
their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date;
_provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension or reversion of the_
covenants described hereunder to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will
ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or
issue any shares of Disqualified Stock, and the Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of
Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue shares of Preferred Stock if on the date
of such Incurrence or issuance and after giving effect thereto on a Pro Forma Basis (including
application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been 2.00 to 1.00 or greater; and (2) to the extent that the
Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt Ratio for
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.50 to 1.00; provided,
_further, that the aggregate amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) Incurred_
and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing by Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries shall not exceed the greater of (x) €60 million and (y) 44.5% of Consolidated EBITDA,
at any one time outstanding.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(a) the Incurrence or issuance by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock or the issuance by its Restricted Subsidiaries of Preferred Stock under any
Credit Agreement, the guarantees thereof and the issuance and creation of letters of credit
and bankers’ acceptances thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being
deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an aggregate
outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference, if applicable, (i) not to exceed the
greater of (x) €130 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any

related to the Notes and the Guarantees under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents as well as “parallel debt”
obligations related to any other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the
Indenture; (ii) any Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries and Preferred Stock of its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date
(excluding Indebtedness described in clause (a) or (b)(i) above that is Incurred or existing (or
deemed to be Incurred or existing) on the Issue Date or any Reversion Date), but, for the
avoidance of doubt, including all Capitalized Lease Obligations existing on the Issue Date or
Reversion Date); (iii) Indebtedness Incurred in respect of Management Advances; and (iv) any
loan or other instrument constituting Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and owing to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes and the Guarantees in compliance with the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement contributing the proceeds of the
Notes;

(c) Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Capitalized Lease Obligations and mortgage
financings as purchase money obligations) Incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, Disqualified Stock issued by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and

purchase, lease, construction, installation, repair or improvement of property (real or
personal), plant or equipment or other fixed or capital assets (whether through the direct
purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) and Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock arising from the conversion of the obligations of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under or pursuant to any “synthetic lease” transactions to

deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to this clause (c) but shall be deemed Indebtedness
Incurred and outstanding under the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) in the event that an item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of
more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred or issued under
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, at the time of
Incurrence or issuance, divide, classify or reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify or
reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that all Indebtedness under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Original Acquisition Completion
Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (a) of the definition of

the definition of “Permitted Debt”; (2) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing,
Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of
Indebtedness shall not be included; (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Agreement and are
being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraphs above and the letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such
other Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred
or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that may be issued pursuant to any provision of this
covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth under “—Liens” and “—Liens on
_Intellectual Property” in any case where such amounts are or may be based on Consolidated_
EBITDA (or any ratio of which Consolidated EBITDA is a component), shall not be deemed to be
exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations
in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and such Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced
notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will
continue); (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted

Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility,
enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant
to clause (23) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”, any Permitted Collateral Lien or any
Permitted Intellectual Property Liens, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable, or use of clauses (a) through (ee) of the preceding paragraph (if any)
for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined
on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments
(assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt Ratio, as
applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time,
any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenants
described under “—Liens” and “—Liens on Intellectual Property”, irrespective of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or
re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the
committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of
letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause
(a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Debt Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture, and, to the extent the usage of
clauses (a) through (ee) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and
outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed
pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke
such determination at any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class,
the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of
letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that are otherwise included in the determination of a
particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of
Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee
or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if
such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant)._

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Euro
Equivalent of the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based
on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was committed

253


-----

or Incurred, in the case of term debt, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first
Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt
financing to fund an acquisition, or first issued in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock; provided that; (a) if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be,
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not
to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable,
of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount or
liquidation preference, as applicable, of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date
(with reference to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or the Completion Date (with
reference to the Target Group) (as applicable) shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date (with reference to Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries) or the Completion Date (with reference to Indebtedness of the Target
Group) (as applicable); and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Swap Contract (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts
payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be
adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue
of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis
or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting
different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

Disqualified Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity Interests of
the Issuer or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; or (B) dividends or distributions by a
Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in
respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a
Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its
pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such
class or series of securities);

Indebtedness of either of the Issuer or any Guarantor in anticipation of satisfying a sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of
the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement
and (B) Indebtedness permitted under clause (b)(iv), (f) or (h) of the definition of “Permitted
Debt”); or

consequence thereof;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a Pro Forma Basis, the Issuer could
Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
contained in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and_

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Existing Notes Issue
Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clause (1) of the next succeeding
paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding
paragraph), is less than the sum of, without duplication,

(1) (i) €25 million plus (ii) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period

Restricted Payment, or, in the case that such Consolidated Net Income for such period is
a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit, plus

(2) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and the Fair Market Value of
property, assets (other than cash) or marketable securities, received by the Issuer after

been funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)) that, in each case, has been
converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests in the Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer (other than Excluded Equity), plus

cash and the Fair Market Value of property, assets (other than cash) received by the

(to the extent holders were provided notice in connection with the Asset Sale Offer
related thereto that any Excess Proceeds not accepted by the holders shall constitute
Retained Declined Proceeds and such Retained Declined Proceeds will increase the

covenant to the extent not otherwise applied in accordance with clause (11) of the next
paragraph);

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that
would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to sub-clause (2) or (3) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such
amounts result from the receipt of net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable
securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose and effect of
the receipt of such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce
the Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio of the Issuer so that there would be an occurrence of a
Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of
such net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of
Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture; provided that,

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries”
for purposes of the Indenture and, on the Completion Date, the Target and its subsidiaries are
expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. The Issuer will not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary, or any Unrestricted Subsidiary to
become a Restricted Subsidiary, except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.
For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all
outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid)
in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted
Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of
“Investments”. Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment or Permitted
Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Investment or Restricted Payment (or a
portion thereof) would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above and/or
one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments”, the Issuer
may divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant and may later divide and reclassify any such Investment
or Restricted Payment so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so divided and/or
reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception as of the
date of such reclassification; provided that any Restricted Payment made in reliance on
clause (7)(B) above shall not be permitted to be reclassified as made pursuant to any other
provision described above and shall be deemed at all times to have been made in reliance on
such clause (7)(B).

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the Fair Market Value on the
date of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or
issued by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment.

**_Dividend and other Payment Restrictions affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or

262

connection with the acquisition of assets from such Person (but, in each case, not created in
contemplation thereof)), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or
the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the
Person, so acquired or designated; provided that in connection with a merger, amalgamation
or consolidation under this clause (3), if a Person other than the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary is the successor company with respect to such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation, any agreement or instrument of such Person or any Subsidiary of such Person,
shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, at the time of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing
or Recourse Factoring or Securitization that, in the good faith determination of the Issuer, is
necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing or Recourse Factoring or
Securitization (as applicable);

(10) any encumbrance or restriction (a) contained in other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is Incurred subsequent to the
Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; provided that such_
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument, taken as a whole,
(i) will not materially affect the Issuer’s ability to make anticipated principal or interest
payments on the Notes (as determined by the Issuer or a direct or indirect parent of the
Issuer in good faith); (ii) are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Notes, the Existing Notes, the
Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the

indirect parent of the Issuer in good faith); or (iii) as is customary in comparable financings
(as determined by the Issuer or a direct or indirect parent of the Issuer in good faith) or
where the Issuer determines that such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect in
any material respect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;
or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under the covenants
described under “—Liens” and “—Liens on Intellectual Property” to the extent limiting the
right of the debtor to dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not
relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, (a) detract
from the value of the property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any
manner material to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) materially affect the Issuer’s
ability to make future principal or interest payments on the Notes, in each case, as
determined by the Issuer in good faith;

(13) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar
agreements or arrangements relating solely to the applicable joint venture;

contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract; (b) contained
in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture
or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the

instruments or obligations referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) through (15)
of this second paragraph of this covenant; provided that such encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing are, in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and
restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock
in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions
being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make
distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any such Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair
Market Value (as determined at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the
assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash
or Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets,

_provided that the amount of:_

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet or in the notes thereto for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding such date or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the
date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s
or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such
incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet in the
good faith determination of the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (other
than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are extinguished
in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale, or that are assumed by
the transferee of any such assets or Equity Interests, in each case, pursuant to an
agreement that releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, from further liability;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be

of any Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Net
Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) (a) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a) of the

_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; (b) unless included in_
(1)(a), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (i) any Notes and/or (ii) any Indebtedness (other

Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement has priority status in respect of the
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral) in the case of clause (1)(b)(ii), at a price of
no more than 100% of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (c) prepay, repay, purchase
or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any
Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other
than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that, the Issuer will prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem Capital Markets Debt (other than the Notes) pursuant to this clause (1) only if the
Issuer either (A) equally and ratably reduces Obligations under the Notes as provided under
“—Optional Redemption” or through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases
are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or (B) makes an offer (in accordance
with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a
purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, the principal amount of Notes that would otherwise be redeemed under
sub-clause (A) above);

(2) purchase any Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of such Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject
to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) or redeem any Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions
of the Indenture or by making an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of the Notes (in accordance
with the procedures set out below); provided, however, that to the extent the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less
than par, to the extent holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer
will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Cash Proceeds equal to such amount not
tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, assets (other than working capital
assets), or property or capital expenditures, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business;

(4) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, properties (other than working capital
assets) or assets (other than working capital assets) that replace the businesses, properties
and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(5) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the_
provisions described in clause (3) or (4) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within
365 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as applicable, has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement
to make an investment in compliance with the provision described in clauses (3) or (4) of this

266

paragraph, and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such
365-day period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any of or all the Net Cash Proceeds of any
Asset Sales by a Subsidiary (x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being
repatriated to Italy, Denmark or Spain or (y) would have a material adverse tax consequence
(taking into account any foreign tax credit or other net benefit actually realized in connection
with such repatriation that would not otherwise be realized), as determined by the Issuer in its
sole discretion, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable
Subsidiary; provided that clause (x) of this paragraph shall apply to such amounts so long, but
only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to Italy, Denmark or Spain
(the Issuer hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable
organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation to Italy, Denmark
or Spain), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under
the applicable local law and is not subject to clause (y) of this paragraph, then, such repatriation
will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied (net of
additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) in compliance with this covenant.
The time periods set forth in this covenant shall not start until such time as the Net Cash Proceeds
may be repatriated to Italy, Denmark or Spain (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs).

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if
any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture. The Indenture will provide that any amount of Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale
that is not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second
paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any
amount of proceeds offered to holders pursuant to clause (1)(c) or clause (2) of the second
paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer made at any time after the Asset
Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be deemed to be Excess
Proceeds without regard to the extent to which such offer is accepted by the holders. When the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds less Total Leverage Excess Proceeds (as defined below), if
any, exceeds €20 million, the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of
Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds less Total Leverage Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other
Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if
any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date
fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture
and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. However, the Issuer shall only be
required to make an Asset Sale Offer with 50% of the Excess Proceeds if the Consolidated Total
Net Debt Ratio for the Issuer is less than or equal to the Specified Consolidated Total Net Debt
Ratio after giving effect to any application of any Net Cash Proceeds as set forth herein, including
completion of any prior offer to repurchase a portion of the Notes (any Excess Proceeds not
required to be offered in an Asset Sale Offer in reliance on this sentence (i.e., such 50%) shall
constitute “Total Leverage Excess Proceeds”). The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that such Excess Proceeds less
any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceed €20 million by transmitting electronically or by
mailing to the holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to
the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as
applicable. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Net Cash
Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash

267


-----

Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Cash Proceeds before the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceeds €20 million.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness
tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess
Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale
Offer, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds
(any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered
or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer,
the Trustee shall select the Notes (and the Issuer or its agents shall select such Pari Passu
Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent the Excess
Proceeds less any Total Leverage Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the
Issuer needs only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds less any Total
Leverage Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used
for any purpose in the Issuer’s discretion. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such
laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an
Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the
written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit
or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the
Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates could seek the
consent of its lenders or investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates do not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such
case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under
the Indenture.

If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuer is required to
purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements
of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the
Trustee knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the
total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale
Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of
€100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof shall be purchased) by lot or by such
other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies
with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of Global Notes, the procedures of the
Depository); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with a
principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of €100,000. No Note will be
repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left
outstanding.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent
electronically, at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each
holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with Euroclear,

268


-----

Clearstream or DTC procedures, as applicable. If any Note is to be purchased in part only, any
notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof that has been or is to be purchased.

A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a
global note) purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation
of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the
purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into
or make or amend any transaction or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding,
loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer involving
aggregate consideration in excess of €10 million (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate
**Transaction”), unless:**

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an
arm’s-length basis (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer); and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of €25 million, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a
resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or
any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, approving such Affiliate Transaction, together
with an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct
or indirect parent of the Issuer determined or resolved that such Affiliate Transaction
complies with clause (a) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or an
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or
among any Restricted Subsidiary or any Receivables Subsidiary and (b) any merger,
amalgamation or consolidation of the Issuer and any Holdings Entity or any other direct or
indirect parent of the Issuer;

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Equity Interests, options, other
equity-related investments or other warrants or securities or right to purchase Equity
Interests, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or
the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective
bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other
similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities
provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved or ratified by
the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) (a) Restricted Payments permitted by the Indenture and (b) Permitted Investments;

(4) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such
transaction is fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or
meets the requirements of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

out-of-pocket expenses or payments under any indemnity obligations) contemplated

obligations under the terms of, the Acquisition Agreement, any stockholders or similar
agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related
thereto) to which it is a party entered into in connection with the Transactions or similar
transactions, arrangements or agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided,
_however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries of its obligations under, any future amendment to any such existing transaction,
arrangement or agreement or under any similar transaction, arrangement or agreement
entered into after the Completion Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the
extent that the terms of any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement, together
with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction, arrangement or
agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the senior
management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the
Issuer) to the holders of the Notes, in any material respect when taken as a whole as
compared with the original transaction, arrangement or agreement entered into in
connection with the Transactions;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of
the Indenture, which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or are on terms at
least as favorable (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of
Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) as might reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

respect of other investment banking activities, including, without limitation, in connection

the Initial Investors or (y) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or
any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer in good faith or a majority of the disinterested
members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer
in good faith;

(12) any contribution to the capital of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or any
investments by any Initial Investor or a direct or indirect parent of the Issuer in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock of the Issuer) of the Issuer (and payment of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Initial Investor or a direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer in connection therewith);

(13) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute
an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity
Interest in or otherwise controls such Person; provided that no Affiliate of the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial
interest or otherwise participate in such Person;

each case, as these agreements, arrangements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance

**_Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness on any of
its assets or property (excluding Intellectual Property), whether owned on or acquired after the
Issue Date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom (such Lien, the “Initial
**Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,**
(1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and
the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly
secured equally and ratably with, or senior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b), in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes or the applicable Guarantee pursuant to the
preceding paragraphs shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) at
the same time as the release of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) as otherwise set forth
under—Security—Release of Liens.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness
at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure
any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall
mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest,
the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue
discount or liquidation preference, any fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest,

272


-----

premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the
amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Liens on Intellectual Property_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness for
borrowed money on any of its Intellectual Property, whether owned on or acquired after the
Issue Date (such Lien, the “Initial Intellectual Property Lien”), except (1)(a) Liens on Intellectual
Property of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary securing obligations, the principal amount of
which does not exceed the greater of (x) €15 million and (y) 11.25% Consolidated EBITDA at any
one time outstanding, and (b) Liens on Intellectual Property described in one or more of clauses
(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) (to the extent not securing Indebtedness for borrowed money), (7), (8),
(12), (13), (19), (20), (22) (in respect of Liens permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens” to the extent not securing Indebtedness for borrowed money), (28), (29), (30),
(33), (36), (38), (40), (42), (43), (44) and (48) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or (c) Liens on
Intellectual Property described in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Liens securing
Indebtedness for borrowed money that will be repaid and discharged in connection with the
Transactions and (2) Liens on Intellectual Property that are not otherwise permitted under this
covenant if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee of the Notes in the case of Liens of a
Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with
respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness for borrowed money secured by such
Initial Intellectual Property Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured (clauses (1) and (2),
together, “Permitted Intellectual Property Liens”).

Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes or the applicable Guarantee pursuant to the
preceding paragraph shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) at
the same time as the release of the Initial Intellectual Property Lien to which it relates and (ii) as
otherwise set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness for borrowed money that was permitted to
secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also
be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant (x) a Lien need not be Incurred solely
by reference to one category of Permitted Intellectual Property Liens described herein but may
be Incurred under any combination of such categories (including in part under one such category
and in part under any other such category) and (y) in the event that a Lien (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of such categories of Permitted Intellectual Property
Liens, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify such Lien (or any portion thereof)
in any manner that complies with this covenant.

**_Reports_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to
the Trustee a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or
director changes at the Issuer or the parent of the Issuer responsible for the management of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report
containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that any reports provided under clauses (1), (2) and (3) above delivered to the_
Trustee via e-mail or other electronic means shall be deemed to have been “furnished” to the
Trustee in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the

persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all
reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF
Market thereof and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, by posting such reports on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the
date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and
on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such
information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in
the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No
report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any

274


-----

not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will
not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent or IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized
Stock Exchange and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such
Recognized Stock Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the holders
such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such direct or
indirect parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such Recognized Stock
Exchange pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirements, and provided, that such requirements require the Issuer or any direct or
indirect parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and
other reports with the Recognized Stock Exchange, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied
with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs; provided further, that if such
Recognized Stock Exchange does not require the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the
Issuer or IPO Entity to (a) prepare and file reports with such Recognized Stock Exchange or
(b) disclose Consolidated EBITDA, in each case, on a quarterly basis, the Issuer shall additionally
provide the reports set forth in clause (2) of the first paragraph above and disclose Consolidated
EBITDA on a quarterly basis.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1), (2) and
(3) of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual, quarterly and ad hoc
reports of (i) any direct or indirect parent company or (ii) Flos S.p.A, B&B Italia S.p.A. and Danish
HoldCo. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets,
shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer and (i) any direct or
indirect parent company or (i) Flos S.p.A, B&B Italia and Danish HoldCo, as the case may be, that
is or are the reporting entity or entities (if applicable), the annual, quarterly and ad hoc reports
shall include an explanation and an unaudited reconciliation of such material differences.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “—Reports” covenant will include (i) a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate
from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, together with an unaudited reconciliation to
the financial information of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the
following items: revenues, consolidated EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt,
shareholder equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to
the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and prospective holders of the Notes if such information
referenced in clauses (1), (2) or (3) of this covenant (i) has been posted to the Issuer’s website or
(ii) made publicly available through substantially comparable means (as determined by an Officer
of the Issuer in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such reports
available on Bloomberg or another private electronic information service will constitute
substantially comparable public availability).

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be made in the English
language. If the due date for any report set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above is not a Business
Day, the Issuer or other reporting entity permitted under this covenant will be entitled to
provide such report on the next succeeding Business Day.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to

275


-----

file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the
provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls
and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file
with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing
requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the
preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Future Guarantors_**

If, on or after the Issue Date, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not then a
Guarantor guarantees or Incurs any Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
or guarantees any capital markets Indebtedness with an aggregate principal amount in excess of
€75 million (“Certain Capital Markets Debt”) of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
Incurs Certain Capital Markets Debt or (b) the Issuer otherwise elects to have any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer become a Guarantor, then, in each such case, the Issuer shall cause such
Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Indenture providing for a
Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in
the Indenture and applicable to the other Guarantors; provided that, in the case of clause (a),
such supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered to the Trustee within 20 Business
Days of the date that such Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or such
Certain Capital Markets Debt has been guaranteed or Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a_
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the
Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations
(or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors
or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At
the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to reflect the foregoing.

Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable
jurisdiction and defenses generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those
relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations and
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
This includes limiting Guarantees to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such
Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law. However, such limitations may not be
effective under local law. See “—Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees_ _and_ _the_ _Collateral_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_ _Considerations”_ _and_ _“Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitation on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_
_enforceability”._

276


-----

Each Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture described under “—Guarantees”.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of
obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting
of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or
other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. By virtue of
such limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Guarantee. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests
and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” in the_
Offering Memorandum.

**_Further Assurances_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:
(i) (a) cause each of the Initial Guarantors to become Guarantors within 20 Business Days
following the Issue Date and (b) cause each of the U.S. Guarantors to become Guarantors within
90 days following the Completion Date, in each case limited as necessary to reflect limitations
under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and defenses generally available to guarantors in
such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, “thin
capitalization” rules and similar laws, regulations and defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law, and (ii) enter or cause the entry into the
relevant Security Documents to effect (a) the Initial Collateral within five Business Days following
the Issue Date, (b) the Post Issue Date Collateral within 20 Business Days following the Issue Date
and (c) the Post Completion Date Collateral within 90 days following the Completion Date.

In addition, none of the Issuer, B&B Italia S.p.A., Flos S.p.A. and Danish Holdco, as applicable, may
amend any Intercompany Loan in a manner materially adverse to the holders (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer).

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Each of Holdco and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood,
subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders, and Holdco and the Issuer shall not, and Holdco
and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the
Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) Holdco
and the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement,
release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) Holdco and the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend,
extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization or a transaction not
prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of
_all or Substantially all Assets”, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance_
with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended
from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein

277


-----

and (v) Holdco and Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any
manner that does not adversely affect holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in
the case of clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (a) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of Holdco and the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (as applicable), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (b) a
certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Issuer or the relevant Person
granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
or (c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens
created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, each of the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being
indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the holders.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or clauses (a), (c) (other than with respect to_
Capitalized Lease Obligations), (i), (k), (l), (n), (q) or (cc) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock” and (y) any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of the Indebtedness_
referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional **Intercreditor**
**Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor**
Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not
materially less favorable to the holders), including containing substantially the same terms with
respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security
Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such
agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of
payment to the Notes), (3) add a co-issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor

278


-----

Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including
Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Liens, Permitted Intellectual Property Liens or
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not
otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of the majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
_“—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or_
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities
under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided,
_however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation_
_on Restricted Payments”._

The Indenture also will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets_**

_The Issuer_

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may not consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or
into or wind up into (whether or not such Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) in one or more related transactions, to
any Person unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
merger, amalgamation or winding up (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is (or is the
foreign analog of) a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company
or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory
thereof or the District of Columbia, the laws of Canada or any province of Canada, Norway,
Switzerland or any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the
Existing Notes Issue Date) (the Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called
the “Successor Company”);

(2) the Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of the
Issuer (a) under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other
documents or instruments and (b) under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, as applicable;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a

279


-----

result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a Pro Forma Basis, as if such
transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either:

(a) the Issuer (or a Successor Company to the Issuer, if applicable) would be permitted to
Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio contained in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or_

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer (or a Successor Company to the Issuer, if
applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than such ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by
supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s
Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such
supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture; provided that, in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

The Successor Company (if other than the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, the
Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, and the Issuer will automatically be
released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) the Issuer may consolidate or amalgamate
with, merge into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its
properties and assets to any Guarantor, (b) the Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate
with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing the Issuer
in another state of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway, Switzerland or in any member country of the
European Union (as it is constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date) so long as the principal
amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby
(unless such increase is permitted by the Indenture), (c) the Issuer may change legal form, (d) the
Issuer or any Guarantor may change its name, (e) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with the Issuer; provided that the Issuer is the Successor Company in
such merger, amalgamation or consolidation and (f) the Issuer may enter into a Permitted
Reorganization.

_The Guarantors_

The Indenture will further provide that subject to certain provisions in the Indenture governing
release of a Guarantee upon the sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor,
each Guarantor will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, consolidate, merge or
amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person (other than in
connection with the Transactions) unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, merger, amalgamation or winding up (if other than such Guarantor) or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been
made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company or trust,
or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any

280


-----

state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway, Switzerland or any member country of the European Union (as it is
constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a
Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is
substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of
formation of the predecessor Guarantor (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be,
being herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(a) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the
obligations of such Guarantor under the Indenture, the Security Documents (as
applicable), the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and such Guarantor’s Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other
documents or instruments;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that
becomes an obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; and

(c) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to
be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; or

(2) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is made in compliance
with the covenant described under “—Asset Sales” to the extent applicable on the date of
the subject transaction,

_provided, however, that the prohibitions contained in the first paragraph of the covenant_
described under “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all
_Assets—The Guarantors” shall not apply to the extent that compliance with paragraphs_
(1)(a) and (1)(b) could give rise to or result in: (i) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (ii) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors
or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (iii) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to,
and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture, the Security Documents (as
applicable), the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and such
Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from
its obligations under the Indenture, the Security Documents (as applicable), the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and such Guarantor’s Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Guarantor may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an
Affiliate of the Issuer incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing such Guarantor in the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of
Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway, Switzerland or in any member country of
the European Union (as it is constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date), so long as the principal
amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby
(unless such increase is permitted by the Indenture), (2) a Guarantor may (a) consolidate, merge
or amalgamate with or into or wind up into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to, the Issuer or a Guarantor or
(b) dissolve if such Guarantor sells, assigns, transfers, leases, conveys or otherwise disposes of all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to another Person in compliance with the covenant

281

described under “—Asset Sales” and after giving effect on a Pro Forma Basis to such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition and prior to such dissolution, has no or a
_de minimis amount of assets, (3) a Guarantor may change legal form under the laws of the_
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or
territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway, Switzerland or any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the
Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided
under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under
the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of such Guarantor prior to such conversion, (4) a
Guarantor may change its name, (5) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge, amalgamate or
consolidate into any Guarantor; provided, in the case of this clause (5), that the surviving Person
(i) is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company or trust, or the
foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the
United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of Canada or
any province of Canada, Norway, Switzerland or any member country of the European Union (as
it is constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a
Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially
equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the
predecessor Guarantor or the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Restricted
Subsidiary or Guarantor and (ii) is or becomes a Guarantor upon consummation of such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation and (6) any Guarantor may enter into a Permitted
Reorganization.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

##### Defaults

An Event of Default with respect to the Notes will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days;

above) contained the Notes or the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to comply
with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period
of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in
this clause (3) has been given;

(4) (x) the failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay the principal amount of any

Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)

(5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of Holdco, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary;

or judgments are covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by
any creditor upon such judgment or judgments or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and
except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent)
with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €25 million for any reason
other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any
such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer
shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each
case) any such Default continues for 10 days; or

(8) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as
contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture), or any Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or
gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination or discharge of
the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and
such Default continues for ten days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of
Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant
to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (3), (4) or (6) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an
Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes notify in writing the Issuer of the Default and such Default is not cured within
the time specified in such clauses after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing with respect to the Notes, the Trustee or the
holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer
(and to the Trustee, if given by holders of the Notes) may declare the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes outstanding to be due and payable. Upon such
a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately.
If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer occurs,
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the outstanding Notes will become
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or
any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration and its consequences. Please see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes”._

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice
to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any
declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the
Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium
on, or the principal of, the Notes (other than such non-payment of principal or interest that has
become due as a result of such acceleration) or (ii) subject to “—Amendments and Waivers”,

283


-----

waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees if, in each
case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver, rescission or cancellation would not conflict with any
judgment or decree. Upon any such waiver of a Default or an Event of Default effected pursuant
to clause (i) of the previous sentence, such Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such
Event of Default and all consequences thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded,
automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, if prior to 30
days after such Event of Default arose (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such
Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount of holders thereof have
rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such
Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been
cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect
to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in respect
of any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture
or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture,
the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking
such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the
Trustee, the Trustee must deliver to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default within 90 days
after it is known to the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
premium (if any) or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the
Notes. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end

284


-----

of each fiscal year (starting with the fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), a certificate
regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of the Issuer becoming aware of any
Default or Event of Default, the Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days
after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or
Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period), an Officer’s
Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

##### Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions and subject to compliance with the provisions described in
“—Meetings of Holders of Notes” below, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any existing or past Default or compliance with any provisions of such
documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes). However,
without the consent of holders holding not less than 75% of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Notes, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes
held by a non-consenting holder:

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes whose holders must
consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any,
on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes with respect to a
non-payment default by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration;

(5) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which
any Note may be redeemed as described under “—Optional Redemption” (other than, in
each case, any change to the notice periods with respect to such redemptions) or
“—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(6) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(7) impair the right of any holder of Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment
on or with respect to such holder’s Notes;

(8) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
Events of Default or the rights of holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes;

(9) make the Notes or any Guarantee subordinated in right of payment to any other obligations;

(10) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral other
than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents;

(11) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor agreement; or

(12) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions of the Indenture that require the
holder’s consent as described in clauses (1) through (11) of this sentence;

285


-----

A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer holds
the Note; provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of
outstanding Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver hereunder, Notes owned by the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer shall be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding if such ownership is known by a Trust Officer.

Without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a
Guarantee or the Indenture to which it is a party), the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency,

(2) conform the text of the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture or other
instrument pursuant to which Additional Notes are issued), the Guarantees, the Notes or the
Security Documents to this “Description of Notes” or, with respect to any Additional Notes
and any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Additional
Notes are issued, to the “Description of Notes” relating to the issuance of such Additional
Notes solely to the extent that such “Description of Notes” provides for terms of such
Additional Notes that differ from the terms of the initial Notes, as contemplated by
“—General” above,

(3) comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of
assets,

(4) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes or Guarantee, as the case may be,

(5) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; provided that
the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the
Code,

(6) (A) add or release Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (B) add a
co-issuer of the Notes to the extent it does not result in adverse tax consequences to the
holders,

(7) add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

(8) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material
respect,

(9) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of the Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to
facilitate the issuance and administration of the Notes; _provided,_ _however,_ that
(i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred
in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes,

(10) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee; provided
that the successor Trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms
of the Indenture,

(11) provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture,

(12) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or
Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the
Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes Document,

(13) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders or parties to the

286


-----

Revolving Credit Facility or holders of the Existing Notes, in any property which is required by
the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest
is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with, or_

(14) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinion of
Counsel.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of “—Change of
_Control” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to_
impair or affect any rights of holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such
exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in
Luxembourg on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent
and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Such notice of any
amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg or by other methods considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange.

##### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control
with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

##### Meeting of Holders of Notes

All meetings of holders of the Notes (or each series of Notes, if applicable) will be held in
accordance with Italian applicable laws and regulations.

In addition to and without prejudice to the provisions described above under the caption
“—Amendments and Waivers”, in accordance with the provisions set forth under the Italian Civil
Code, the Indenture will include provisions for the convening of meetings of the holders of the
Notes to consider any matter affecting their interests, including, without limitation, the
modification or abrogation by extraordinary resolution of any provisions of the Notes or the
Indenture. A meeting may be convened either (i) by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, (ii) by
the Noteholders’ Representative (as defined below) or (iii) upon request by holders of at least
5.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

In accordance with the Italian Civil Code, the vote required to pass a resolution by a meeting of
the holders of Notes will be (i) in the case of the first meeting, one or more persons that hold or
represent holders of more than one half of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes, and (ii) in the case of the second and any further adjourned meeting, one or more persons
that hold or represent holders of at least two-thirds of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes so present or represented at such meeting. Any such second or further adjourned meeting
will be validly held if there are one or more persons present that hold or represent holders of
more than one-third of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; provided,

287


-----

_however, that the Issuer’s bylaws may provide for a higher quorum (to the extent permitted_
under Italian law). Certain proposals, as set out under Article 2415 paragraph 1, item 2, and
paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (namely, the amendment of the economic terms and
conditions of the Notes) may only be approved by an extraordinary resolution passed at a
meeting of holders of the Notes (including any adjourned meeting) by one or more persons
present that hold or represent holders of not less than one-half of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes.

With respect to the matters set forth in the second paragraph under “—Amendments and
_Waivers” and to the extent permitted under Italian law, the Indenture will contractually increase_
the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes otherwise required by Article 2415 of
the Italian Civil Code to pass an extraordinary resolution with respect to such matters from 50%
to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Issuer may amend the economic terms and_
_conditions of the Notes without the prior consent of all noteholders with the vote of either 75%_
_or 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes”. Any resolution duly passed_
at any such meeting shall be binding on all the holders of the Notes, whether or not such holder
was present at such meeting or voted to approve such resolution. To the extent provided by the
Italian Civil Code, the resolutions passed by a meeting of holders of the Notes can be challenged
by holders pursuant to Articles 2377 and 2379 of the Italian Civil Code.

The Indenture will provide that the provisions described under this “—Meeting of Holders of
_Notes” will be in addition to, and not in substitution of, the provisions described under the_
caption “—Amendments and Waivers”. As such and notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment, supplement and/or waiver, in addition to complying with the provisions described
under this “—Meeting of Holders of Notes” must also comply with the other provisions described
under “—Amendments and Waivers”.

##### Security Representative and Noteholders’ Representative

Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance and
purchase of the Notes on the Issue Date shall be deemed to constitute the authorization and
agreement on behalf of the holders of the Notes of the initial appointment as of the Issue Date
of UniCredit S.p.A., as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3,
of the Italian Civil Code (the “Security Representative”) in order to create and grant in its favor
security interests and guarantees securing and guaranteeing the Notes and entitle it to exercise
in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes all their rights (including any rights before
any court and judicial proceedings) relating to such security interests and guarantees. Pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture each holder of the Notes from time to time, by accepting a Note, shall
be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the appointment of UniCredit S.p.A. as Security
Representative.

Moreover, a representative of the holders of the Notes (rappresentante comune) (the
“Noteholders’ Representative”) may be appointed pursuant to Articles 2415 and 2417 of the
Italian Civil Code by the holders of the Notes in order to represent the interests of the holders of
the Notes pursuant to Article 2418 of the Italian Civil Code as well as to give effect to resolutions
passed at a meeting of the holders of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
execution of the Indenture and the issuance and purchase of the Notes on the Issue Date shall be
deemed to constitute the authorization and agreement on behalf of the holders of the Notes of
the initial appointment as of the Issue Date of The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc as the
Noteholders’ Representative. If the Noteholders’ Representative is not appointed by a meeting of
the holders of the Notes, the Noteholders’ Representative shall be appointed by a decree of the
Court where the Issuer has its registered office upon request by one or more holders of the Notes
or upon request by the directors of the Issuer. The Noteholders’ Representative remains
appointed for a maximum period of three financial years but may be subsequently reappointed
thereafter.

##### No Personal Liability of Managers, Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or holder of any equity
interests in the Issuer, Holdco, any Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, as
such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes or
the Indenture or any Guarantee or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

##### Transfer and Exchange

A noteholder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any
transfer or exchange, the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other
things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and the Issuer may require a
noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The registrar will not
be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption (except in the case of a
Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of such Note not to be redeemed) or to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Notes to be redeemed or
tendered and not withdrawn or in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale
Offer. The Notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be
treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes.

##### Satisfaction and Discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be
discharged and will cease to be of further effect and any collateral then securing the Notes shall
be released (except as to surviving rights of conversion, transfer or exchange of Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when:

(1) either (a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has
theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and
thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their
Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption or are to be called
for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of a full redemption by the Trustee or Paying Agent in the name, and at the
expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor have deposited or caused to be
deposited in a manner that is not revocable by the Issuer or any of its Affiliates with the
Trustee or paying agent money or European Government Obligations in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, together with
irrevocable instructions from the Issuer directing the Trustee or paying agent to apply such
funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Issuer and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums then due and payable under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.

289


-----

##### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture and
have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“legal defeasance”)
and cure all then-existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below) and obligations to register the transfer
or exchange of the Notes and certain rights of the Trustee, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. Subject to
the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the
holders of Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust). The Issuer
at any time may terminate its obligations and those of each Guarantor under certain covenants
that are described in the Indenture, including the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants”, the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with_
respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision described under “—Defaults”
and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”_
(other than clauses (1), (2) and (6) of the first paragraph and clause (1)(d) of the third paragraph
thereof) (“covenant defeasance”). If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its
covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with
respect to its Guarantee.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its
covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer
exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (with respect to any Default by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries with any of their obligations under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants”, (4), (5), (6) or (7) under “—Defaults”.

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to the Notes, the Issuer must
irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited (the “defeasance trust”) with the Paying Agent
money or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof (sufficient in the opinion
of a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm) for the payment of principal,
premium (if any) and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be;
_provided that if such redemption is made pursuant to the provisions described in the second_
paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”, then: (x) the amount of money or European
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, that the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or
cause to be deposited will be determined using an assumed Applicable Premium calculated as of
the date of such deposit, as calculated by the Issuer in good faith, and (y) the Issuer must
irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited additional money in trust on the redemption date as
necessary to pay the Applicable Premium as determined on such date; provided, further, that the
Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion
of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that holders of the
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount
and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal
income tax law after the Issue Date).

##### Financial Calculations

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture in connection
with any transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any
Incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of any Investment, Restricted
Payment or Restricted Payments permitted pursuant to any of clauses (1) through (24) of the

290


-----

covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, any Asset Sale or other
disposition, any acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination
and any other transaction requiring the testing of any basket based on the Consolidated EBITDA
of the Issuer), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of
Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such
transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma
adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth
in the definition of “Pro Forma Basis” and “Consolidated EBITDA” after giving effect to such
transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning
of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such
transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a
result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated
Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or that arises from an asset or a target company
subject to such transaction) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have
been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
transaction is permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time
of consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided that if the Issuer elects to
have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such
transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall
be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of
such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction. To the extent the date of
determination of a basket or ratio is tested prior to the date of consummation of a transaction,
such basket or ratio shall be deemed utilized to the same extent until the earlier of the date of
consummation of such transaction or the date such transaction is terminated or expires without
consummation, except that in the case of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, any calculation
of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes other than Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or the
making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition, merger or consolidation) shall
not reflect such transaction until it has been consummated.

##### Notices

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be
published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and
in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In addition, for so long
as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes will be delivered
by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may also be published in
a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such
publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in
Europe) or by other methods considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

All notices to holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as
any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and if and for so long as the rules
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange of any notice with respect to the Notes.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
_provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later_
of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication
mailed to a holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means
and shall be sufficiently given to such holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with

is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. For so long as any Notes are represented
by Global Notes, all notices to holders of the Notes may be delivered via Euroclear, Clearstream
or DTC, as applicable, in lieu of notice via registered mail.

##### Concerning the Trustee

The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture.
During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care
that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee
or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
taxes, expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

##### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed
five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

##### Governing Law

The Indenture will provide that it and the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement
and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

##### Enforceability of Judgments

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and Guarantors are outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issue or certain Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, redemption price
and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectible within the United States.

292


-----

See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

##### Consent to Jurisdiction and Service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture
and the Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture
(1) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, United States and (2) consent that any
such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waive any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that
such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agree not to plead or claim
the same.

##### Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, if any, including
damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result
of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up
or dissolution of the Issuer or any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee or
Paying Agent, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the
euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make
that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee or Paying Agent under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify
them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the
Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several
basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or
the Trustee or Paying Agent to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will
apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee or Paying Agent
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum
due under any Note or any Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is committed, Incurred or made, as the case may
be.

under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based
upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as

the Issuer (or any successor thereto) or any Restricted Subsidiary, net of the amount of actual
benefits realized or expected to be realized during such period that are otherwise included in the

expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies are reasonably identifiable (as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer, in his or her capacity as

direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) that is expected to result in such cost savings, expense

registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes”
and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global
Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common
Depositary.

Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered global form in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be
issued at the closing of the Offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such
participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the
Indenture governing the Notes and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United
States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes
on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names
on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described
below, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants.
The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not
be considered the “holders” of Notes for any purpose under the Indenture.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or its nominee) will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of
their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

##### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the

344


-----

Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the
Registrar for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will
request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global
Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such
partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The
Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all
of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions)
or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

##### Payments on Global Notes

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying
Agent, who will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent
and the Registrar will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, nor any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

##### Currency of payment for the Global Notes

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or
Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the
Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of
a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment.

##### Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the

345


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if
there is an event of default under the Notes (as defined under “Description of Notes—Events of
_Default”), each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for_
definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

##### Transfers

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants,
which rules and procedures may change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions”. Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements as discussed in “Transfer restrictions”.

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book- Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the
legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer
_restrictions”._

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S.
Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Restricted Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under “Transfer restrictions”, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state
of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book- Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
LuxSE and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global

346


-----

Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating
procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

##### Definitive registered notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes if:

- Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary for the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor depositary within
120 days;

- Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

- the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its
current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in
“Transfer restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar
and the Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the
part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing,
printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered
Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the
Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if such Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer and

347


-----

the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to
furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us,
the Trustee and authenticating agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive
Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to
the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new
Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case
may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Transfer restrictions”.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the LuxSE and the rules of the LuxSE so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a
newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which we expect to be the Luxemburger
_Wort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered_
Notes will be payable at the office of the paying agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are
listed on the Official List of the LuxSE and the rules of the LuxSE so require.

##### Global clearance and settlement under the Book-Entry system

**_Initial settlement_**
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**
You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United
States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a
payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day may find that the transactions will not be
performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if
Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**
We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes
are set out under “Listing and general information”.

348


-----

**_Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**
All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The following description of the operations and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and
procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to
changes by them. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent or the Registrar take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and
we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

_Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the_
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

_Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their_
_account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn_
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial
interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry
practices, if either the Issuer or Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or
if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to
give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants
owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would
authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

_receipt of interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any_
_interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, Italian, United States, or Danish_

_law that may take effect after such date, including on a retroactive basis. References in this_
_section to holders of the Notes include the beneficial owners of the Notes. Terms defined under_
_each subsection related to Italian, United States and Danish tax law below only have such_
_meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The statements regarding the laws and_
_practices of Italy and the United States set forth below assume that the Notes will be issued, and_

purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes for Italian resident and non-Italian resident
beneficial owners, although it is not intended to be, nor should it be constructed to be, legal or

tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes
and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors,
some of which (such as dealers in securities or commodities) may be subject to special rules.
Neither the Issuer nor any other entity belonging to the Target Group will update this summary
to reflect changes in law or in the interpretation thereof and, if any such change occurs, the
information in this summary could be superseded.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

_Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Italian Legislative Decree No. 239 of April 1,1996, as amended and supplemented (“Decree
No. 239”), regulates the tax treatment of interest, premiums and other income (including the
difference between the redemption amount and the issue price) (hereinafter collectively referred
to as “Interest”) from Notes to the extent: (i) Notes are issued by, inter alia, companies, whose
shares are listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading platform of EU Member
States and of the states party to the EEA Agreement included in the list of States allowing an
adequate exchange of information with the Italian tax authorities, as indicated by the Italian
Ministerial Decree of September 4, 1996, as subsequently amended and supplemented and
possibly further amended by future decrees issued pursuant to Article 11 par. 4 (c) of Decree
No. 239 (the “White List States”); or (ii) Notes are listed on a qualifying regulated market or on a
multilateral trading platform of EU Member States and of the states party to the EEA Agreement
of White List States; or (iii) Notes are only held by qualified investors (as defined under Article
100 of the Italian Securities Act). The provisions of Decree No. 239 only apply to Notes which
qualify as obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni pursuant to Article 44 of Italian
Presidential Decree No. 917 of December 22, 1986, as amended and supplemented (“Decree
**No. 917”). Pursuant to Article 44 of Decree No. 917, for securities to qualify as titoli similari alle**

350


-----

_obbligazioni (securities similar to bonds), they must (i) incorporate an unconditional obligation to_
pay at maturity an amount not lower than their nominal value or principal amount (“valore
_nominale”) and (ii) attribute to the holders no direct or indirect right to control or participate to_
the management of the Issuer.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest relating to Notes issued by the Issuer that
qualify as obbligazioni or titoli similari alle obbligazioni are subject to a tax, referred to as
_imposta sostitutiva (as defined below), levied at the rate of 26% (either when Interest is paid or_
when payment thereof is obtained by the holder on a sale of the Notes) where an Italian resident
holder of Notes is the beneficial owner of such Notes, and is:

(a) an individual holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial activity,
unless he has entrusted the management of his financial assets, including the Notes, to an
authorized intermediary and has opted for the application of the so-called risparmio gestito
regime (the “Asset Management Option”) pursuant to Article 7 of Italian Legislative Decree
No. 461 of November 21, 1997, as amended (“Decree No. 461”); or

(b) a partnership (other than a società in nome collettivo or società in accomandita semplice or
similar partnership) or a de facto partnership not carrying out mainly or exclusively
commercial activities or professional associations; or

(c) a private or public entity (other than a company) or a trust not carrying out commercial
activities; or

(d) an investor exempt from Italian corporate income taxation.

All the above categories are classed as “net recipients”.

Where the resident holders of the Notes described in (a) and (c) above are engaged in an
entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, imposta sostitutiva applies as a
provisional income tax and may be deducted from the taxation on income due.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian
resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security
entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any
income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on Interest if the Notes are included in a longterm individual savings account (piano individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the
requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and in Article
1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of 30 December 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented.

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the 26% imposta sostitutiva is applied by banks, società di
_intermediazione mobiliare (so-called “SIMs”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del_
_risparmio, stockbrokers and other qualified entities, identified by a decree of the Ministry of_
Finance, which are resident in Italy (“Intermediaries” and each an “Intermediary”) or by
permanent establishments in Italy of banks or intermediaries resident outside Italy or by
organizations or companies non-resident in Italy, acting through a system of centralized
administration of securities and directly connected with the Department of Revenue of the
Ministry of Finance (which includes Euroclear and Clearstream) having appointed an Italian
representative for the purposes of Decree No. 239. For the purposes of applying imposta
_sostitutiva, Intermediaries or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign intermediaries are_
required to act in connection with the collection of Interest or, in the transfer or disposal of
Notes, including in their capacity as Transferees.

Payments of Interest in respect of Notes issued by the Issuer that fall within the definitions set
out above are not subject to the 26% imposta sostitutiva if made to beneficial owners who are:

(a) Italian resident corporation or permanent establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to
which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) Italian resident partnerships carrying out commercial activities (società in nome collettivo or
_società in accomandita semplice);_

351


-----

(c) Italian resident open-ended or closed-ended collective investment funds, investment
companies with fixed capital (SICAFs) or investment companies with variable capital (SICAVs)
established in Italy, Italian resident pension funds referred to in Italian Legislative Decree
No. 252 of December 5, 2005 (“Decree No. 252”) and Italian resident real estate investment
funds; and

(d) Italian resident individuals holding Notes otherwise than in connection with entrepreneurial
activity who have entrusted the management of their financial assets, including the Notes, to
an authorized financial intermediary and have opted for the Asset Management Option.

Such categories are classed as “gross recipients”. To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the
Notes without the application of the 26% imposta sostitutiva, gross recipients must:

(a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes; and

(b) deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes in due time directly or
indirectly with an Italian authorized financial Intermediary (or permanent establishment in
Italy of foreign intermediary).

Where the Notes and the relevant coupons are not deposited with an authorized Intermediary
(or permanent establishment in Italy of foreign intermediary), imposta sostitutiva is applied and
withheld:

(a) by any Italian bank or any Italian intermediary paying Interest to the holders of the Notes, or

(b) by the Issuer, and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent
establishments in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected
are entitled to deduct any imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due.

Interest accrued on the Notes would be included in the corporate taxable income (and in certain
circumstances, depending on the “status” of the holders of the Notes, also in the net value of
production for purpose of regional tax on productive activities—IRAP) of the holders of the Notes
who are Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or permanent establishments
in Italy of foreign corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected, subject to tax in
Italy in accordance with ordinary tax rules.

Italian resident individuals holding Notes not in connection with entrepreneurial activity who
have opted for the Asset Management Option are subject to a 26% annual substitute tax (the
“Asset Management Tax”) on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of
each tax year (which increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). The Asset
Management Tax is applied on behalf of the taxpayer by the managing authorized intermediary.

Interest accrued on the Notes held by Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs and SICAFs is not
subject to the imposta sostitutiva, but is included in the aggregate income of the investment
funds, SICAVs and SICAFs. The Italian collective investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be
subject to taxation on such result, but a withholding tax of 26% will apply, in certain
circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders.

Where an Italian resident noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by
article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited
with an Italian resident intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the
holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of
the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% substitute tax
on the increase in value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year (which
increase would include Interest accrued on the Notes). Subject to certain conditions (including
minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income
relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the
Notes are included in a long term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth in Article 1 (100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and
in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and
supplemented.

352


-----

Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a real estate
SICAF to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as
subsequently amended and supplemented, apply, Interest accrued on the Notes will be subject
neither to imposta sostitutiva, nor to any other income tax in the hands of the real estate
investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will
apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of such real
estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of
the units or shares. Moreover, in certain circumstances, income realized by an Italian real estate
investment fund or real estate SICAF is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or
shareholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis.

_Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Pursuant to Decree No. 239, payments of Interest in respect of Notes will not be subject to
_imposta sostitutiva at the rate of 26%, provided that:_

(a) the payments are made to non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes with no
permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected;

(b) such beneficial owners are resident, for tax purposes, in White List States; and

(c) all the requirements and procedures set forth in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant
implementation rules, as subsequently amended and supplemented, in order to benefit from
the exemption from imposta sostitutiva, are met or complied with in due time.

The 26% imposta sostitutiva may generally be reduced to 10% or reduced to zero under certain
applicable double tax treaties entered into by Italy, if more favorable, subject to timely filing of
required documentation provided by the Measure of the Director of Italian Revenue Agency
No. 2013/84404 of July 10, 2013.

Decree No. 239 also provides for additional exemptions from imposta sostitutiva for payments of
Interest in respect of the Notes made to (i) international entities and organizations established in
accordance with international agreements ratified in Italy, (ii) “institutional investors”, whether
or not subject to tax, which are established in White List States and (iii) Central Banks or entities
which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

To ensure payment of Interest in respect of the Notes without the application of 26% imposta
_sostitutiva, non-Italian resident investors indicated above must:_

(a) be the beneficial owners of payments of Interest on the Notes, if the Holder is not an
institutional investor;

(b) deposit the Notes in due time together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or
indirectly with an Intermediary, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian bank
or financial intermediary, or with a non-Italian resident operator participating in a
centralized securities management system which is in contact via computer with the Ministry
of Economy and Finance; and

(c) file in due time with the relevant depository a declaration (autocertificazione) stating, inter
alia, that he or she is a resident, for tax purposes (or established, for institutional investors),
in a White List State. Such declaration (autocertificazione) which must comply with the
requirements set forth by an Italian Decree of the Ministry for the Economy and Finance of
December 12, 2001 (as amended and supplemented), is valid until withdrawn or revoked and
need not be submitted where a certificate, declaration or other similar document meant for
equivalent uses was previously submitted to the same depository. The declaration
(autocertificazione) is not required for non-Italian resident investors that are international
entities and organizations established in accordance with international agreements ratified
in Italy and Central Banks or entities which manage, inter alia, the official reserves of a
foreign state.

353


-----

Failure of a non-resident holder of the Notes to comply in due time with the procedures set forth
in Decree No. 239 and in the relevant implementation rules will result in the application of
_imposta sostitutiva on Interest payments to the non-resident holder of the Notes._

**_Payments made by an Italian resident guarantor_**

According to a certain interpretation, payments on the Notes made by an Italian resident
Guarantor under Notes Guarantees should be treated, in certain circumstances, as payment by
the relevant Issuer and should be subject to the tax regime described above. However, there is no
public guidelines issued by the Italian tax authorities dealing with the Italian tax regime of
payments on notes made by an Italian resident guarantor. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the Italian tax authorities will not assert an alternative treatment of such payments or that
the Italian courts would not support such an alternative treatment.

In particular, according to a different interpretation, if any future Italian resident guarantor
makes any payments in respect of Interest on the Notes (or any other amounts due under the
Notes other than the repayment of principal) it is possible that such payments may be subject to
withholding tax at the applicable rate of 26 percent pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 600 of
September 29, 1973, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty.

**_Fungible Issues_**

Pursuant to Article 11, paragraph 2 of Decree No. 239, where the relevant Issuer issues a new
Tranche forming part of a single series with a previous Tranche, for the purposes of calculating
the amount of Interest subject to imposta sostitutiva, the issue price of the new Tranche will be
deemed to be the same amount as the issue price of the original Tranche. This rule applies where
(a) the new Tranche is issued within twelve months from the issue date of the previous Tranche
and (b) the difference between the issue price of the new Tranche and that of the original
Tranche does not exceed 1% multiplied by the number of years of the duration of the Notes.

**_Capital Gains_**

_Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

Pursuant to Decree No. 461, a 26% capital gains tax (referred to as “imposta sostitutiva”) is
applicable to capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial
activities to which the Notes are connected, on any sale or transfer for consideration of the Notes
or redemption thereof.

Subject to certain limitations and requirements (including a minimum holding period), Italian
resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity or social security
entities pursuant to Legislative Decrees No. 509/1994 and No. 103/1996 may be exempt from any
income taxation, including the imposta sostitutiva, on interest, premium and other income
relating to the Notes if the Notes are included in a long-term individual savings account (piano
_individuale di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1_
(100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of
December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and supplemented. According to Article 1
(219-225) of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, under some conditions, capital losses realized by
Italian resident individuals not acting in connection with an entrepreneurial activity upon sale or
redemption of the Notes if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di
_risparmio a lungo termine) that meets specific requirements, give rise to a tax credit equal to the_
capital losses, provided that such tax credit does not exceed the 20% of the amount invested in
the long-term saving accounts (piano di risparmio a lungo termine).

Under the so-called “tax declaration regime”, which is the standard regime for taxation of
capital gains realized by Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities to
the extent that they do not opt for the “risparmio amministrato” regime or the Asset
Management Option, the 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains will be chargeable, on a

354


-----

cumulative basis, on all capital gains net of any relevant incurred capital losses realized by Italian
resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities pursuant to all investment
transactions carried out during any given tax year. The capital gains realized in a year net of any
relevant incurred capital losses must be detailed in the relevant annual tax return to be filed with
Italian tax authorities and imposta sostitutiva must be paid on such capital gains by Italian
resident individuals together with any balance income tax due for the relevant tax year.

Alternatively, holders of the Notes who are Italian resident individuals not engaged in
entrepreneurial activities to which the Notes are connected, may elect to pay imposta sostitutiva
separately on capital gains realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes
(“risparmio amministrato” regime). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to:

(a) the Notes being deposited with an Intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a
foreign intermediary); and

(b) an express election for the so called risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in
due time by the relevant holder of the Notes.

The Intermediary is responsible for accounting for imposta sostitutiva in respect of capital gains
realized on each sale or transfer or redemption of the Notes, as well as on capital gains realized
as at revocation of its mandate, net of any relevant incurred capital losses, and is required to pay
the relevant amount to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the holder of the Notes, deducting
a corresponding amount from proceeds to be credited to the holder of the Notes. Where a sale
or transfer or redemption of the Notes results in a capital loss, the intermediary is entitled to
deduct such loss from gains of the same kind subsequently realized on assets held by the holder
of the Notes within the same relationship of deposit in the same tax year or in the following tax
years up to the fourth. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any realized capital gain is not
required to be included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes.

Special rules apply if the Notes are part of (i) a portfolio managed under the Asset Management
Option by an Italian asset management company or an authorized intermediary or (ii) an Italian
_Organismo di Investimento Collettivo del Risparmio (which includes a Fondo Comune di_
_Investimento, SICAV or SICAF). In both cases, capital gains on the Notes will not be subject to_
26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains.

In particular, under the Asset Management Option, any appreciation of the Notes, even if not
realized, will contribute to determine the annual accrued appreciation of the managed portfolio,
subject to the Asset Management Tax. Any depreciation of the managed portfolio accrued at
year end may be carried forward against appreciation accrued in each of the four subsequent
years. Under the Asset Management Option the realized capital gain is not required to be
included in the annual income tax return of the holders of the Notes.

In the case of Notes held by investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs, capital gains on Notes contribute
to determine the increase in value of the managed assets of the funds, SICAVs or SICAFs accrued
at the end of each tax year. The investment funds, SICAVs or SICAFs will not be subject to
taxation on such increase, but a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain
circumstances, to distributions made in favor of unitholders or shareholders.

Any capital gains realized by a holder of the Notes that is an Italian pension fund (subject to the
regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will
not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the result of the relevant portfolio
accrued at the end of the tax period, to be subject to a 20% substitute tax on the increase in
value of the managed assets accrued at the end of each tax year. Subject to certain conditions
(including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other
income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if
the Notes are included in a long term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that
meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Law No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and
in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as subsequently amended and
supplemented.

355


-----

Where a holder of the Notes is an Italian resident real estate investment fund or a real estate
SICAF, to which the provisions of Italian Law Decree No. 351 of September 25, 2001, as
subsequently amended and supplemented, apply, capital gains realized will be subject neither to
_imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax in the hands of the real estate investment fund_
or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain
circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders of such real estate investment
funds or real estate SICAFs in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of units or shares.
Moreover, in certain circumstances, income realized by an Italian real estate investment fund or
real estate SICAF is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders
irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis.

Any capital gains realized by Italian resident corporations or similar commercial entities or
permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are
connected or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the
Notes are connected, will be included in their business income (and, in certain cases, may also be
included in the taxable net value of production for IRAP purposes), subject to tax in Italy
according to the relevant ordinary tax rules.

_Non-Italian Resident Holders of the Notes_

The 26% imposta sostitutiva on capital gains may in certain circumstances be payable on any
capital gains realized upon sale, transfer or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident
individuals and corporations without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are
effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy.

However any capital gains realized by non-Italian residents without a permanent establishment
in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected through the sale for consideration or
redemption of the Notes are exempt from taxation in Italy to the extent that the Notes are listed
on a regulated market (including a multilateral trading facility, which has been equated to a
“regulated market” for income tax purpose by the Italian tax authorities in paragraph 2 of the
circular letter no. 32 of December 23, 2020) in Italy or abroad, and in certain cases subject to
timely filing of required documentation (in the form of a declaration (autocertificazione) of
non-residence in Italy) with Italian qualified intermediaries (or permanent establishments in Italy
of foreign intermediaries) with which the Notes are deposited, even if the Notes are held in Italy
and regardless of the provisions set forth by any applicable double tax treaty.

Where the Notes are not listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading facility in Italy
or abroad:

(a) Pursuant to the provisions of Decree No. 461, non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the
Notes with no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected
are exempt from imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for
consideration or redemption of the Notes if they are resident for tax purposes in a White List
State. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident beneficial owners of the Notes
without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected
elect for the Asset Management Option or are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime,
exemption from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file with the
authorized financial intermediary an appropriate declaration (autocertificazione) stating
that they meet the requirement indicated above. The same exemption applies in case the
beneficial owners of the Notes are (i) international entities or organizations established in
accordance with international agreements ratified by Italy; (ii) certain foreign institutional
investors established in White List States; or (iii) Central Banks or entities which manage,
inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign State.

(b) In any event, non-Italian resident individuals or entities without a permanent establishment
in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected that may benefit from a double taxation
treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains realized upon sale or redemption of Notes are
to be taxed only in the country of tax residence of the recipient, will not be subject to

356


-----

_imposta sostitutiva in Italy on any capital gains realized upon sale for consideration or_
redemption of Notes. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian residents without a
permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected elect for the
Asset Management Option or are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime, exemption
from Italian capital gains tax will apply provided that they timely file with the authorized
financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a statement from the
competent tax authorities of the country of residence of the non-Italian residents.

The _risparmio_ _amministrato_ regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to
non-resident persons and entities in relation to Notes deposited for safekeeping or
administration with Italian banks, SIMs and other eligible entities, but non-resident holders of
the Notes retain the right to waive this regime.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**
Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 262 of October 3, 2006, converted into law with amendments
by Italian Law No. 286 of November 24, 2006, as amended and supplemented, the transfers of
any valuable assets (including the Notes) as a result of death or donation (or other transfers for
no consideration) and the creation of liens on such assets for a specific purpose are taxed as
follows:

(a) transfers in favor of spouses and direct descendants or direct ancestors are subject to an
inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 4% on the value of the inheritance or gift
exceeding €1,000,000 (per beneficiary);

(b) transfers in favor of brothers or sisters are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a
rate of 6% on the value of the inheritance or the gift exceeding €100,000 (per beneficiary);

(c) transfers in favor of relatives up to the fourth degree and relatives-in-law up to the third
degree are subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 6% on the entire value
of the inheritance or the gift; and

(d) any other transfer is subject to an inheritance and gift tax applied at a rate of 8% on the
entire value of the inheritance or the gift.

If the transfer is made in favor of persons with severe disabilities, the tax applies on the value
exceeding €1,500,000.

With respect to Notes listed on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading facility (as also
clarified by the answer published by the Italian tax authorities to the ruling no. 514 of
December 11, 2019), the value for inheritance and gift tax purposes is the average stock
exchange price of the last quarter preceding the date of the succession or of the gift (including
any accrued interest). With respect to unlisted Notes, the value for inheritance tax and gift tax
purposes is generally determined by reference to the value of listed debt securities having similar
features or based on certain elements as presented in the Italian tax law. Italian inheritance tax
and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by Italian resident
companies.

The transfer of financial instruments as a result of death is exempt from inheritance tax when
such financial instruments are included in a long-term saving account (piano individuale di
_risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth in Article 1(100-114) of Law_
No. 232 of December 11, 2016 and in Article 1 (210-215) of Law No. 145 of December 30, 2018, as
subsequently amended and supplemented.

Italian inheritance tax and gift tax applies to non-Italian resident individuals for bonds issued by
Italian resident companies.

**_Registration Tax_**
Contracts relating to the transfer of securities are subject to the registration tax as follows:
(i) public deeds and notarized deeds (atti pubblici e scritture private autenticate) executed in Italy

357


-----

are subject to fixed registration tax at a rate of €200; (ii) private deeds (scritture private non
_autenticate) are subject to registration tax at a rate of €200 only in the case of use or voluntary_
registration or occurrence of the so-called enunciazione.

**_Stamp Duty_**
According to Article 13 par. 2-ter of the tariff Part I attached to Italian Presidential Decree
No. 642 of October 26, 1972, as amended and supplemented, a proportional stamp duty applies
on a yearly basis to the periodic reporting communications sent by financial intermediaries to
their clients in respect of any financial product and instrument, which may be deposited with
such financial intermediary in Italy. This stamp duty applies at the rate of 0.20% on the market
value or—in the absence of a market value—on the nominal value or the redemption amount or
in the case the nominal or redemption values cannot be determined, on the purchase value of
any financial products and cannot exceed the amount of €14,000 for holders of the Notes that
are not individuals.

The statement is considered to be sent at least once a year, even for instruments for which is not
mandatory, nor the deposit, nor the release or the drafting of the statement. In case of reporting
periods of less than twelve months, the stamp duty is payable pro-rata.

Based on the wording of the law and the implementing decree issued by the Italian Ministry of
Economy on May 24, 2012, the stamp duty applies to any investor who is a client (as defined in
the regulations issued by the Bank of Italy on February 9, 2011) of an entity that exercises in any
form a banking, financial or insurance activity within the Italian territory.

**_Wealth Tax on Financial Assets Deposited Abroad_**
According to Article 19 of Decree No. 201/2011, as amended and supplemented, individuals,
non-profit entities and certain partnerships (società semplici or similar partnerships in accordance
with Article 5 of Decree No. 917) resident in Italy holding financial assets—including the Notes—
outside of the Italian territory are required to pay a wealth tax at the rate of 0.2%. The tax
applies on the market value at the end of the relevant year or—in the absence of a market
value—on the nominal value or redemption value, or in the case the face or redemption values
cannot be determined, on the purchase value of any financial assets held outside of the Italian
territory and cannot exceed the amount of €14,000 for holders of the Notes that are not
individuals. Taxpayers are generally entitled to an Italian tax credit equivalent to the amount of
wealth taxes paid in the State where the financial assets are held (up to an amount equal to the
Italian wealth tax due).

**_Tax Monitoring Obligations_**
Pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 167 of June 28,1990, converted by Italian Law No. 227 of
August 4, 1990, as amended and supplemented, individuals, non-profit entities and certain
partnerships (società semplici or similar partnerships in accordance with Article 5 of Decree
No. 917) resident in Italy who hold investments abroad or have financial activities abroad must,
in certain circumstances, disclose the aforesaid and related transactions to the Italian tax
authorities in their income tax return (or, in case the income tax return is not due, in a proper
form that must be filed within the same time as prescribed for the income tax return). The
requirement applies also where the persons above, being not the direct holder of the financial
instruments, are the actual owner of the instrument under the Italian money-laundering law.

Furthermore, the above reporting requirement is not required to comply with respect to Notes
deposited for management or administration with qualified Italian financial intermediaries, with
respect to contracts entered into through their intervention, upon condition that the items of
income derived from the Notes have been subject to tax by the same intermediaries and with
respect to foreign investments which are only composed by deposits and/or bank accounts when
their aggregate value never exceeds a €15,000 threshold throughout the year.

##### Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis
of all potential tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as
defined below) except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax
_Compliance Act”) and the discussion of a possible alternative tax treatment of the Notes (as_
discussed under “—Possible Alternative Tax Treatment of the Notes”). This discussion does not
address the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare contribution tax on net
investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax
laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is
based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position
would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, or to holders subject to
special rules, such as banks, thrifts and other financial institutions, holders of the Existing
Floating Rate Notes, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts,
brokers, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, S corporations, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or other pass through entities and investors in such entities, U.S.
holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the
United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “conversion
transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and
persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with
respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition,
this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their
“issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public
for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
(ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States persons”
(within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a United
States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds
the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an
investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the Notes.

359


-----

**This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Prospective purchasers**
**of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes**
**in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax**
**considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, non-U.S.**
**or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”, “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of Notes—Change_
_of Control”), the Issuer may be obligated to redeem the Notes for an amount different from their_
stated principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may be obligated to make certain
payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. The Issuer does not intend to
treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a
redemption occurring and such excess payments being made. Assuming the Issuer’s position is
respected, any such additional payments would generally be taken into account by a U.S. holder
at the time such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s usual
method of accounting for tax purposes.

The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper
manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s position is not, however,
binding on the IRS, and if the IRS successfully challenged this position, the tax consequences of
owning and disposing of the Notes could be materially different than those described herein,
including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized.
The balance of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment
debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential
application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences
thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible
in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are
received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such stated interest, but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so
received if such U.S. holder does not convert the foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of
receipt.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or
who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) may determine the amount
recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the
first method, such U.S. holder will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of foreign currency that has accrued with respect to its Notes during
an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency amount will be determined by
translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange
for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may instead elect,
however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange
on the last day of the interest accrual period and, with respect to the portion of an accrual

360


-----

period that spans two taxable years, that lands on the last day of a taxable year, at the spot rate
of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period
is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt of the interest.

The above election will apply to all debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not
be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or
loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of
foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the
U.S. dollar value of such interest payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on
the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of
the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above),
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such
exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign
tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest
income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**
The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes
exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily
defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the
number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. Holders of Notes generally will be required to
include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an
annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. Holders generally will include
any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of
the ‘‘daily portions’’ of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or
portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by
allocating to each day in any ‘‘accrual period’’ a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such
period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term
of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled
payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The
amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of
the Note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of such accrual period and its ‘‘yield to
maturity,’’ determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and
properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable
to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period
generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period.
The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present
value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount
equal to the issue price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue
price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest
rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as
of the issue date.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in
the third paragraph under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’

A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including,
upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID

361


-----

previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as
payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to
the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and
third, as receipt of principal. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or
loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing
instruments issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes are complex and prospective
purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes
as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain
or loss rules.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**
Stated interest income (and OID, if any) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income
and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit
allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid
by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign
tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to
applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). The calculation of foreign tax
credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or
deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**
Upon the sale, taxable exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note,
a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but
unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income (as discussed above) to the extent
not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S.
holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. Holder with respect to the Note. The
cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the
applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S.
holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special
election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such
Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S.
dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will
determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to
accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an
established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S.
holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that
does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the
settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or
loss.

362


-----

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income
or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss
generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date
principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect
to accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above
under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable. However,
upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to
accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by
such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss
attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be
capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in
respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a
foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**
In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the
accrual of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition
(including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is
an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup
withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise
fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Certain Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**
Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions
giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of
interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign
currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders
should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” (as
defined in Section 6038D of the Code) with an aggregate value in excess of certain minimum
thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information report
(IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a
required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of

363


-----

limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for
the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which
such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to
these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes
of these rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this
requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

##### Possible Alternative Tax Treatment of the Notes

Although not free from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position that payments of interest
on the Notes should be treated as from sources outside the United States for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Accordingly, a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. holder nor a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “non-U.S. holder”) should not be subject to
U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to the Notes. Because, however, a substantial portion
of the net proceeds of this offering is expected to be directly or indirectly on-lent by us to U.S.
BidCo and used in the United States to fund the Acquisition, the IRS may successfully assert that
there is a potential tax avoidance plan and that all or a portion of any payment of interest on the
Notes should be treated as from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In that case, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate
of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) with respect to interest payments on the Notes unless certain
certification requirements have been fulfilled (such as providing applicable IRS W-8 Forms). We
have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of
the Notes and there can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position
concerning the tax treatment described in this paragraph. We currently do not intend to
withhold on any payment made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders. However, in the
event that the interest income were treated as from sources within the United States for U.S.
federal income tax purpose, we or the applicable withholding agent may withhold on payments
made with respect to the Notes to non-U.S. holders unless the certification requirements
described above are met, and we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect
to amounts so withheld.

In that connection, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes, by its purchase and
acceptance of the Notes, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(i) if such holder or beneficial owner is not a United States person as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, (i) such holder or beneficial owner qualifies for an
exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax with respect to payments of interest pursuant
to an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; or (ii)(x) such holder
or beneficial owner does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the Issuer’s
voting stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code; (y) such holder or
beneficial owner is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual
or constructive stock ownership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (z) such holder or
beneficial owner is not a bank;

(ii) such holder or beneficial owner (and any intermediary through which such holder or
beneficial owner holds the Notes) qualifies for an exemption from any taxes imposed under
the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (which shall, for this purpose, refer to any taxes
imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor
version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements
entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the
United States with respect to the foregoing);

(iii) such holder or beneficial owner is able to provide any required U.S. tax documentation to
certify to the foregoing representations or to such holder’s or beneficial owner’s status as a

364


-----

United States person as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request
by the Issuer or an applicable withholding agent; and

(iv) such holder or beneficial owner agrees to give to each person to whom such holder or
beneficial owner transfers the Notes notice of its requirement to meet the foregoing tax
representations and documentation requirements.

Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible U.S. federal income tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**
Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”)
and subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be
required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such
payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or
prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru
payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered (as described above) would apply to
foreign passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of
publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are
issued. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and
additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any
withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no
additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

##### Certain Danish Tax Considerations

The following is an overview description of general Danish tax rules applicable to individual
investors and corporate investors resident in Denmark, according to the Danish tax laws in force
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and is subject to any changes in law and the
interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The
following overview does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose of the Notes, and
does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors.
Investors are, under all circumstances, strongly advised to contact their own tax advisor to clarify
the individual consequences of their investment, holding and disposal of the Notes.

The overview does not cover investors to whom special tax rules apply, and, therefore, may not
be relevant, for example, for certain institutional investors, insurance companies, pension
companies, banks, stockbrokers and investors with tax liability on return on pension investments.
The overview does not cover taxation of individuals and companies who carry on a business of
purchasing and selling Notes. The overview only sets out the tax position of the direct owners of
the Notes and further assumes that the direct investors are the beneficial owners, as understood
in accordance with Danish tax law, of the Notes and any interest thereon. Sales are assumed to
be sales to a third party (i.e. sales to a non-affiliated party) and any redemption is assumed to be
on arm’s length terms and is assumed to be a cash redemption (i.e. not a conversion to shares, a
waiver of debt or similar). Furthermore, it is assumed that the holders of the Notes are not directly or indirectly with other holders of the Notes or due to agreed joint control with other
investors - affiliated with the Issuer and that the investment and holding of the Notes does not
constitute tax abuse as understood in accordance with Section 3 of the Danish Tax Assessment
Act (ligningsloven).

365


-----

**_Withholding Tax_**
When the Issuer is not a Danish tax resident person, Denmark does not levy withholding tax on
payments on Notes.

**_Individual Investors Resident in Denmark_**
Notes owned by individual investors who are resident in Denmark for Danish tax purposes may
fall within two categories depending on whether the interest rate and/or the principal is
adjusted according to certain reference assets.

For tax purposes a distinction is made between:

(a) Notes falling within Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act
(kursgevinstloven), which are Notes that are adjusted in accordance with price development
on securities, goods, indices, assets or other metrics, as long as the price development can be
subject to a financial contract, whether in the form of an adjustment of the principal or
other payments under the Notes and whether or not the Notes Certificates are fully or only
partially adjusted in accordance therewith; and

(b) other Notes, including Notes linked solely to the development in a foreign currency and
certain consumer price or net price indices.

It is unlikely that the Notes will fall under Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Danish Capital Gains
Tax Act (kursgevinstloven) since notes with fixed interest rates and notes with floating interest
rates based on EURIBOR and similar reference interest rates are not considered as financial
contracts for the purposes of Section 29, Subsection 3 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act
(kursgevinstloven). Hence. we assume that the Notes qualify as ordinary debt instruments for
Danish tax purposes covered by the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven).

_Interest_
Income taxable as interest is taxed as capital income in the income year in which it falls due for
payment. Capital income is taxed at a rate of up to 42% (in 2021).

_Capital Gains_
Gains and losses on Notes, including currency gains, are included in the calculation of capital
income. However, a de minimis threshold will apply to the effect that net gains and losses on
debt claims, debt in currency other than Danish kroner and certain units in certain types of
investment funds falling under Section 22 of the Danish Act on Capital Gains on Shares
(aktieavancebeskatningsloven) below DKK 2,000 per year will not be included in the taxable
income. Further, tax deductibility of losses realized on Notes which are traded on a regulated
market is subject to the Danish tax authorities having been notified of the acquisition of the
Notes as further outlined in Section 15 of the Danish Capital Gains Tax Act (kursgevinstloven).
Losses realized on Notes on which Denmark is prevented from taxing interest or gains pursuant
to a tax treaty will not be deductible.

The Notes are taxed upon realization (i.e. redemption or disposal). Gains and losses are calculated
in DKK as the difference between the acquisition sum and the value at realization.

Individuals may elect to apply a mark-to-market principle for all receivables (including Notes)
traded on a regulated market and/or currency exchange gains and losses on receivables and debt
(including Notes) denominated in currencies other than DKK. Once the mark-to-market principle
is elected, a change back to the realization principle requires approval from the Danish tax
authorities. Under the mark-to-market principle, a gain or a loss is calculated as the difference
between the value of the Note at the beginning and the end of the income year, beginning with
the difference between the acquisition sum of the Note and the value of the Note at the end of
the same income year. Upon realization of the Note, the taxable income of that income year
equals the difference between the value of the Note at the beginning of the income year and
the value of the Note at realization. If the Note has been acquired and realized in the same
income year, the taxable income equals the difference between the acquisition sum and the
value at realization.

366


-----

**_Pension Funds_**
Pension fund investors are Notes subject to taxation in accordance with the Danish Act on
Pension Yield (pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven), which means that the gains and losses arising
from the Notes are taxed according to the marl-to-market principle (see above) at a tax rate of
15.3%.

**_Corporate Investors Resident in Denmark_**

_Interest_
Income taxable as interest is taxed in the income year in which it accrues. The tax rate is 22%
(in 2021).

_Capital gains_
Gains and losses on Notes are included in the calculation of taxable income (subject to certain
rules limiting tax losses on financing expenses). The tax rate is 22%.

The Notes are taxed under the market-to-market principle entailing that a gain or a loss is
calculated as the difference between the value of the Notes at the beginning and the end of the
income year, beginning with the difference between the acquisition sum of the Notes and the
value of the Notes at the end of the same income year. Upon realization of the Notes, the
taxable income of that income year equals the difference between the value of the Notes at the
beginning of the income year and the value of the Note at realization. If the Notes have been
acquired and realized in the same income year, the taxable income equals the difference
between the acquisition sum and the value at realization.

**_Gift and Inheritance Tax_**
Transfer of the Notes by way of gift is subject to Danish gift tax for the beneficiary/transferee, if
either the transferor or the transferee is a resident of Denmark for tax purposes at the time of
the gift. Transfer of the Notes by way of inheritance is subject to Danish inheritance tax if the
deceased was a resident of Denmark for tax purposes at the time of the death.

Tax treaties may limit Denmark’s right to impose gift or inheritance tax on non-residents of
Denmark.

**_Non-Resident Holders_**

A holder of the Notes will generally not be subject to Danish taxation on capital gains or interest
payments if such holder of Notes (i) is not a tax resident in Denmark, (ii) is not affiliated with the
Issuer or a Guarantor (upon payment under the Notes), or, if affiliated with the Issuer or a
Guarantor, is a tax resident of an EU/EEA member state or state with whom Denmark has a
double tax treaty, and (iii) does not carry out business in Denmark via a permanent establishment
in Denmark to which the Notes are attributable.

The above only applies if the relevant Issuer or Guarantor, (upon payment under the Notes) is a
Danish tax resident or carries out business in Denmark via a permanent establishment to which
the Notes and/or the guarantee is attributable to.

**_Transfer Tax_**
The issuance of the Notes and transfers of the Notes are not subject to transfer tax or stamp duty
in Denmark.

**_Wealth Taxation_**
No wealth taxation is applicable in Denmark.

##### Other Tax Considerations

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a guarantor of the Notes makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible
that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as

367


-----

may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other
exemption which may apply.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT
MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED
TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT
IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

## CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes
by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of ERISA, individual retirement accounts
(“IRAs”) and other plans and arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or
employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA),
certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA), non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) or other plans that are not subject to the foregoing but may be subject
to other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations that are similar to such
provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets”, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA), (as further described below) of any such plan, account or
arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

##### General Fiduciary Matters

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or an entity whose underlying assets are considered to
include “plan assets”, as described above (a “Benefit Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of a Benefit Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such a Benefit Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a
Benefit Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Benefit Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary
should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the notes for such Plan,
including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law and the
need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or
regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to
determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each Benefit Plan, including IRAs and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers or
any of their respective affiliates, agents or employees (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will
act, as a fiduciary to any Benefit Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.
The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice
based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to
the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials
from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and
are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding
the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase
and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Benefit Plan purchaser on an arm’s
length basis.

##### Prohibited Transaction Issues

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Benefit Plans from engaging in
certain transactions involving “plan assets” of such Benefit Plans with persons or entities who are
“parties in interest”, within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the
transaction. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, any
of the Transaction Parties. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and

369


-----

liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Benefit Plan that engaged
in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. For example, the acquisition and/or holding of Notes by a Benefit Plan with
respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may
constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/
or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and
holding of Notes by a Benefit Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary
making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or
disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA
and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Benefit Plan and
non-fiduciary service providers to the Benefit Plan. In addition, the United States Department of
Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to provide
exemptive relief for direct and indirect prohibited transactions arising in connection with the
acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to
time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent
“qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting investments by insurance
company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting investments by bank collective
investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting investments by life insurance company general
accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the
fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of
any of these or any other exemption should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the
exemption and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and
we do not provide any, assurance that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be
available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that all of the
conditions of any such exemptions or any other exemptions will be satisfied.

Plans that are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction requirements of
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws that
include similar requirements. Any fiduciary of such Plans should determine the need for, and, if
necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such Similar Laws.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes (including any interest in a Note) should not be purchased or
held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are
entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code
and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) would not otherwise
constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
or any violation of applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it
be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the excise taxes, penalties
and liabilities that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited
transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering acquiring
the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the
suitability of an acquisition of the Notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular
circumstances, potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to
such investments and whether an exemption would be necessary and, if so, applicable to the
purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that
their purchase and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) do not violate the fiduciary
responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, or
any applicable Similar Laws. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any
Transaction Party or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment
meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any
particular Plan or that such investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

##### Representation

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, or any interest therein, each purchaser and subsequent
transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that (x) either (i) no portion of the
assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note constitutes assets of any
Plan; or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Note by such purchaser or transferee does not and
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable Similar Laws, and (y) none of the
Transaction Parties has acted, is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice
or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

## PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement among, inter alios, the
Issuer and the Initial Purchasers dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (the
“Purchase Agreement”), the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial
Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Notes. The Initial Purchasers are J.P. Morgan AG, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and UniCredit
Bank AG. Sales in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their
agreement to purchase Notes from us, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement
provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers
may change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers
may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors
will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers
may be required to make in respect thereof. None of the Issuer or the Guarantors will for a
period of 45 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of, except the Notes and the guarantees thereof, any debt securities issued or
guaranteed by the Guarantors or the Issuer and having a tenor of more than one year that are
substantially similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers under
the Purchase Agreement.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold
within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to
persons who are not U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used
in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are
restricted as described under “Important Information” and “Transfer Restrictions”. In the
Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that:

- it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to the Issuer;

- it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or
otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available
any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II;
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer

372


-----

would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation and, in Italy, Article 35,
paragraph 1, letter d) and Annex 3 of Regulation No. 20307 of February 15, 2018 issued by the
_Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB”) and Article 34-ter, paragraph 1,_
letter b) of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended, pursuant to Article 100,
paragraph 3, letter a), of Legislative Decree no. 58 of February 24, 1998.

Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or
will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes (i) in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes and (ii) in the UK will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of such securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of
the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation. In the Purchase Agreement, each
Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs
Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been or will be prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy, and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes
may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum
and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions”.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the
Issue Date, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes
(such settlement being herein referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days
will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify
an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for
the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as

373


-----

described under “Transfer restrictions”. The Issuer has applied to list the Notes on the Official List
of the LuxSE and to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. However, the
Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be accepted or maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, as
permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not, however, obligated to make a market
in the Notes and may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole
discretion without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the
limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market will develop for the Notes or that you will be able to sell any Notes at
a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. If an active trading market for the
Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If
the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on
prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and
financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active_
_trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited”._

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay
stamp duty, taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilization Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. The
Stabilization Manager may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and
may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilization Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making
transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These
activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or the existence of trading markets for, the Notes.

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transaction. These
transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of
the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later
than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of
allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or
otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions,
engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment
banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing
and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time
have provided in the past, provide currently and may provide in the future, commercial lending
and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the
Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of
business for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees,
commissions and expenses. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders or
agents under the Revolving Credit Facility and receive customary fees for their services in such
capacities and certain of Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold Existing Notes.
We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the Existing Floating
Rate Notes (as described under “Use of proceeds”) and, to the extent that the Initial Purchasers
or their respective affiliates hold the Existing Floating Rate Notes, they will receive a portion of
the proceeds of the offering. In addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates have committed to fund a senior secured bridge facility to provide financing for the

374


-----

Acquisition in the event the offering of the Notes is not consummated, and such entities will
receive customary fees in respect thereof.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their
respective affiliates (including the Notes). The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer
or its affiliates rountinely hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk
management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

## TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other
transfer of any of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees offered hereby.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees are subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below.
By purchasing Notes, you will be deemed to have made the following acknowledgements,
representations to and agreements with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that:

(i) the Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities
laws and are being offered for resale in transactions that do not require registration
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws; and

(ii) unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred
except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and in
each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs 5, 6
and 7 below.

(2) You acknowledge that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt
from registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and

Securities Act) of the Issuer, that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

Securities Act) and are purchasing Notes for your own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer, and you are aware that the Initial Purchasers are
selling the Notes to you in reliance on Rule 144A; or

(ii) you are not a “U.S. person” (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act)

you acknowledge that no representation or warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers or
any person representing the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such
materials. You represent that you are relying only on this Offering Memorandum in making
your investment decision with respect to the Notes. You agree that you have had access to
such financial and other information concerning the Group and the Notes as you have
deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase Notes, including an

the disposition of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts be at
all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell the Notes
pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under the U.S.

within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act;

seller’s property or the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within
the seller or account’s control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws
and any applicable local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a
global note, the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year
after the Issuer, or any affiliate of the Issuer, was the owner of such note or an interest in
such global note, and so may continue indefinitely.

(6) You also acknowledge that:

(i) the above restrictions on resale will apply from the closing date until the date that is

closing date of the issuance of any additional Notes and the last date that we or any
of our affiliates was the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes or 40 days
(in the case of Regulation S Notes) after the later of the closing date and when the
Notes or any predecessor of the Notes are first offered to persons other than
distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S (the
“Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction
Period ends;

(ii) if a holder of Notes proposes to resell or transfer Notes under clause (5)(iii) above
before the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to the

Indenture which must provide, among other things, that the purchaser is an qualified
institutional buyer that is acquiring the Notes not for distribution in violation of the
U.S. Securities Act;

(iii) the Issuer, the Registrar and the Trustee reserve the right to require in connection with

each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

If the Notes are issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
each Note shall also bear a legend in substantially the following form:

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS SUPPLIED SOLELY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THIS NOTE WAS ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (‘‘OID’’) WITHIN THE
MEANING OF SECTION 1273 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE

ISSUE DATE AND THE YIELD TO MATURITY RELATING TO THE NOTES BY CONTACTING THE

378


-----

(8) You acknowledge until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or

dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from
registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

(9) You acknowledge that the Trustee will not be required to accept for registration or transfer

accuracy of the above acknowledgments, representations and agreements. You agree that
if any of the acknowledgments, representations or agreements you are deemed to have

and the Initial Purchasers. If you are purchasing any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or
more investor accounts, you represent that you have sole investment discretion with respect
to each of those accounts and that you have full power to make the above
acknowledgments, representations and agreements on behalf of each account.

(11) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United

action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject
to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution”.

through 1474 of the Code (and any amended or successor version), any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into
pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, or any law or regulation implementing an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States
with respect to the foregoing);

(iii) you are able to provide any required U.S. tax documentation to certify to the
foregoing representations or to your status as a United States person as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code upon reasonable request by the Issuer or an applicable
withholding agent; and

requirement to meet the foregoing tax representations and documentation
requirements.

## SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

The Issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Italy. The Initial Guarantors of the Notes
are incorporated under the laws of Italy, Denmark and Spain. The U.S. Guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Indenture (including the Notes
Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement and
the Revolving Credit Facility are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The documents
relating to the Initial Collateral for the Notes will be governed by the Italian, Danish and Spanish
law. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and of the Initial Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Because substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and of the
Initial Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Initial
Guarantor or any such other non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the
payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court
predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible
in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Initial Guarantor will appoint an
agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York
courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or
under U.S. federal or state securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any
action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within other
jurisdictions (including Italy, Spain, and Denmark) upon those persons, the Issuer or any Initial
Guarantor of the Notes provided that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service
Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15,
1965 is complied with.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or any guarantor of the Notes,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has
assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is
described below for the countries in which each of the guarantor or the collateral is located, you
should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a
judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The Notes offered hereby are governed by New York law. However, the Issuer’s creation and
issuance of the Notes (i.e. its corporate resolutions) and the Initial Guarantors’ approval of
documentation that they are a party to, are governed by Italian, Danish and Spanish law.

##### Italy

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including
judgments obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or
state securities laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that
pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di
_diritto internazionale privato), among others, the following conditions are met:_

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in
accordance with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant
have not been violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the
event of the defendant party’s failure to appear before the court, the U.S. court declared such
default in accordance with U.S. law;

384


-----

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same matter
which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if a judgment rendered
by a U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement
is necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in Italy to
that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively
ascertains the fulfillment of all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based
solely on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought
before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also
certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to
apply the U.S. law provisions or grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if
their application violates Italian public policy and/or any mandatory provisions of Italian law.

##### Denmark

We have been advised by our Danish counsel that the United States and Denmark currently do
not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters (as opposed to arbitration awards). Consequently, a final judgment for
payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws enforceable in the
United States, would not be recognized or enforceable in Denmark. A final judgment properly
obtained in a U.S. court will therefore neither be recognized nor enforced by the Danish courts
without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated. In connection with any
such re-examination, the judgment will generally be accepted as material evidence, but the
parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents of the
relevant foreign law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead.
Further, certain remedies available under U.S. law may not be allowed in Danish courts as
contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other remedies, punitive damages.

##### Spain

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain and a significant portion of their assets
are located in Spain. As a result, any judgment based on civil liability obtained against the
companies incorporated in Spain rendered outside of Spain in a country which: (a) is not bound
by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters; and (b) is not party to an international treaty providing for the recognition
and enforcement of judgments between the countries where the judgements seeking for
enforcement in Spain were rendered, would not be directly recognized or enforceable in Spain in
accordance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act as amended (Ley
_1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuciamiento Civil) (the “Spanish Civil Procedure Act”) and subject to_
Law 29/2015, of July 30, 2015, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015,
_de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Law on International_
**Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”).**

Accordingly, provided that the United States and Spain are not party to any international treaty
providing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, a judgment rendered by any
U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not be directly
recognized or enforceable in Spain, in accordance with and subject to Article 523 of the Spanish
Civil Procedure Act and subject to the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters.

385


-----

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered should initiate the recognition proceedings
(exequatur) in Spain before the relevant Court of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or
Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil), as the case may be, pursuant to Article 52 of the
Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters. According to the Law on International
Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, recognition and enforcement in Spain of such U.S. judgment
could be obtained provided that the following conditions are met (which do not include, under
prevailing Spanish case law, a review by the Spanish Court of First Instance or Commercial Court,
as the case may be, of the merits of the foreign judgment):

- the U.S. foreign judgment is final and conclusive (firme);

- the U.S. foreign judgment does not contravene Spanish public policy (orden público) or
mandatory provisions;

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter since the
dispute is clearly connected to the United States and the choice of the court is not fraudulent;

- there is no material contradiction or incompatibility of the U.S. judgment with a judgment
rendered in Spain; and there is no pending proceeding between the same parties and in
relation to the same issues in Spain initiated prior to the U.S. proceeding;

- that there is not an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same
subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings
before the foreign court;

- the Spanish Guarantor is not subject to an insolvency proceeding in Spain and the foreign
judgment does not meet the requirements provided for in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act;

- there is no material contradiction or incompatibility with an earlier judgment rendered in any
other state provided that such judgment complies with the applicable conditions to be
enforceable in Spain;

- where rendering the U.S. foreign judgment, the courts rendering it must not have infringed an
exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for in Spanish law or have based their jurisdiction on
exorbitant grounds;

- the rights of defense of the defendant have been protected where rendering the foreign
judgment, including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient
time for the defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts; and

- the U.S. judgment was not rendered by default (i.e. without appearance or without the
possibility to appear for the defendant).

The Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters expressly prohibits that a foreign
judgment is reviewed as to its substance (revision del fondo) by the Spanish competent court.

According to Article 3.2 of the Law on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters, the
Spanish Government may deny cooperation with another state’s authority if there has been a
reiterated refusal to cooperate or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation is imposed by such
other state’s authority provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these
purposes.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by Spanish law (relating to communication of documents
and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in Spain or from
Spanish persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action.

Any judgment obtained against the companies incorporated in Spain in any country bound by
the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would
be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

386


-----

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the
amount due and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the
court costs and interest will be paid in euros.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain involves, inter alia, the following principal actions
and costs: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn
translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) payment of certain professional
fees required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed);
(c) the payment of certain court fees; (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be
directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador);
(e) original or authenticated copy of the judgment duly apostilled or legalized must be filed; (f) a
document evidencing the service of process in the event that the judgment was rendered in
default of appearance must be filed; and (g) evidence of the judgment being final and conclusive
(firme) and executory must be filed. Under Spanish law, the content and validity of foreign law
must be evidenced to the Spanish courts. In addition, in accordance with Article 1 of the Spanish
Civil Procedure Act, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the
parties and such rules will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the
relevant agreement or the Notes.

As an alternative to the exequatur proceedings, the parties might agree to bring the original
action to Spain, so that the dispute is settled by Spanish Courts. Pursuant to Article 54 of the
current Spanish Civil Procedure Act, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly agree to
the submittal to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the Spanish Civil
Procedure Act and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del Poder
_Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute); however,_
this article does not expressly cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for
conflicts between different Spanish courts.

If an original action is brought in Spain, the choice of law made by the parties may be rejected by
Spanish courts on grounds that it contravenes Spanish public policy (orden público) or
enforcement may not be granted in the event that Spanigh courts deem that a right has been
exercised in such a manner to constitute an abuse of right (abuso de derecho).

## CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS

The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes
Guarantees and the security interests being provided for the Notes and a summary of certain
insolvency law considerations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors
are incorporated or organized. The description below is a summary only, and proceedings
(bankruptcy, insolvency or similar events) could be initiated in such jurisdiction and in the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of any future guarantor or future security provider
of the Notes, and it does not purport to be complete or to discuss all the limitations or
considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or the Notes
Guarantees or security interests being provided for the Notes. The application of these various
laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction and law should apply
and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under
the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Prospective investors
should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations.

##### European Union

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the
European Union.

**_Regime Applicable to Insolvency Proceedings opened after June 26, 2017_**
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of May 20, 2015, on
insolvency proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence
after June 26, 2017 (subject to certain exceptions).

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**
Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other
than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (which according
to such Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation is “the place where the debtor conducts the
_administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”). The_
determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact
on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time but
is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a
company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of
the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if
the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month
period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the
presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be
rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than
the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the
relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s
actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests
is located in that other EU member state. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into
consideration when determining the centre of main interests of a debtor can include where
board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or
has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established
and where they recognize as being the centre of the company’s operations.

If the center of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is
located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state

388


-----

have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the
Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main
proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Insolvency Regulation.

If the center of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark),
under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other
than Denmark) have jurisdiction (subject to certain exceptions) to open secondary and territorial
insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment”
(within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory
of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed
in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation and, for avoidance of doubt, are not limited to
winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are
commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined
to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the threemonth period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings
opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are
situated in such other EU member state.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member
state in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial
insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has
an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member
state in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s
law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose
claim arises from the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the EU
member state where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority
which, under the law of the EU member state within the territory of which the establishment is
situated, has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. When main insolvency
proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency
proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the Lex
_fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the_
insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the
court opening main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions) and give the same
effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings or
territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there and subject to certain other
exceptions (for instance, rights in rem situated in another EU member state remain subject to the
original laws governing such rights). The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU
member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred
on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove
assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as
no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation
measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other
EU member state where the company has assets. The Insolvency Regulation has created a
treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group
coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate
the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the
Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency
of several members of a group of companies in one or more member states of the EU (other than
Denmark). Under Article 61 of the Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may
be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member
of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in

389


-----

relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the
coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may
affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

##### Italy

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the
applicable laws and by its bylaws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on
corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a
security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group
reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

_Corporate Benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security
interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security
interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not
defined in the applicable legislation, is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by
case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if
any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on
a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest
of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While
corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a
security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross
stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of
the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity
organized under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in
exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be
proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such
guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or
security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial
consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other
members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as
to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate
benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or
guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic
benefit to it.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including
granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company ultra vires and
potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the
shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil
liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act
in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate
purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of
corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or
persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an
advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the
security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if

390


-----

the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such
third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and downstream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial
activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1,
1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and
authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking
Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this
respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3,
of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a
company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not
qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled
companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies
which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject
to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of
companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

_Financial Assistance_
In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any
liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or
2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific
exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans,
security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its
own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian
company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or
subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would
also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or
granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally
liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

_Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code_
Pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a guarantee granted by a guarantor
incorporated under the laws of Italy is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the
guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly
identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to
a separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees
granted by a guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy must be supported by corporate
benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee
and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Italian guarantor. It has been held
that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Italian guarantor’s assets. If such
determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Italian guarantor, there is
the risk that the guarantee could be declared void.

_Limitations to the Notes Guarantees and Collateral_
In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on corporate benefit and financial
assistance, the maximum amount that any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (each
an “Italian Guarantor” and, jointly, the “Italian Guarantors”) may be required to pay in respect
of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and any other transaction documents
related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, an Italian Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect
to the Notes, or an Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes
Guarantee.

391


-----

In particular, as regards to each of the Italian Guarantors, given the above limitation in relation
to Italian financial assistance law and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided in the Indenture, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) the Notes Guarantee and security interests granted by each of the Italian Guarantors will
only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under the relevant Tranche of the Notes
and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any
intercompany loans (including (i) with respect to Flos, the Flos I/C Loan, and (ii) with respect
to B&B, the B&B I/C Loan advanced from time to time to the relevant Italian Guarantor (or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by
the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following 22 November 2018, and
outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Notes Guarantee, in each case
net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received
upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor; provided
further that no Italian Guarantor shall be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in
excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made
by such Italian Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee;

(b) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by Flos, also in accordance with article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the
Tranche B (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time,
by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount
of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as
defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the
Notes;

(b) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by B&B, also in accordance with Article
1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (i) 120% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (ii) the original principal amount of the
Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time,
by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount
of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (I) the original principal amount of the Tranche C (as
defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes to (II) the original principal amount of the
Notes;

(d) the aggregate amount of interest in respect of the Notes guaranteed and/or secured by an
Italian Guarantor will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a
principal amount of the Notes equal to the principal amount of the Notes guaranteed and/or
secured by the relevant Italian Guarantor at that time;

(e) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the
mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (i) maximum interest rates (including the
Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) capitalization of interests
(including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative
Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of any of the Italian Guarantors under
its Notes Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as
usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts
compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code
and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively;
and

392


-----

(f) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the
relevant Notes Guarantee and/or security interest by:

(i) Flos does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or
payment obligations under Tranche B (each as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under
the Notes;

(ii) B&B does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or
indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/or
payment obligations under Tranche C (as defined in the “Use of Proceeds”) under the
Notes.

The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at
identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition
debt” and/or refinancing indebtedness in relation to “acquisition debt” in respect of,
respectively, Flos and B&B and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian
financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is
untested in Italian courts and it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and
separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’
proceeds to be utilized to refinance the portion of the Existing Floating Rate Notes that has been
utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of,
respectively, Flos and B&B. Should the Notes Guarantees and/or the security interests granted by
Flos and/or B&B, respectively, be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any
provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the
Italian Civil Code, such Notes Guarantees and/or security interests could be declared null and void
and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Notes Guarantee would
result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and
2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the relevant Italian Guarantor, such
Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Notes Guarantee shall
not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than
the Parent, Flos and B&B) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the
relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in
order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the
above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

The maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider may be required
to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor
under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by
such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due
by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured
creditor pursuant to the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with respect to any
further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any
security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned
limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian
Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under
the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Existing Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any agreement regulating future pari passu
indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents relating
to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be
cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will
provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such
guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an
aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above.

393


-----

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed
amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of
the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the
holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Notes
Guarantees and security.

_Trust_

The Collateral will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity
as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of
November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly
created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of
the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the
holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to
the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the
exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the_
name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral
nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate
documents or public registries.

In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk
that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of
the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not
upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of
the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security
Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral
also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the
subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new
and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the
_rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take_
a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor
of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by
the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral.

Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative
(rappresentante comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the
Italian Civil Code may be validly appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the
Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a
court.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security
interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes)
which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically
identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public
registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or
“trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights
and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is
uncertain under Italian law.

_Certain additional Considerations in Relation to Notes Guarantees and Collateral_

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for
rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in
respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly
or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that
borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the

394


-----

same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a
_responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank_
senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind
of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness
compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an
injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Any payment made by the borrower
with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be
required to be returned to the borrower. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in
any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly
and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either
directly or indirectly.

As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized
above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies
to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the
intercompany loans that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions,
Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with
Italian subsidiaries (including Flos and B&B) under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly,
an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any
intercompany loan (including the Flos I/C Loan and/or the B&B I/C Loan) are subordinated to all
its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any
intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors
by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any
amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including Flos
and B&B), which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment
obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any
intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the
Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any
guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries (including Flos and B&B)
may be impaired or restricted.

However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Liquidity Decree according to which the
provisions summarized above are temporarily frozen and therefore loans granted by (i) a person
that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination
powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and
coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company
incorporated in Italy as a limited liability company (società a responsabilità limitata) during the
period between April 9, 2020 and December 31, 2020 are exempted from the application of the
so-called “equitable subordination” rule.

_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the
enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes
may be familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and
second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals
often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that
employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings,
guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could
be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors
under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the

395


-----

relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor
during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation
of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see
“—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws—Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)” below. If challenged
successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security
interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security
documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by a guarantor
incorporated under the laws of Italy apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes
other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against
the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights
in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures,
the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti _a_ _prestazioni_
_corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not_
perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision
of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e
_decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to_
counterclaim;

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations
for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary
obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a
matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or
that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law
may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di
_applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be_
deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific
criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular
agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede
such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder
which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso
_del diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or
instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such
interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil
Code;

396


-----

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is
illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions
thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the
basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of
the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the
Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest
for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for
the Italian Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing
financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or
unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the
proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and
creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of
security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant
pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the
bankruptcy court;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year
in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in
the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand
(precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the
extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the
relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such
assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing
an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined
accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring
that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary
who states the date of witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions
concerning advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is
prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct
(dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge
from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the
relevant pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by
the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy
proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of
the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose
entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares.

- In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business,
an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in

397


-----

which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it
disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria)
pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of
ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other
act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court
could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the
ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the
acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the
act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or
credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice
and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party
participated in the fraudulent design.

**_Certain Italian insolvency law considerations_**
The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as those of other
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the
insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the
enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in
equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not
include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry
out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws
application where public companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have been
substantially reviewed and significant amendments are expected in the near future. In particular,
the Italian Government approved on January 12, 2019 the Legislative Decree No. 14 of
January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017
contending the scheme of a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia,
insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal
framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (so called “Code of Business Crisis
**and Insolvency”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the**
Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38 — Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations
introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito)
due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii)a new definition of “state of crisis”;
(iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and
to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the same Insolvency Code;
(iv) the adoption of the definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new
set of rules concerning group restructurings; (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favor going-concern proceedings;
(vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency; (vii) jurisdiction of
specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors; (viii) amendments to certain
provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been
currently postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of
8 April 2020 (“Liquidity Decree”), converted into law on June 5, 2020 no. 40. Until that date,
insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16,
1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), as in force before. Therefore, the practical consequences of
its implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to
date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact
the provisions set forth therein.

398


-----

Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently
and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not
been tested to date in the Italian courts. In this respect, the most recent reforms that have been
implemented by the Italian Government on the main Italian bankruptcy legislation as defined
below are: (i) the reform approved on June 23, 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent
reforms applicable, inter alia, to Italian bankruptcy law (the “Decree 83/2015”). The Decree
83/2015 entered into force in June 2015 and has been converted into law by Italian Law No. 132
of August 6, 2015, effective August 21, 2015 (“Law 132/2015”) and (ii) the amendments
implemented by means of the adoption of (a) the Law Decree No. 59 of May 3, 2016, converted
into law by Italian Law No. 119 of June 30, 2016, and (b) Italian Law No. 232 of December 11,
2016.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and
protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well
as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These
competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the
Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures
rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed
businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on
the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public
prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they
come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a
court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in
general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with
its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of
being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as
voidable transactions.

The following debt restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives are available under Italian law for
companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies. Restructuring outside of a judicial
_process (accordi stragiudiziali)_

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable
for the debtor and because informal out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an
out-of-court restructuring are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a
subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger
liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. However, in cases where a company is solvent,
but facing financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter into an out-of-court arrangement
with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.

_Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d)_
_of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_
Out-of-court debt restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani _di_
_risanamento attestati) prepared by companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to_
ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An independent expert appointed directly by the
debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business
data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert.
The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the
requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in
case of misrepresentation or false certification.

399


-----

Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or
approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising
authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and
consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do
not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary
actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail
and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security
interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions
(a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’
Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s
request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or
disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt
restructuring agreement.

_Debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_
The debtor may negotiate debt restructuring agreements with creditors holding at least 60% of
the total amount of claims or debts outstanding, subject to court’s approval (omologazione). An
independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and
accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and
that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following
terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court (omologazione), in
the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of
the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days
from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and
payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the
debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of
“financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can
initiate this process and request the court’s approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement entered into with its creditors.

The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its
publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors
cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor
in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in
relation to pre-existing debts. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any
indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore
provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third
party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements,
moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the abovementioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium
request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of
publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the
debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to
supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. Pending such
deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the agreement. At such
hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for
anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no interim relief
conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless

400


-----

agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days)
within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be
deposited.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time
frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without
prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the
agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register.
After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a
decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60%
of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning (omologazione) of
debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements
with respect to financial creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree
83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of
their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the
approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the
relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting
financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain
conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under
any other available alternative and that all creditors (adhering and non-adhering) have been
informed about the negotiations and have been allowed to take part in them in good faith. If
the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial
creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down
creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of
homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di
_moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that_
debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial
creditors, provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been
allowed to participate to such negotiations in good faith, and (ii)an independent expert meeting
the requirements provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
certifies that non-participating financial creditors have legal status and economic interests similar
to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium
arrangement. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring
operations involving more exposed bank and financial creditors, resulting in the failure of the
overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate
in the agreement may file an objection (opposizione) to it within 30 days of receipt of the
application.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided for under article 182-septies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors,
_inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the_
maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of
non-financial creditors (e.g., trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid
within 120 days if not participating to a scheme.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financings granted to the debtor
pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status
also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing).
Financings granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring
agreement or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted
such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such

401


-----

priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the concordato
_preventivo. The same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80% of their_
amount.

Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court,
pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article
182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium
application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court
supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors procedure described below) may authorize
the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior (prededucibile) indebtedness
and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims,
provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of
the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at
providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts
deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided
that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities
and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the
Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given
also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161,
Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt
restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors
(concordato preventivo) outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015,
pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article
182- bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium
application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence
of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the
court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called prededucibile)
indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the
financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of
such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

_Court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet
amount to insolvency) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to
make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its
overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency
and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a
commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding_
fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for
each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.
Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo
(together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing
the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting
data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the
debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the
court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement actions, precautionary measures and
interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the
_concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary_

402


-----

actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed.
Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and
mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the
concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such
pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the
restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any
case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of
composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità
_aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through_
extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated
companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial
instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the
debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and
(iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may
also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a
preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to
Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree
No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor
company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three
financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant
documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of
the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to
60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati _motivi)._
Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, provides
that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the
deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days, even if it has been filed an appeal for a
declaration of bankruptcy. The petition provides for the elements that make it necessary to grant
the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. The Court, acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the
extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds. In advance of
such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring
agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such
preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to
overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities
under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to
report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other
fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the
petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties
of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the
stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the
_concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called_
_concordato in bianco)._

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the
previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The
decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical
information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the
activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan)
that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established
by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position,
which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

403


-----

Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with
creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor
and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed
company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly
inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex
officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time
for the filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the
composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its
ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its
non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.

Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior
indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter
(e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the
company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law
132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are
exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.
Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans
granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with
creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being
filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato
_preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition._

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be
run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more
companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated
(concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo
should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the
continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support
which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the
continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater
extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concernbased arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets
that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari_
_giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the_
company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of
directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all
transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The debtor is allowed to carry out
urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary
transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim
acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to
Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the
favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote
and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of

404


-----

the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of
creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent
rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did
not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting
are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors
who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email)
within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term,
creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato
_preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato_
proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with
respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each
holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions
relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are
largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of
noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest—as could be the case of
disenfranchised noteholders – to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be
admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the
proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the
_concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value_
of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they
can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also
approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes
objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the
interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to
other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by
20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to
a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato
_preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater_
extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except
for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding
at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the
debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to
certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not
ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of
pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii)
30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals
based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets
forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato
_liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to_
the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must
ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation
of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the
court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor
does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to

405


-----

an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a
competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors.
After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised
by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a
confirmation order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon
request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate
conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt.

Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent
court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non
_compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of_
the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential
real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto
_immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili))._
The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for
the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after
admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be
suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such
circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the
damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid
prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree, the
deadlines for the fulfilment of concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring
agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be
extended by six months. In the procedures for the validation (omologazione) of concordato
_preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei_
_debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for_
the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a
_concordato in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt_
restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period
starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be
extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in
the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not
reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

_Bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)_
A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento)
for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in
certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under
Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations
with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy
court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori
_commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo_
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding_
fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess
of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things:

- subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file
claims within a defined period;

- under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as
soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the

406


-----

proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject
to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full
satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank
_pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the_
secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize
the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the
bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare);

- continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater
damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause
damage to creditors;

- any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after
(and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the
proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors;
and

- the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where
some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific
rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver,
a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a
representative of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor
to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance
with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time,
particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. In this respect, Law 132/2015
amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements
applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a
debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain
preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social
authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a
consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly
provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy
estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured
creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secured creditors, out of available funds
and assets (if any) as below indicated.

- Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can
terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The
relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting
from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file
such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two
years from the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the
extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not
receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being
assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of
their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into
classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts
and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured
claims are paid only in part. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the

407


-----

creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes
are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court
confirmation is also required.

- Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy
Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain
other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of
liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of
“predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs
related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of
secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law,
the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of
preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e.,
repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social
security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are,
in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in
payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori
_ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari)._
Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according
to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules
by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on
equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered
to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part
thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order:
(i) for payments of “predeductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding,
such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as
claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims.

- Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back”
or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of
payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration
of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value,
preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back
rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in
bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to
one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain
other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described
below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The
Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by
operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy
receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below.

- Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject
to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective
_vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the_
insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to
Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of
law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the
ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge
the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency
declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt
entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

408


-----

- Acts that may be avoided at the request of the bankruptcy receiver / court commissioner.

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below,
may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party
proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the
time the transaction was entered into:

i. onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration,
when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity
exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the
debtor;

ii. payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash
or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency
declaration;

iii. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which not yet due at
the time the new security was granted; and

iv. pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to
the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already
fallen due at the time the new security was granted.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the vulnerability period or such
other period specified below, may be avoided and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy
receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent
at the time of the act or transaction:

(i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous
transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency
declaration; and

(ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the
insolvency declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according
to market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and
permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank;

(iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of
the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a
residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the
purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property
that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that,
as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised
therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been
carried out therein;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees and security interests
granted by the debtor pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 67 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law;

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee and security interests
granted in the context of “concordato preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182_bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_

409


-----

(vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants
concerning work carried out by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date,
with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the
bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years
(revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian
Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its
assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered
into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently
entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and
that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third
person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on
which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The
burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in
place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its
creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant
assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant
(fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without
consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so
called fondo patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement
action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser.

Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace
the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings
within the European Union.

_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle_
_grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)._
The extraordinary administration procedure is available under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises; this procedure is commonly referred to as the “Prodi-bis procedure”. To
be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery
prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the year preceding the commencement of
the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial
statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial
year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the
public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing
contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding.
Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct
of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main
phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase.

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria
and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three
judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for
recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court
(within 30 days), and, within 10 days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic
Development (the “Ministry”) shall file an opinion on the admission of the company to the
extraordinary administration procedure. The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the
company to the procedure or place it into bankruptcy.

410


-----

If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative
phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a
restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern
within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization
leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by
the Ministry) (the “Recovery **Plan”).** It may also include a composition with creditors
(concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the
extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report
every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends
it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a
Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared bankrupt.

_Industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi_
_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_
Introduced in 2003 pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted
into Italian Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure is also known as the
“Marzano procedure”. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise
provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the
_Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the_
Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis,
have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least
€300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to
open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must
also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the
relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will
manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to
submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the
Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and
two years. If no Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare
the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_
A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for
public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit
institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to
bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the
private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that
the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant administrative authority
that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only
by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the
relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the
management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory
provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator
(commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are
monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the
designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed
by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced
administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and
includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory
administrative winding-up.

411


-----

_Interim financing_
The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also
obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade
receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a
court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the
entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority
status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the expert certification and
through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, among others, the relevant
debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access
such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the
request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial
commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with
priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with
Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall_
restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement,
provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

_Hardening period/clawback and fraudulent transfer_
In a bankruptcy proceeding, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to
one year (six-months in certain circumstances). In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy
receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the
Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria).

Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into
insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure
the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security
provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant
law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a
certain legally specified period (the “suspect _period”)._ The avoidance may relate to
(i) transactions made by the debtor within a suspect period of one year prior to the declaration
of the insolvency at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or
undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or
involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect
to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the
secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the
debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted within six
months prior to the declaration of insolvency with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable,
unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at
the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations,
transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured
obligations during the suspect period of six months prior to the declaration of the insolvency, if
the bankruptcy receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. The
transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s
Notes Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a
guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under
the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents
may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.
To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the
benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related
Security Documents.

It should be noted that: (i) under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain
limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the insolvent debtor for no consideration are

412


-----

ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the
insolvency declaration, and (ii) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of
receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective
_vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to insolvency._

In addition, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which
replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency
proceedings within the European Union.

##### Denmark

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_**

The Danish Companies Act (selskabsloven) contains restrictions on upstream guarantees and
security by Danish limited companies. Generally, Danish companies and their Danish and foreign
subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans to or issuing guarantees or providing security in
respect of obligations of, among others, their direct and indirect parent companies. However,
Danish companies may grant loans to or issue guarantees or provide security in respect of
obligations of parent companies covered by Danish Executive Order No. 85 of January 30, 2020
(on loans etc. to foreign parent companies) which includes any entity in the corporate form of
(i) a public limited company (aktieselskab), (ii) a limited partnership company (partnerselskab),
(iii) a private limited liability company (anpartsselskab) or (iv) a company with an equivalent
corporate form, incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European
Economic Area or Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or the U.S.

In addition, a Danish company is generally prohibited from granting loans, issuing guarantees or
providing security in connection with the financing or refinancing of the acquisition by any
person or entity of shares in such Danish company or shares in its direct and indirect parent
companies, and any such loan, guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable.

To the extent that any such debt constituting unlawful financial assistance cannot be separated
from other debt, such other debt may be deemed unlawful financial assistance debt and any
loans, guarantees or security granted by Danish companies for such other debt may then also be
invalid or unenforceable. According to the Danish Business Authority, the prohibition on
financial assistance also extends to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies. If loans,
guarantees or security are granted in violation of the prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees
or security will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid with statutory interests. The
directors may be subject to liability for losses suffered in this regard.

Further, it is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an
adequate corporate benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. The
management of the company is obliged to act in accordance with the company’s individual
interests, including, among other things, consideration of the company’s financial position, the
benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of guarantees and
security, assessment of the debtor and ensuring that the arrangement is on market terms. If such
benefit is not obtained, the directors of a Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to
civil liability and the guarantee or security may be deemed invalid. It is not clear under Danish
case law under which circumstances corporate benefit accrues to a subsidiary when such
subsidiary guarantees and secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company or other group
company. Accordingly, any guarantee or security provided by the Danish companies in
connection with the Notes will be limited (i) if and to the extent required to comply with Danish
statutory provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans,
including, without limitation, Sections 206 through 212 of the Danish Companies Act and (ii) to a
maximum amount equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of such Danish company
(calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) (a) at the time of the granting
of the guarantee or (b) at the time payment is requested pursuant to the guarantee. Hence, the
Notes will not have the benefit of guarantees from and security granted by a Danish Guarantor

413


-----

or security provider to the extent the proceeds of the Notes are deemed used towards financing
of the (direct or indirect) acquisition of such Danish Guarantor or security provider.

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may
become subject to set-off or counterclaim.

The Notes and the Security Agent will be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet) pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act, which will
allow the Security Agent to represent the holders of the Notes from time to time in connection
with any enforcement steps and legal proceedings in Denmark.

**_Certain Danish insolvency law considerations_**

One of the Guarantors and one of the security providers are companies incorporated under the
laws of Denmark. Any insolvency proceedings with respect to a Danish Guarantor or Danish
security provider would be based on Danish insolvency laws. Please note that the Insolvency
Regulation does not apply to Denmark.

Danish insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which the investors are familiar. In the event that a Danish
Guarantor or Danish security provider experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. In a Danish bankruptcy, the
debtor’s assets are liquidated and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors on a priority of
claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and
sale of going concern.

_Insolvency Proceedings_

Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor,
however provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Bankruptcy Act is
defined as the debtor’s inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is
considered to be temporary.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the
debtor operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt
of the petition for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive
information as to whether and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own
petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for
bankruptcy.

A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured
by adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to
provide full coverage for the creditor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of
perfection has not been performed, the creditor does not have adequate security.

The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g. a judgment in a civil
case, a settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim
does not have to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the
creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a
result, not all claims that have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for
bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a
repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being
rejected. The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will
reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that he will not receive any
dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that if there is probable cause to
believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may have the required
legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In that case,
the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of
certainty.

414


-----

A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if
the debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the
bankruptcy conditions, e.g. the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not
exist.

The petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate.
In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000. If the debtor
has filed the petition for bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the
bankruptcy estate.

_Bankruptcy Trustee_
One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in
practice the request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive
influence as another liquidator can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting.

The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is normally the case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Bankruptcy Act.
Consequently, the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor,
and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the
debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification
rules. The bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors
of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee.

The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate and he
represents the estate in every respect.

_Reconstruction_
Reconstruction proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor.
The petition for reconstruction must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which
the debtor operates his business.

Reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described
above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will
immediately appoint a reconstructor to administrate the company. A reconstructuring
accountant is appointed if requested by the company, the reconstructor or at least 25% of the
creditors. The management continues to operate the company, but any material transactions may
not be carried out without the prior approval of the reconstructor. Payment of creditors may only
be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below.

The reconstruction of a company must achieve the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue
of the company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of
the business of the company by transferring the business; or (3) a combination of a compulsory
composition and a transfer of business.

The reconstructor must try to achieve these objectives in no particular order. Within the four or
eight weeks (until a restructuring plan is adopted), the company can discontinue the
restructuring without automatically entering into insolvency proceedings. If the reconstructor
does not realize the statutory objectives after a restructuring plan is adopted, the company will
automatically enter bankruptcy proceedings as described above, unless it turns out that the
company is not (or no longer is) insolvent.

_Liquidation_
Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are
realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid
in full, the shareholders. In Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only
companies that are solvent can be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during
the liquidation process that the company cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must

415


-----

enter bankruptcy proceedings instead. The decision to liquidate a company is made by the
shareholders of the company at a general meeting who also appoint a liquidator. At the end of
the liquidation process the company will be dissolved.

_Foreign Currency_
Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, claims must be converted into DKK at the exchange rate at the
day the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order over the company.

_Challenges to the Guarantees and the Collateral_

Certain Avoidance Rules
Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to under certain
circumstances to avoid the debtor’s transactions in the period preceding the bankruptcy if such
transactions have reduced the assets of the estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the
transactions have favored certain creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors.

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts, renunciations of inheritance or the
payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties. Transactions favoring creditors without
observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment by unusual means of payment,
payments before due date, payments having deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay decisively or
the provision of security for prior debts. Set out herein is the avoidance rule on security for prior
debts and the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions.

Any security interest which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt
obligations which it secures or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of
such debt obligations will be subject to a three months hardening period, if insolvency
proceedings are commenced against the provider of the security during the three month period
starting from the latter of the date of the relevant act of perfection and the creation of the
security interest.

Danish law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that a disposition which
unduly favors a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s
property is prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the
company’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the
company was or because of the disposition became insolvent, and the favored party knew or
ought to have known about the company’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the
disposition improper. Generally, only transactions which are contrary to common norms of
correct and decent business behavior will be deemed improper. Improper behavior is normally
related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which typically is the situation
where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors
of their right to fulfilment of their claims.

The usual hardening period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to
24 months for transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general
avoidance rule (as described above) provides for an unlimited avoidance period with respect to
improper transactions.

Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims
Creditors who believe they have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove
their claims and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee
registers all claims and examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive
dividend.

The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Bankruptcy Act and it indicates the order in
which claims against the estate of the debtor are settled. All higher ranking claims must be
satisfied in full before the next level will be entitled to dividend. The ranking of creditors is as
follows:

- Firstly: claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims in according to affirmed
agreements;

- Secondly: claims in connection with any prior restructuring proceedings;

- Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable;

- Fourthly: claims of suppliers for indirect taxes;

- Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and

- Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinated loan capital).

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral_**
In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure
a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in
the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation
entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if
the primary obligation terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be
deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor or security provider is able to prove that
there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider
that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security
agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced
in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying
agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any
amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the
default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the
remedy of acceleration, a default must be considered material. The decision to accelerate an
agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party
as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or to
grant security interests over its assets to secure the Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not
constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a
guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or
secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and
economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified
under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings
from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees subject to
certain requirements.

Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee or under any
security instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would
constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the
obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantee or any security granted or
executed by such Spanish Guarantor:

(a) shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares
(acciones) representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares (acciones) or
quota shares (participaciones sociales) representing the share capital of its direct or indirect
parent company (sociedad dominante), or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the

417


-----

acquisition of shares (acciones) representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or
shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaciones sociales) representing the share capital of
its direct or indirect parent company (sociedad dominante); and

(b) shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent
that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article
150 and Article 143 of the Spanish Companies Act, as defined below, and, in that case, all
provisions of such Notes Guarantee or security shall be construed accordingly in the sense
that in no case can any Notes Guarantee or security given by the Spanish Guarantor provides
any such unlawful financial assistance.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades
_anónimas (S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares (acciones) or the shares_
(acciones) or quota shares (participaiones sociales) of any direct or indirect parent company
(sociedad _dominante),_ and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades _de_
_responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares (participaciones_
_socieales) and the shares (acciones) or quota shares (participaciones sociales) of any member of_
their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted
or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment
obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish
subsidiary or the shares (acciones) or quota shares (pariticipaciones sociales) of its direct or
indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such
security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150
and 143.2 of Spanish Legislative Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 approving the recast text of the
Spanish Companies Act, as amended (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010 de 2 de julio por el que se
_aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital) (the “Spanish Companies Act”)._
This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt. Accordingly, any guarantee
or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds
are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for
the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the
guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are
not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes.

For the purposes of the previous paragraph, a reference to a “parent company” of the Spanish
guarantor shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the
voting rights of such Spanish guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish
guarantor. It shall be presumed that a company has a dominant influence on another company
when:

- any of the scenarios set out in Section 1 of Article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código
_de Comercio) are met; or_

- when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish guarantor
are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant
company or of another company controlled by such dominant company.

In addition, a reference to the “group” of each Spanish guarantor shall mean the group of
companies that have in common the same parent company (as this term is described above).

In addition, Article 158 the Spanish Companies Act provides that the financial assistance
restrictions referred to above in relation to transactions targeting shares of a Spanish parent
company shall also be applicable to its non-Spanish subsidiaries carrying out such transactions.

In accordance with the above, the guarantees and security interests granted by Spanish
companies belonging to the same group, shall not guarantee those obligations or liabilities
which, if guaranteed, will constitute an infringement of Spanish financial assistance laws in
accordance with Articles 143.2 and/or 150 of the Spanish Companies Act.

Further, the structure of first demand guarantees is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil
Code but their validity and effectiveness have been reviewed in several judgments and defined

418


-----

by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) as autonomous, independent and abstract
guarantees, detached from the underlying agreement whose obligations are being guaranteed.
These judgments acknowledge the validity of provisions pursuant to which guarantors waive the
ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those arising from the guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with
certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad
faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) in the event that the beneficiary enforces the
guarantee in a fraudulent manner or in bad faith. Certain case law has also admitted that the
guarantor can stay enforcement by showing that there has been no event of default (the
guarantor bearing the burden of proof), usually through a motion for declaratory relief filed by
the guarantor.

Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into
account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee
causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below
half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its
share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance
between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its
insolvency.

In addition, and whilst this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that
certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit
the amount guaranteed under the Notes Guarantee by reference to the net equity (patrimonio
_neto) and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant_
security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral.

The law regulating the enforcement of pledges through auctions organized by notaries as
described in the Notary Public Law of May 28, 1862 (Ley del Notariado de 28 de mayo de 1862)
(the “Notarial Law”) was significantly amended by Law 15/2015 of July 2, 2015 on Voluntary
Jurisdiction (Ley 15/2015, de 2 de julio, de la Jurisdicción Voluntaria) (“Law 15/2015”). There is a
high degree of uncertainty on this new legal framework given that some provisions of the
Notarial Law seem to conflict with laws regarding the enforcement of pledges that were not
expressly repealed by Law 15/2015. As a result, certain aspects of these types of auctions are open
to interpretation. Amendments to the Notarial Law brought about by Law 15/2015 entered into
force on October 15, 2015 and there are no leading precedents as of the date hereof that clarify
how Law 15/2015 should be applied in practice. Consequently, the clauses in the pledge
agreements governing auctions organized by notaries may not be enforceable in accordance
with their own terms.

Under the Spanish Companies Act as amended (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por
_el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital), Spanish companies_
(both public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas (S.A.)) and private limited liability
companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)) may issue and guarantee (or provide
security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that recognize or create debt, with
certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad
_limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the_
Guarantee provided by Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of limited liability
companies (“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following
restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only issue notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own
equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a
public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution, (b) also, although there is no
consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law exists, S.L.s may also only
guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios),
unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint
guarantee from a credit institution, and (c) S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide
security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales).

419


-----

Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (5 years being the general term established
for obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may
be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any
combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the
relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these
obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms.
Enforcement before the courts will in any event, among others, be subject to:

- the nature of the remedies available; and

- the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived),
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho),
misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress,
abatement and counterclaim.

According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law
applicable in the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a
credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is
unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed
amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the
credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right being pledged,
etc.). If a judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish
security documents is governed by the Catalonian Civil Code, then this regulation would govern
those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could determine the challenge of
the validity of such pledges.

_Trust, Trustee and Security Agent under Spanish law_
Spanish law security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the Secured
Parties under the relevant security document and each secured party must accept said security
interest either entereing into the relevant security documents themselves or duly represented by
a Security Agent with sufficient faculties to represent the secured creditors for such purposes.

Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concepts of “trust”, “trustee” or “security agent”
and there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a
trustee or security agent (including the Security Agent), whether this would cause delays in the
enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the
relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security
Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a
Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an
enforcement situation. If Spanish-law security documents are entered into only by the security
agent and not also by the creditors on account of whom the security agent or trustee would be
acting, it can be argued that the security agent would be the only party entitled to enforce the
security interest in respect of those obligations, consequently, the security agent may only be
able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to
creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors
grant due and express powers of attorney in favor of the security agent duly notarized and
legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of
October 5, 1961) in order to represent them in the enforcement proceedings (nonetheless, this
may not be effective in the case of judicial enforcement proceedings, where one party cannot
represent another by virtue of a power of attorney).

The holders of the Notes, from time to time, shall be the beneficial holders of any Spanish law
security interests. However, given that they will not be parties to the Spanish law security
documents that will be executed by the Security Agent on their behalf, the holders of the Notes
may not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except
through the Security Agent (even if they are the direct beneficiaries of the security interests).

420


-----

Although it could be argued that Article 429 of the Spanish Companies Act (which allows the
representative of the syndicate of the holders of the Notes (comisario) to enforce any security
interest on behalf of all holders of the Notes under certain circumstances) could apply by
analogy, it cannot be disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest is carried out by
the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly
empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security
Agent by each of the Secured Parties duly notarized and, if not granted in Spain, with the
apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961 or legalized.

In the absence of the above-mentioned power of attorney, the Security Agent and/or Trustee,
acting as a security agent, may not be able to enforce the relevant Spanish security on behalf of
all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes). Furthermore, any beneficial
holders of a security who have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of
notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) a security agent to do so, may be treated as
unsecured creditors under Spanish law, including, without limitation, in an insolvency scenario.

In addition, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may
eventually be enforced may request the notarization of the documents from which the relevant
obligations arise and the notarization of each and every transfer certificate relating to each and
every transfer of the Notes.

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties
through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the
secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint
and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the
joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the
ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Notes
may be challenged.

_Parallel Debt_
The concept of “trust” and/or “parallel debt” (under, for example, the laws of the State of New
York or English law) is not recognized under Spanish law and, therefore, guarantees/security
interests require that the beneficiary of the guarantee/security interests and the creditor to be
the same person. Such guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does
not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the
parties that do. As mentioned above, if Spanish law security documents are entered into only by
the Security Agent (and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the
Security Agent will be the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in
respect of those obligations and it may only be able to do so in respect of the debt it individually
holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it is acting as security agent
unless such creditors grant the formal powers of attorney in its favor (duly notarized and
legalized or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5,
1961) in order for the Security Agent to represent them in any enforcement proceedings related
to Spanish law security documents.

Given that parallel debt structures have not yet been tested under Spanish law and we cannot
assure you that by creating any such structure it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability posed by such applicable law. If any challenge to the validity, perfection or
enforceability of the security interests created by the securities were successful, the holders of the
Notes may be unable to enforce the security.

Also, under Spanish law, in the event that the relevant obligor enters into insolvency
proceedings, the securities or the parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator, the obligor itself or by other creditors of such obligor
under the rules of avoidance or clawback of Spanish insolvency laws and the relevant law on the
non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions by the debtor.

**_Corporate benefit in cross-collateral security structures_**

A Spanish Guarantor will be creating the Spanish security as security of the Notes issued by a
company of the group receiving the financing under the Notes, so it can be argued whether such
Spanish Guarantor has obtained a corporate benefit for granting the relevant guarantee or
collateral over its assets.

Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of ‘‘corporate benefit’’ expressly regulated under
the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, however, Spanish lower courts,
particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters,
are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of
actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees or security interests in favor
of the liabilities incurred by a parent company and/or other companies of its group for the
purposes of article 226 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (i.e. rescission or claw-back of these
actions during the two year hardening period prior to the date of declaration of insolvency,
irrespective of the existence of fraudulent intent), when the obligations guaranteed or secured
does not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee or security
interest.

Some decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and
enforceability of such guarantees and security interests to the extent proof can be given that
amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or security interest or
indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company under a intercompany loan
agreement, equity contribution or similar arrangement, also taking into account any indirect
benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to
which such company belongs and the granting of parent guarantees, indemnities and comfort
letters for which the relevant company obtains most favorable economic and financial conditions
under its contractual relationships with suppliers and other counterparties, in accordance with
Spanish case law existing as for the construction of the concept of ‘‘compensatory advantage’’
(ventaja compensatoria).

However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits
and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency
administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency scenario where the claims
of the holders of the Notes, particularly as ‘‘special privilege claims’’ may be challenged if the
insolvency administrator or other creditors may allege that such corporate benefit did not exist.

**_Financial collateral_**

There is no consolidated case law on the application and interpretation of RDL 5/2005 with
regard to financial collateral and therefore it is not possible to predict the position a Spanish
court would take or the potential implications on the security interests of the Spanish Guarantor
declaring insolvency. In particular, as regards the scope ratione materiae of RDL 5/2005, the EU
Court of Justice judgment dated November 10, 2016 (Case 156/15), upholds a broad
interpretation of the terms “principal obligation” and “secured obligation” as used in Directive
2002/47, transposed into Spanish law under RDL 5/2005. Thus, the Court considers that these
terms must be considered to cover any obligation granting a right to cash settlement. In Spain, to
date, there has been no Supreme Court ruling in that regard. However, the Barcelona Court of
Appeal ruled in the same terms in its judgment of September 30, 2008.

**_Certain Spanish Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 of May 5, 2020, approving the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Act, as amended from time to time (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por
_el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal) (the “Spanish Recast Insolvency Act”),_
regulates pre-insolvency institutions and court insolvency proceedings. Prospective investors
should note that preceding Law 22/2003 regarding insolvency proceedings suffered various
reforms and amendments since it was first published in 2003. The Spanish Government has
approved in 2020 the latest recasting, in force as from September 1, 2020, in order not only to

422


-----

incorporate all these amendments but also to clarify and harmonize certain questions raised by
the courts and the doctrine since its first application by Spanish courts. However, it should be
noted that certain matters are still be subject to different views and different interpretations by
the relevant insolvency courts from time to time.

The entry into force of Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and
disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, implies that Spain will have two years as of such
date for the transposition of such Directive into the Spanish regulations. This transposition
process will probably lead to the approval of certain amendments to the Spanish Recast
Insolvency Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transposition process has not been initiated
yet and, therefore, it is still uncertain how this Directive will affect the Spanish Recast Insolvency
Act.

In addition, due to the health crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 14, 2020, the
Spanish Government declared a State of Alarm (Estado de Alarma) in Spain from March 14 to
June 21, 2020 and, since then, the Spanish Government has enacted certain Royal Decree Laws
that temporarily amend certain provisions of the Spanish insolvency regime, as further described
below. Moreover, future changes, amendments or restatements of the Spanish Recast Insolvency
Act cannot be disregarded either.

The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de
_acreedores”,_ applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically
contemplated in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to
reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the
debtor (the “Company Voluntary Agreement”, “CVA” or the “Composition Agreement”) or to
the liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

_Insolvency Filing_

A debtor (or, in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the bankruptcy petition
upon inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due (current insolvency or insolvencia
_actual). The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings_
when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due (imminent insolvency
or insolvencia inminente). Creditors also have standing to petition bankruptcy when the debtor is
unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due.

Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor
requests the bankruptcy, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a
petition for bankruptcy within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become
aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is
presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the
circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the
debtor fails to file a petition for bankruptcy within the time period established by law
(two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy
authority once the bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) the debtor
may be unable to exercise certain courses of action (including, inter alia, the possibility of
submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and (iii) the directors may be held liable for the
impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and
bankruptcy be classified as “guilty”.

Bankruptcy is considered mandatory or involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party.
Under article 2.4 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration
of insolvency if it can prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to
pay the amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the
court: (i) there is a previous judicial or administrative declaration of insolvency of the debtor,
provided that it is firm; (ii) there is a title for which a writ of execution or constraint has been

423


-----

issued without the seizure having resulted in known free assets sufficient for payment; (iii) a
seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (iv) a generalized
default on payments by the debtor; (v) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and
employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three months) or (vi) a
misplacement, “fire sale,” hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

Please note that, as a consequence of the of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Spanish government has enacted the Royal Decree Law 34/2020 of November 17, 2020, and the
Royal Decree Law 5/2021, of March 12, on extraordinary measures to support business solvency in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Real Decreto-ley 5/2021, de 12 de marzo, de medidas
_extraordinarias de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial en respuesta a la pandemia de la COVID-19)_
which have stayed the obligation to file for insolvency, currently until December 31, 2021 (please
note that despite their obligation having been stayed, the directors still have the right to file for
insolvency upon current or imminent insolvency and they could be held responsible for
worsening the insolvency situation during that period).

_Pre-Insolvency Filing_

Spanish law currently contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding, which is an insolvency
proceeding under both Spanish and European regulation. It protects the debtor, for a fourmonth period, from petitions for involuntary cases.

The general duty to file for bankruptcy within the previously discussed two-month period does
not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its
creditors to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged composition agreement (propuesta de
_convenio anticipado) a collective out of court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de_
_refinanciación) set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law ; or an out of_
court repayment agreement (acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) under articles 631 et seq. of the
Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (the “Creditors’ Negotiations Communication”). Effectively, by
means of the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication, in addition to those two months, the
debtor gains an additional three-month period as from the date when the debtor gives such
notice to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to (i) obtain accessions to a pre-arranged
CVA, (ii) achieve a refinancing agreement with its creditors or achieve an out of court repayment
agreement, and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency, unless it is no longer
insolvent. During this period of three months, creditors’ petitions for Mandatory Insolvency will
not be accepted. During the fourth month period: (i) the debtor has the duty to file for
insolvency, unless a pre-arranged CVA, a collective out of court workout or an out of court
repayment agreement is achieved (i.e. the company would gain four month grace period to file
for insolvency by a Creditors’ Negotiations Communication); and (ii) the mandatory petitions
could be filed but would not be accepted if the debtor has filed a voluntary insolvency petition
(i.e. voluntary case filings have priority over involuntary ones within the fourth month).

Likewise, the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged
CVA or a collective out of court workout (a refinancing agreement or acuerdo de refinanciación)
set out in articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, prevents the commencement
of court or out of court enforcement actions and/or suspends (as applicable) existing
enforcement actions, over assets or rights which are necessary for the company’s business
operations (other than those arising from public law claims) during a three-month period. In
addition, enforcement proceedings that are brought by creditors holding financial liabilities
(pasivos financieros), as defined in article 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, shall be
prohibited or suspended (as applicable), provided that it is evidenced that at least 51% of the
creditors holding financial liabilities (by value) have supported the initiation of negotiations to
enter into a refinancing agreement and have agreed to suspend or not initiate enforcement
proceedings against the debtor while creditors holding financial liabilities are still negotiating.
Nevertheless, secured creditors shall be entitled to bring enforcement proceedings against the
corresponding secured assets. However, if these secured assets are necessary for the continuity of
the debtor’s business or professional activity, once enforcement proceedings have been initiated,

424


-----

they shall be immediately suspended until three months have elapsed from the date when the
Creditor’s Negotiations Communication is filed. Financial securities subject to the RDL 5/2005 (as
defined below) and security interests over collateral located outside of Spain should not be
affected by the Creditors’ Negotiations Communication automatic stay.

_Request of coordinated insolvency_
The insolvency of a company that forms part of a group of companies, including the parent
company, does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the
group. As stated above, a company is insolvent when it cannot regularly meet its payment
obligations as they fall due. This analysis is conducted individually at each company level.

Notwithstanding the above, creditors may apply for a coordinated insolvency declaration of two
or more of its debtors (acumulación de concursos) if either: (a) the assets are commingled, or
(b) such debtors form part of the same group of companies.

Therefore, the request for the coordinated insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be
filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must
in fact be separately insolvent.

Coordinated insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they
form part of the same group.

As to ongoing insolvency proceedings, any of the insolvent debtors or the insolvency
administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural coordination under certain
circumstances (and, in particular, if the insolvent debtors form part of the same group of
companies). Moreover, creditors may apply for the procedural coordination of the insolvency
proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) the assets are
commingled, or (b) they pertain to the same group of companies, provided that a petition has
not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator pursuant
to Article 41 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law.

It is important to note that coordinated insolvency proceedings do not entail substantive
consolidation. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a
commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of
one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group
(except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a financial claim shall be subordinated).

The current system that the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law provides for is basically a procedural
which is aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost-efficient as possible.
However, exceptionally, for the purpose of drafting the insolvency report, by the insolvency
administrator only, assets and liabilities amongst the insolvent companies may be consolidated
where the estates and liabilities are so commingled, in order to avert unjustified cost and delay.

_Effects of Bankruptcy Declaration_

Effects for the Debtor
As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary case retains its management power, but is subject to
the intervention (intervención) of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal), who is
appointed by the court (intervention regime). In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general
rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by
the insolvency administrator, implying that the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and
management’s powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely upon the
insolvency administrators (suspension regime). However, the court has the power to modify this
general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency
administrator’s request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a
suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required
supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void unless ratified by the
insolvency administrators (administradores concursales).

Effects on Contracts

Bankruptcy declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending
performance by both parties by bankruptcy declaration (executory contracts), which remain in
full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the
insolvent estate. The court can nonetheless terminate (reject) any such contracts at the request of
the insolvency administrator (provided that management’s powers have been solely conferred
upon the insolvency administrator), the company itself (if its powers to manage and dispose of its
business are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrator) when such
termination is in the interest of the estate (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), or
terminate for breach at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such
contract. The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return
consideration received or indemnify its counterparty against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la
_masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent debtor at its_
request or the insolvency administrator’s request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en
_interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall have claim against the_
insolvency estate (pre-deductible claim from the estate).

Creditors will be able to accelerate, but not to terminate executory contracts based only on
bankruptcy declaration (declaración de concurso) of the debtor. Pursuant to Article 156 of the
Spanish Recast Insolvency Act, all clauses in contracts with mutual obligations that entitle any
party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency (ipso
_facto clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable,_
except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws).

Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for claims secured with an
in rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any
wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the
corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits
set-off.

_On enforcement proceedings_

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the court
declaration of insolvency (with the exception of certain actions conducted by public authorities
that do not concern assets necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional
activity of the debtor). Additionally, once the insolvency proceeding is declared open, singular,
judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated, nor may administrative or tax
demands for payment to be collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued.

The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights that are necessary for the
continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor may not be commenced
and the procedures already initiated before the declaration of insolvency shall be suspended for
one year since such declaration, unless an arrangement of a CVA is reached, provided that it does
not affect such right. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of
insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published.

(a) After such one-year moratorium without liquidation having started, a separated
enforcement could be instituted, so long as the secured creditor is not bound by a CVA
affecting its claim.

(b) Enforcement proceedings conducted before other courts or notary publics will be stayed
within this one-year period unless the insolvency court declares that the collateral is not
necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the debtor.

When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or
business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include

426


-----

most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent
debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing
the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be
an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant
security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about the
termination or amendment of the insolvent debtor’s contracts with such subsidiary allowing the
insolvent debtor to exploit such asset.

The above regime does not affect financial collateral foreseen under RDL 5/2005 (the Spanish law
implementing the EU Financial Collateral Directive), which shall be still enforceable, or where the
collateral is located in another EU member state by the time of insolvency declaration. If the
collateral is located in a non-EU state by the time of insolvency declaration, the automatic stay (if
any) and, in general, the effects of the insolvency will be governed by the insolvency law of the
state where the collateral is located.

Pursuant to Articles 44, 52 et seq. and 142 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law, in order
to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the jurisdiction of the court dealing with
insolvency proceedings is extended to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures
affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law).

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement
proceedings which can have an effect on the insolvent estate (excluding enforcement
proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in RDL 5/2005) or collateral located in
an EU state other the Spain or, subject to local law, a third state). When compatible, in order to
protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law extends the
jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to
handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether
based upon civil, labor, or administrative law).

Finally, prospective investors should also note that enforcement of any security interests will be
subject to the provisions of Spanish Procedural Law and Spanish Recast Insolvency Law (where
applicable), which may entail delays in the enforcement.

_Ranking of Credits_

The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to
them within a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State
Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims),
by providing original documentation that justifies their claims. Based on such documentation
provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency administrator draws up a list of
acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law,
which are as follows: (i) claims against the debtor’s estate; (ii) claims benefiting from special
privileges; (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iv) ordinary claims; and (v) subordinated
claims.

(1) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from Section 242 of the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Act sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims
from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are
generally payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before
other claims). Debt against the insolvency estate includes, among others, (a) certain amounts
of the employee payroll, (b) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (c) certain
amounts deriving from executory contracts and obligations to return and indemnify in cases
of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (d) those amounts that derive
from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed
by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it, if tied to
bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (e) certain amounts arising from obligations
created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of
insolvency and until its conclusion, (f) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the

427


-----

declaration of insolvency; (g) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor
under a Composition Agreements, (h) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Articles 598 or
606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act; excluding the new funds lent by persons being in a
special relationship with the debtor through a share capital increase, loan or analogous
transaction (however, please note that pursuant to Act 3/2020, of September 18, 2020, in the
event of the breach of a CVA approved or amended within the two years following the
declaration of State of Alarm – March 14, 2020 – loans, credit facilities or other analogous
agreements, or funds arising from persoal or in-rem guarantees held by specially related
persons shall be considered (under certain conditions) as estate claims);

(2) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially
_in rem security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over_
certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided
that such security is listed in the creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be
90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules
set out in articles 273 et seq. of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act minus senior claims). The
part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the
nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate
proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may
last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations
set forth in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act. However, within such waiting period or while
any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act,
the insolvency administrator has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency
estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to Composition
Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition
Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security
which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition
agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such
composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment
against the secured assets on which they are secured;

(3) Claims benefiting from general privileges include, among others, certain labor debts and
certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations
corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor
applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has
been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts.
New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the
requirements set forth in Articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act in the
amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) will
also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to be
affected by the restructuring (under a Composition Agreement) except if they give their
express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not
give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges
which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition
agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class
vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and,
in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by
law);

(4) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a pro-rated
basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of
estate claims and generally privileged claims; and

(5) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated
by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships
with the debtor. In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities

428


-----

controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal
entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same group of companies and the legal
entities in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual and legal
administrators. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially
related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are
natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as
described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or
more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed)—when the
shareholder is an individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also
specially related to the debtor; or (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and
those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those
people that have held these position during the two years prior to the insolvency
declaration); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their
common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding
requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly
or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a
refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in
Articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a
special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of
the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons
mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent
debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency
proceedings being declared open. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they do
not vote on the Composition Agreement and in the event of liquidation collect payment
according to the ranking established in the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act (once ordinary
creditors have been paid in full).

As an exception to the subordination regime, new financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a
refinancing agreement regulated under articles 598 or 606 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law,
which also contemplates a capitalization of credit rights before the granting of new financing,
shall not be classified as a subordinated claim under article 281 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency
Law, provided that the requirements set out in article 283 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law
are met. This is an incentive to promote refinancing and capitalization of credit rights.

Moreover, as a consequence of the of the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic, the Act 3/2020, of
September 18 (in force as of September 20, 2020) has enhanced the position of certain “specially
related parties” in order to solve situations of lack of liquidity. Accordingly, in insolvency
proceedings declared on or before March 14, 2022: (i) financing granted by specially related
parties; or (ii) financing in which they have been subrogated as creditors because of due payment
(e.g., as a result of the enforcement of a personal guarantee, resulting in a claim of the
guarantor vis-à-vis the debtor) would not be subordinated, but rather considered ordinary or
privileged credit claims.

_Hardening Periods_

There is no automatic claw-back by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency
administrator or receiver may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being
“detrimental” (perjudiciales) to the insolvent debtor’s estate, provided that they have taken
place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent
(transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the ordinary
regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code).

“Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the
transaction on the debtor’s interests. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a
non-rebuttable presumption, without admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of

429


-----

(i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso) and
(ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration (except
secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in the case of
(i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the
creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace
existing obligations and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling
due after the declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be
evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure
other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or
security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is
not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor
to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to
pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not
the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the
guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the
beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees.

If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction,
together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be
restored to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash
equal to the value of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that
the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify
the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the
judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the
debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the
insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts.

The exercise of rescission actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance
with law, which may be brought before the bankruptcy judge.

Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s
ordinary course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under
market conditions, (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of
payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments, and (iii) guarantees
constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of the labor authorities.

Neither “Refinancing Agreements,” nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any
guarantees instituted in the performance of such “Refinancing Agreements,” will be subject to
an action for rescission, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in
section ‘Protection of Certain Refinancing Agreements’.

_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_
Under Spanish law, in addition to the bankruptcy clawback action, the insolvency administrator
and any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria
_pauliana) against its debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement,_
provided the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain
payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is
broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring
such action:

- the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took
place after such debt was created;

- the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third
party;

430


-----

- such act was fraudulent;

- there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the
damages suffered; and

- debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential
requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of
the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no
consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable
by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment
(mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in
(i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the
presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable
presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor.
Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount
owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be
returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

_Protection of Certain Refinancing Agreements_

Certain refinancing agreements denominated “Collective Refinancing Agreements” may be
protected from claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain requirements further
explained in the section referred to as “—Cramdown _Effects_ _of_ _Certain_ _Refinancing_
_Agreements”._

In the case that such refinancing agreements are not subject to the procedure of judicial
sanctioning therein described (homologación), they may still have certain (but not total)
protection against clawback, if they are backed by at least 3/5 (60%) of the total claims of the
insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual and on a consolidated basis but excluding
intragroup claims). Among other requisites, the refinancing agreements must be founded on a
viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the short and medium term
and must comply with the rest of requirements explained below.

_Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements can be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy
proceeding, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing
agreements, if (i) they entail a significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt
structure by either granting a longer term or replacing previous claims with new ones with
longer maturity dates; (ii) they have been subscribed by creditors holding financial liabilities
representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial
supervision (that is to say the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor
creditors and those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required
thresholds are met) at the date of the refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a
certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds have been reached (in the case of a group
a companies, pursuant to certain precedents, the majority arguably refers both individually to
each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not taken into
account-), and when the company has no auditor, by the one appointed for this purpose; and
(iv) the agreement is formalized in a public instrument and the documents that validate its
content must be attached. Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the
bankruptcy claw-back action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent
conveyance law.

431


-----

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors
holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing
agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan,
or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not dissidents
can be extended effects beyond those provided by the law or object to homologation, and
whether they have standing to object to homologation, is controversial.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on
(i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial
creditors to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as
such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of
the Spanish Recast Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in respect of their secured
claims, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below:

(a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at
least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five
years or the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos
_participativos) of term up to five years._

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding
secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least
75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such
refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because
they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the
agreement; or, as default option, (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal
amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have
corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible
obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial
instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the
debt (datio pro solute or datio pro solvendo).

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding
secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

**_Conclusion of insolvency_**

_Settlement_
Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law
encourages creditors to reach a CVA regarding payment of the insolvency debts. The CVA may be
proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors, and it shall set forth how, when and up to
what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, the CVA must be honored by the debtor
and respected by the creditors.

The CVA must contain proposals for write offs and stays. Article 317 of Spanish Recast Insolvency
Law provides that it may also contain alternative or additional proposals for all creditors or for
certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of debt into shares,

432


-----

into profit participating loans, convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial
instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all
assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue
the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the CVA.

The proposals in the CVA shall include a payment schedule and a viability plan.

In order for a CVA to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met
at the creditors’ meeting:

(a) In case the CVA contains write offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims;
stays on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount, for a period
not exceeding five years; or, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public
administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans
(préstamos participativos) over the same period, at least 50% of the unsecured claims
(ordinary credits) have voted in favor of such CVA. Notwithstanding the above, a simple
majority will suffice when the CVA consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured
claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding
ordinary unsecured claims applying a write off of less than 20%.

(b) In case the CVA contains stays of between five and ten years; write offs of more than 50% of
the amount of the claims and, in the case of creditors other than those related to the public
administration or employment matters, the conversion of debt into profit participating loans
over the same period and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish Recast Insolvency
Law, 65% of the unsecured claims (ordinary credits) should have voted for the CVA.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the
debtor are not entitled to vote.

Although in principle privileged creditors are not subject to an approved CVA (unless they have
expressly voted in its favor) the effects of an approved CVA can be extended to privileged
creditors; provided that the relevant CVA has been approved by the following majorities of
creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial creditors
or others):

(a) In case the CVA contains a write off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the
amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than 5 years or conversion of debt into
profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than five years, at least 60% of
privileged creditors have voted in favor; and

(b) In case the CVA contains a write off of more than 50% of the claim; stays (for a period
between five and ten years), conversion of debt into profit participating loans also for a
period between five and ten years, and any other proposal permitted under the Spanish
Recast Insolvency Law, at least 75% of privileged creditors have voted in favor.Liquidation.

Failure to obtain the approval of a CVA or upon debtor’s petition at any time leads to
liquidation. The debtor must file a petition for liquidation if, after a CVA has been approved, it
becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations
undertaken after the approval of such CVA. In such a case, the company will be aimed at
dissolution and the directors (in the event of voluntary insolvency) will be removed. Deferred
credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash
credits.

The insolvency administrator will be required to submit a liquidation plan that must be approved
by the insolvency court. The insolvency administrator is required to report quarterly on the
liquidation and has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year,
the court may appoint a different insolvency administrator.

433


-----

_Termination of the insolvency proceedings_
Article 465.6º of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law also foresees the termination of the
insolvency proceeding at any stage when it is proven that all credits have been paid, or that all
creditors have been entirely satisfied by other means, or that the situation of insolvency (i.e. the
impossibility to face payment obligations regularly) has been overcome.

Finally, it must be noted that article 473 of the Spanish Recast Insolvency Law foresees the
termination of the insolvency proceeding at any time when assets are not enough to pay postinsolvency debt, as long as no future claw back actions are envisaged, nor actions claiming
liability to third parties, nor the assessment of the proceeding as guilty.

_Set-off_
Spanish Insolvency Act generally prohibits set-off of the credits and debts of the insolvent
company once it has been declared insolvent, but such set-off whose requirements in order to
operate were met before the declaration of insolvency can still apply. However, set-off may be
exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis the insolvent company if the governing law of the
reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under insolvency scenarios.

_Applicable Jurisdiction_
The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent
party has its “centre of main interests”. This “centre of main interests” is deemed to be where
the insolvent party conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may
be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the
“centre of main interests” are considered “the principal insolvency proceedings” and have
universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with certain exceptions,
such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “centre of main interests” is
not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will
only have jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 261 of the current Spanish Recast Insolvency
Act may apply, in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a
Spanish Guarantor may be classified as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized
until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is validly enforced. Nor will they have voting
rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand guarantee but an ordinary
guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden) and
division (división) apply.

_Temporary special insolvency provisions enacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic_
The effects and impact derived from the COVID-19 pandemic have led the Spanish Government
to enact a series of regulations that introduce or establish certain temporary measures in the
field of insolvency law aimed to preserve the Spanish business tissue and the creation of a stable
restructuring scenario. These regulations include, mainly, Royal Decree Law 8/2020, of March 17,
of urgent extraordinary measures to mitigate the economic and social impact of COVID-19 (Real
_Decreto-ley 8/2020, de 17 de marzo, de medidas urgentes extraordinarias para hacer frente al_
_impacto económico y social del COVID-19), Royal Decree Law 16/2020, of April 28, of procedural_
and organizational measures against COVID-19 in the field of the Department of Justice (Real
_Decreto-ley 16/2020, de 28 de abril, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al_
_COVID-19 en el ámbito de la Administración de Justicia), which was repealed by and its relevant_
provisions incorporated in Law 3/2020, of September 18, of procedural and organizational
measures against COVID-19 in the field of the Department of Justice (Ley 3/2020, de 18 de
_septiembre, de medidas procesales y organizativas para hacer frente al COVID-19 en el ámbito de_
_la Administración de Justicia), Royal Decree Law 34/2020, of November 17, of urgent measures to_
support corporate solvency and the energy sector, and on tax matters (Real Decreto-ley 34/2020,
_de 17 de noviembre, de medidas urgentes de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial y al sector_
_energético, y en materia tributaria) and Royal Decree Law 5/2021, of March 12, on extraordinary_
measures to support business solvency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Real Decreto-ley

434


-----

_5/2021, de 12 de marzo, de medidas extraordinarias de apoyo a la solvencia empresarial en_
_respuesta a la pandemia de la COVID-19) (altogether the “Spanish COVID-19 Regulations”)._
Among other measures related to debtors which have already filed for insolvency or subject to
opened insolvency proceedings or which have entered into composition agreements or
refinancing scheme agreements before the enactment of the Spanish COVID-19 Regulations, the
main measures related to insolvency law introduced by the Spanish COVID-19 Regulations
summarily include:

1. Insolvency moratorium: the Spanish COVID-19 Regulations entailed the introduction and
subsequent extensions of an exemption for directors in relation to their duty to file for
insolvency irrespective of whether they have notified the Court of the initiation of
negotiations for debt restructuring with creditors.

2. New money provided by specially related persons: the Spanish COVID-19 Regulations set
forth that as regards insolvency proceedings declared within two years of the declaration of
the state of alarm (estado de alarma) in Spain, i.e. March 14, 2020, new money provided by
specially related persons and any claims in which such specially related person is subrogated
after such date will have the consideration of ordinary claims, thus not subordinated.

3. Insolvency proceedings and liquidation plans: the Spanish COVID-19 Regulations introduced
different measures to accelerate insolvency proceedings. In relation to those insolvency
proceedings opened within two years of the declaration of the state of alarm (estado de
_alarma) in Spain, i.e. March 14, 2020, challenges against the list of creditors or assets_
(inventario) will need to be sustained on documentary or expert evidence (prueba pericial).
In relation to those insolvency proceedings already opened at the date of declaration of the
state of alarm (estado de alarma) or those opened in the following year, and subject to
certain exceptions, all auctions shall be out of court auctions (subastas extrajudiciales).
Finally, as a general measure, the approval of liquidation plans has been expedited.

#### Independent auditor’s report pursuant to ar�cle 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated 27 January 2010 (Transla�on from the original Italian text)

To the sole Shareholder of
Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A.

#### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

###### Opinion 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated statement of financial posi�on as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of
income, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
including a summary of significant accoun�ng policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial posi�on of the
Group as at 31 December 2020, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with Interna�onal Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union.

###### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia). Our responsibili�es
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements sec�on of our report._
We are independent of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. in accordance with the regula�ons and standards on
ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Responsibili�es of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for the prepara�on of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with International Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union, and,
within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
prepara�on of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern and, when preparing
the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assump�on, and for
appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern
basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. or to cease
opera�ons, or have no realis�c alterna�ve but to do so.

The statutory audit commi�ee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for
overseeing the Group’s financial repor�ng process.

###### Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Our objec�ves are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skep�cism throughout the audit. In addi�on:
we have iden�fied and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detec�ng a material misstatement resul�ng from fraud is higher than for one
resul�ng from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten�onal omissions, misrepresenta�ons, or
the override of internal control;
we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effec�veness of the Group’s internal control;
we have evaluated the appropriateness of accoun�ng policies used and the reasonableness of accoun�ng
es�mates and related disclosures made by the Directors;
we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accoun�ng
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
condi�ons that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw a�en�on in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this
ma�er in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or condi�ons may cause the Group to cease to con�nue
as a going concern;
we have evaluated the overall presenta�on, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transac�ons and events in a manner that achieves fair presenta�on;
we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial informa�on of the en��es
or business ac�vi�es within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direc�on, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, iden�fied at an appropriate level as required by ISA
Italia, regarding, among other ma�ers, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden�fy during our audit.

#### Report on compliance with other legal and regulatory requirements

###### Opinion pursuant to ar�cle 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39 dated 27 January 2010[1]

1 The Report on Operations of International Design Group as at 31 December 2020 is not
included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Directors of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. are responsible for the prepara�on of the Report on Opera�ons
of Interna�onal Design Group as at 31 December 2020, including its consistency with the related consolidated
financial statements and its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons.

We have performed the procedures required under audit standard SA Italia n. 720B, in order to express an opinion
on the consistency of the Report on Opera�ons, with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal
Design Group as at 31 December 2020 and on its compliance with the applicable laws and regula�ons, and in
order to assess whether it contains material misstatements.

In our opinion, the Report on Opera�ons is consistent with the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal
Design Group as at 31 December 2020 and comply with the applicable laws and regula�ons.

With reference to the statement required by art. 14, paragraph 2, subparagraph e), of Legisla�ve Decree n. 39,
dated 27 January 2010, based on our knowledge and understanding of the en�ty and its environment obtained
through our audit, we have no ma�ers to report.

**2** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union

F-16

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

The consolidated financial statements were prepared according to the historical cost convention,
except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and of other financial assets, which
are recognized at fair value. The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities subjected to fair
value hedging and that would otherwise by recognized at the amortized cost, is adjusted to take
into account variations in the fair value attributable to the hedged risks.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro and all values are expressed in
thousands of euro, unless otherwise directed.

**3** **BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of International Design
Group S.p.A. and of its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020.

Control is obtained when the Group is exposed or is entitled to variable returns, deriving from its
relations with the investee entity and, at the same time, can affect such returns by exercising its
power over that entity.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- power over the investee entity (i.e., it owns valid rights that currently entitle it to manage the
significant activities of the investee entity);

- exposure or rights to variable returns deriving from the relationships with the investee entity;

- the ability to exercise its own power on the investee entity to affect the amount of its returns.

When the Group holds less than the majority of the voting rights (or similar rights) it must
consider all relevant facts and circumstances to establish whether it controls the investee entity,
including:

- Contractual agreements with other holders of voting rights;

- Rights deriving from contractual agreements;

- Voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group.

The Group reconsiders whether or not it has control of an investee if the facts and circumstances
indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the three elements with relevance for the
purposes of the definition of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary starts when the Group
obtains control thereof and ceases when the Group loses control. The assets, liabilities, revenues
and costs of the subsidiary acquired or sold during the year are included in the statement of
comprehensive income from the date on which the Group obtains control until the date on
which the Group no longer exercises control of the company.

The profit/(loss) for the year and each of the other comprehensive income are attributed to the
shareholders of the parent company and to minority interests, even if this implies that minority
interests have a negative balance. When necessary, the appropriate adjustments are made to the
financial statements of the subsidiaries, to assure compliance with the group’s accounting
policies. All assets and liabilities, the shareholders’ equity, the revenues, costs and intercompany
cash flows relating to transactions between group entities are fully eliminated in the
consolidation phase.

Changes in the shareholdings in a subsidiary that do not entail a loss of control are recognized in
the shareholders’ equity.

If the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it must eliminate the related assets (including
goodwill), liabilities, minority interests and the other shareholders’ equity components, while any

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

**4** **SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**4.1** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CHANGES I N ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ERRORS**

Group revised the classification of expenses related to members of the board of directors not
employees including these expenses in the caption “personnel costs”. As a consequence, figures
as at December 31, 2019 has been reclassified reducing by Euro 1.371 thousand, services costs and
increasing for the same amount personnel costs.

**4.2** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL**

Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is
determined as the sum of the transferred price, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date,
and of the amount of the minority interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination,
the Group defines whether to measure the minority interest in the acquired entity at fair value
or proportionally to the minority interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. The
acquisition cost are expensed in the year and classified among administrative expenses.

The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and
assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the
ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the
ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce
with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly
contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or
cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing
outputs.

When the Group acquires a business, it classifies or designates the financial assets acquired or the
liabilities assumed in accordance with the contractual terms, the economic conditions and the
other pertinent conditions existing at the date of acquisition. This includes the check to
determine whether an embedded derivative has to be separated from the primary contract.

Any contingent consideration to be paid is recognized by the acquirer at fair value at the date of
acquisition. The contingent consideration classified as equity is not subject to remeasurement and
its subsequent payment is recognized with the shareholders’ equity. The change in the fair value
of the contingent consideration classified as asset or liability, as a financial instrument that is in
the subject of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, shall be recognised in the income statement in
accordance with IFRS 9. The contingent consideration that is not included in the scope of IFRS 9 is
measured at fair value at the date of the financial statements and fair value variations are
recognised in the income statement.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost represented by the excess of the aggregate consideration
consisting and the amount recorded for minority interests with respect to the identifiable net
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the fair value of the net assets
acquired exceeds the aggregate consideration, the Group verifies again whether it correctly
identified all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities and it reviews the procedures used to
determine the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results
in an excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired than the aggregate consideration, then
the difference (gain) is recognized in the income statement.

After the initial recognition, goodwill is measured at the cost net of accumulated impairment
losses. For the purpose of the impairment test, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is
allocated, from the date of acquisition, to each cash-generating unit of the Group expected to
benefit from the synergies of the aggregation, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of
the acquired entity are assigned to these units.

If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of some of the
operation within this unit, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the

F-19


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

carrying amount of the operation when the gain or the loss of the disposal is determined. The
goodwill associated with the disposed asset is determined on the basis of the relative values of
the disposed asset and of the retained part of the cash-generating unit.

**4.3** **CURRENT/NON-CURRENT CLASSIFICATION**

The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of the Group are classified according to the
current/non-current criterion.

An asset is current when:

- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle

- Held primarily for the purpose of trading

- Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period

Or

- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for
at least twelve months after the reporting period.

All other assets are classified either as non-current and current.

A liability is current when:

- it is expected to be extinguished in its normal operating cycle;

- it is held mainly for the purpose of trading;

- it must be extinguished within twelve months from the closing date of the year; or

- the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least
twelve months from the closing date of the year.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Assets and liabilities for deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified among non-current assets
and liabilities.

**4.4** **TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EXPRESSED IN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY FROM**
**THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY**

The rules for the translation of the financial statements of the subsidiaries expressed in currencies
other the Euro, are as follows:

- assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rates prevailing at the reference date of
the consolidated financial statements (December 31);

- costs and revenues are converted at the average exchange rate of the period;

- the translation reserve includes both the exchange differences generated by the conversion of
the amounts at a different rate from the closing rate and those generated by the translation of
the opening shareholders’ equity amounts at a different exchange rate from the one prevailing
on the closing date of the reporting period;

- upon disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI (translation reserve) relating to
that particular foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss;

- the goodwill and adjustments deriving from fair value related to the acquisition of a foreign
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange
rate prevailing on the closing date of the period.

**4.5** **FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT**

The Group measures certain financial assets at fair value at each reporting date.

The fair value is the price that would be collected for the sale of an asset, or that would be paid
for the transfer of a liability, in a regular transaction between market operators at the
measurement date.

A measurement of the fair value supposes that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability
takes place:

a) in the main market of the asset or liability; or

b) in the absence of a main market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The main market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group.

The fair value of an asset or liability is measured adopting the assumptions that market operators
would use in determining the price of the asset or liability, presuming that they act to best satisfy
their own economic interest.

A measurement of the fair value of a non-financial asset considers the capability of a market
operator to generate economic benefits employing the asset it its maximum and best use or
selling it to another market operator who would employ it in its maximum and best use.

The Group uses measurement techniques that are suitable for the circumstances and for which
there are sufficient available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of significant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of non-observable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which the fair value is assessed or exposed in the financial statements
are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy, as described below:

- Level 1—The (unadjusted) listed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which
the entity can access at the measurement date;

- Level 2—Inputs other than the listed prices included in Level 1, observable directly or indirectly
for the assets or for the liability;

- Level 3—Measurement techniques for which the input data are not observable for the asset or
for the liability.

The fair value measurement is entirely classified in the same level of the fair value hierarchy in
which the lowest input in the hierarchy used for the measurement is classified.

F-21


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

For the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group
determines whether there have been any transfers between the levels of the hierarchy revising
the categorization (based on the lowest level input, that is significant for the purposes of the fair
value measurement as a whole) at each reporting date.

For the purposes of the information about fair value, the Group determines the classes of assets
and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or of the liability
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as illustrated above.

**4.6** **REVENUE RECOGNITION**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods and services is
transferred to the customer for an amount that reflects the price the Group expects to receive in
exchange for such goods or services.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the price received or to be received, taking into account
the contractually defined payment terms and excluding taxes and duties. The Group concluded
that it is operating on its own behalf in all sales contracts inasmuch as it is the primary debtor, it
has discretionality on the price policy and it is also exposed to inventory and credit risk.

**4.6.1** **SALE OF GOODS**

The revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when the company has
transferred the control of the goods and services, generally on the date of delivery of the goods.

The revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received, net of
returns and rebates, commercial discounts and volume reductions. Subsidiaries provide a
two-year warranty on repair, in line with industry practice. Customers are not provided with
additional guarantees and maintenance contracts.

**4.6.2** **DIVIDENDS**

Dividends are recognized when the right to receive payment is established, which generally
corresponds to the time when the Shareholders’ Meeting approves their distribution.

**4.6.3** **RENTAL REVENUES**

Rents deriving from property investments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
duration of the existing lease contracts at the balance sheet date and are classified as revenues,
taking into account their operational nature.

**4.7** **INCOME TAXES**

**4.7.1** **CURRENT TAXES**

Current taxes of the year are measured for the amount expected to be recovered from or to be
paid to the tax authorities. The rates and the tax regulations used to calculate the amount are
those promulgated, or substantially in force, at the reporting date in the countries where the
Group operates and generates its own taxable income.

Current taxes relating to items recognized directly in the shareholders’ equity are also recognized
in the shareholders’ equity and not in the statement of the profit/(loss) for the period. The
Management periodically assesses the position assumed in the income tax return in the cases in
which the tax rules are subject to interpretation and, when appropriate, it allocates provisions.
Please refers to note 37 “Income taxes”

**4.7.2** **DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**

Deferred taxes are calculated applying the “liability method” to temporary differences at the
date of the financial statements between the tax values of the assets and liabilities and the
corresponding financial statement values.

F-22


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, with the following
exceptions:

- deferred tax liabilities derive from the initial recognition of the goodwill of an asset or liability
in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax
purposes;

- the reversal of taxable temporary differences, associated with equity investments in
subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, can be controlled, and it is probable that it will not
occur in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised in view of all deductible temporary differences, of receivables
and of unused tax losses that can be carried forward, to the extent to which it is probable that
sufficient future taxable income will be available, which will allow utilisation of deductible
temporary differences and of receivables and tax losses carried forward, excepting the cases in
which:

- the deferred tax asset connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the
financial statements nor the result for tax purposes;

- in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with equity investments in
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
to which it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that there will
be sufficient taxable income that allows to recover these temporary differences.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is re-examined at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent to which it is no longer probable that in the future there will be sufficient taxable
income to allow the receivable to be used in full or in part. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
re-examined at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent to which it becomes
probable that taxable income will be sufficient to allow these taxes to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax rate expected to be
applied during the year in which these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be
extinguished, considering the rates in force and the ones already promulgated, or substantially in
force, on the date of the financial statements.

Deferred taxes relating to elements recognised outside the income statement are also recognised
outside the income statement and, hence, in the shareholders’ equity or in the statement of
comprehensive income, consistently with the element to which they refer.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legal right that allows to
offset current tax receivables and current tax payables, and the deferred taxes refer to the same
taxpayer and to the same tax authority.

**4.7.3** **INDIRECT TAXES**

Expenses, revenues, assets and liabilities are recognised net of indirect taxes, such as the value
added tax, with the following exceptions:

- the tax applied to the purchase of goods or services is not deductible; in this case it is
recognised as a part of the purchase cost of the asset or part of the cost recognised in the
income statement;

- trade receivables and payables include the applicable indirect tax.

F-23


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

The net amount of the indirect taxes to be recovered or to be paid to the Tax Authorities is
included in the financial statements among receivables or among payables.

**4.8** **ASSETS HELD FOR DISPOSAL**

The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale/disposal if their carrying amount will be
recovered mainly with a sale transaction instead of through their continuous use. These
non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower between the carrying
amount and their fair value net of selling costs. Selling costs are additional costs directly
attributable to the sale, excluding financial costs and taxes.

The condition for classification as held for sale is considered to be met only when the sale is
highly probable and the asset for disposal is available for immediate sale in its current conditions.
The actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is improbable that there may be
significant changes in the sale or that the sale may be cancelled. The Management must be
committed to the sale, whose completion should be expected within one year from the date of
classification.

The assets and the liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately among the
current items in the financial statements.

An asset for disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is part of an entity that was
disposed or is classified as held for sale, and:

- it represents an important autonomous business unit or geographic business area,

- it is part of a single coordinated plan for the disposal of an important business unit or
geographic business area,

- it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively in view of a resale.

Additional information about the assets for disposal is provided in the Note “Assets held for
disposal”. All the other notes to the financial statement include amounts relating to operating
assets, unless otherwise indicated.

**4.9** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

Property, plant and machinery are measured at the cost of purchase or of production, net of the
accumulated depreciation and of any accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes ever
expense directly incurred to prepare the assets for their use, as well as any disposal and removal
expenses that will be incurred consequently to contractual obligations that required bringing the
asset back to the original conditions. Any interest expenses incurred for the acquisition,
production or construction of the property, plant and machinery are capitalised on the value of
the related asset until it is available for use.

The expenses incurred for ordinary and/or cyclical maintenance and repairs are charged directly
to the income statement in the year incurred. The capitalisation of costs inherent to the
expansion, modernization or improvement of the structural elements owned or used by third
parties is made solely to the extent that they meet the conditions for being classified separately
as an asset or part of an asset under the component approach method. Similarly, the replacement
costs of the identifiable components of complex assets are recognised among the assets and
amortised according to their estimated useful life; the residual carrying amount of the replaced
component is recognised in the income statement.

The annual depreciation rates, representative of the estimated useful life for categories of
tangible assets, are the follows:

**DEPRECIATION**

We point out that no changes have occurred in respect of the depreciation rates of previous year.
The useful life of the tangible assets and the residual value are revised and updated, when
applicable, at the closing of each year.

When the depreciable asset is composed of distinctly identifiable elements, the useful life of
which differs significantly from that of the other parts which compose the asset, depreciation is
taken separately for each of the parts which make up the asset under the “component
approach” principle.

The profits and losses deriving from sales or disposals of assets are determined as the difference
between the sale revenue and the net book value of the disposed or sold asset and are charged
to the income statement of the year of accrual.

Improvements to third-party assets are classified in tangible assets, consistently with the nature
of the cost incurred. The depreciation period corresponds to the lower between the residual
useful life of the tangible asset and the residual duration of the lease agreement.

Land is not depreciated.

**4.9.1** **LEASING**

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration.

_Group as a lessee_

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial

F-25


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any
lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

- Land and Buildings 2 to 24 years

- Plant and machinery 2 to 8 years

- Industrial and commercial equipment 2 to 5 years

- Other Assets 2 to 5 years

The item “Land and Buildings” mainly include the lease contracts for the showrooms directly
managed by B&B and Flos.

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful
life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section
Impairment of non-financial assets.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include
fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable,
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid
under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition
that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate
at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily
determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to
reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change
in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an
option to purchase the underlying asset.

The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see
Notes 11—23).

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of
machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option).

It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**4.10** **OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost, whereas those
acquired through business combinations are recognised at fair value at the date of purchase.

F-26


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

After the initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised at cost net of accumulated
amortisation and of any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets produced internally,
except for the development costs, are not capitalised and are recognised in the income statement
of the year in which they were incurred.

The useful life of intangible assets is assessed as finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised throughout their useful life and they are
subjected to impairment test every time there are indications of a possible impairment loss. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method of an intangible asset with definite useful life
is reconsidered at least at the end of each year. Changes in the expected useful life or in the ways
with which future economic benefits tied to the asset will be realised are recognised through the
change of the period or of the amortisation method, depending on the case, and they are
considered changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation rates of intangible assets with
definite useful life are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost
category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised, but are annually subjected to
impairment test, both at the individual level and at the level of cash generating unit. The
assessment of the indefinite useful life is revised annually to determine whether this attribution
continuous to be sustainable, otherwise, the change from indefinite useful life to defined useful
life is applied prospectively.

The gains or losses deriving from the elimination of an intangible asset are measured from the
difference between the net revenue of the disposal and the carrying amount of the intangible
asset and are recognised in the profit/(loss) of the year in the year when the derecognition takes
place.

**4.10.1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS**

Research costs are allocated in the income statement of the year in which they are incurred. The
development costs incurred in relation to a determined project are recognised as intangible
assets when the Group is able to demonstrate:

- the technical possibility of completing the intangible asset, so that it is available for use or sale;

- the intention to complete the asset and the Group’s ability to use it or sell it;

- the ways in which the asset will generate future economic benefits;

- the availability of resources to complete the asset;

- the ability to reliably asset the cost attributable to the asset during development;

- the ability to use the intangible asset generated.

After the initial recognition, development assets are measured at cost minus amortisation or
accumulated impairment losses. The amortisation of the asset starts when development is
completed and the asset is available for use. Development activities are amortised with reference
to the period of the expected benefits and the related amortisation rates are included in the cost
of goods sold.

During the development period the asset is subjected to annual impairment test.

**4.10.2 TRADEMARKS, LICENCES AND SIMILAR RIGHTS**

Amortisation of Licences is calculated with linear method so as to allocate the cost incurred for
the acquisition of the right along the shorter period from the expected utilisation period and the
duration of the related agreement starting from the time when the acquired right becomes
exercisable. Software licences are amortised with linear method on the period deemed
representative of the related useful life, i.e. 5 years.

**4.10.3 TRADEMARK**

The brands included in the consolidated balance sheet, present in the balance sheets of the
groups of which IDG gained control through the extraordinary transaction that took place in
2018, are represented mainly by the brands “FLOS”, “B&B”, Maxalto”, “Arclinea” and “Louis
Poulsen”.

Brands have been granted indefinite useful life (and, therefore, it is not subject to the
depreciation process), as:

- play a priority role in the Group’s strategy and are a primary value driver;

- the company structure, in its concept of organized material goods and organization itself in a
broad sense, is strongly related and dependent on the diffusion and development of brands on
the markets;

- Trademarks are owned and are correctly registered and constantly protected from a regulatory
point of view, with options for renewing legal protection when registration periods expire;

- the products marketed by the Group under these brands are not subject to particular
technological obsolescence, as is also characteristic for the “luxury” market in which the Group
operates, and indeed, are perceived by the market as constantly innovative and trendy, so as to
become models to imitate or to be inspired;

- the brand is characterized, in the national and/or international context, by a market
positioning and notoriety that ensures its pre-eminence in the respective market segments
being constantly associated and compared to the brands of absolute reference.

As of December 31, 2020, it was considered appropriate to subject the brand to a separate
impairment test in order to verify the consistency of the values entered in the budget, with the
criteria described below.

**4.11** **FINANCIAL ASSETS**

A financial instrument is any contract originating a financial asset for an entity and a financial
liability or an equity instrument for another entity.

i) Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are classified, according to the case, on the basis
of the subsequent measurement procedures, i.e. at amortised cost, at fair value recognised in
other comprehensive income OCI and at the fair value recognised in the income statement.

The classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition depends on the
characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the business model
used by the Group for their management. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a
significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical expedient, the
Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not

F-28


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

at fair value recognised in the income statement, the transaction costs. Trade receivables that do
not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical
expedient are measured at the price of the transaction determined according to IFRS 15. Please
refer to the paragraph of the accounting principles (e) Revenue from contracts with customers.

For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value in OCI, where
to generate cash flows that depend solely on the principal and interest on the amount of the
principal to be repaid (‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’). This assessment is
indicated as SPPI test and it is carried out at the instrument level.

The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets refers to the way in which it
manages its own financial assets to generate cash flows. The corporate model determines
whether the cash flows will derive from the collection of contractual cash flows, from the sale of
financial assets or from both.

The purchase or the sale of a financial asset that requires its delivery within a time interval
generally established by regulation or market convention (standardized or regular way trade) is
recognised at the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Group committed to purchase or sell the
asset.

Subsequpent measurement

For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four
categories:

- Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with
reclassification of earnings and accumulated losses (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without
reversal of earnings and accumulated losses at the time of elimination (equity instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement.

Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)

The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are
met:

- the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of
financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented
solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be
repaid.

Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest criterion
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when
the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued.

Financial assets at fair value recognised in the OCI (debt instruments)

The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:

- the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved
both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial
assets and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented
solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to
be repaid.

F-29


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

For assets from debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the interest income,
the changes due to exchange differences and the impairment losses, together with write-backs,
are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial
assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At
the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in
the income statement.

Assets from debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise the
investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets.

Investments in equity instruments

Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably opt to classify its own equity related
investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value recognised in OCI when they meet the
definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation”
and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument.

The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recognised in the income
statement. Dividends are recognised as other revenue in the income statement when the right to
payment was resolved, except when the Group benefits from this income as a recovery of part of
the cost of the financial asset, in which case these gains are recognised in OCI. Equity investments
recognised at fair value in OCI are not subjected to impairment testing.

The Group opted to classify its own unlisted equity investments in this category.

Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement.

This category comprises assets held for trading, assets designated upon first recognition as
financial assets at fair values with changes recognised in the income statement, or the financial
assets that must mandatorily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all assets
acquired for their sale or their repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including
non-embedded ones, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are
designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows not represented
solely by payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value recognised
in the income statement, regardless of the business model. In spite of the criteria for debt
instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at fair value recognised in OCI, as described
above, debt instruments can be recorded at fair value recognised in the income statement at the
time of initial recognition if this entail the derecognition or the significant reduction of an
accounting misalignment.

Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded
in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value recognised in the
statement of profit/(loss) for the year.

This category includes the derivative instruments and the listed equity investments the Group has
not chosen to classify at fair value recognised in OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are
also recognised as other income in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year when the right to
the payment has been established. The embedded derivative contained in a hybrid
non-derivative contract, in a financial liability or in a non-financial main contract, is separated
from the main contract and accounted for as a separate derivative, if: its economic characteristics
and the risks associated therewith are not closely related to those of the main contract; a
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would satisfy the definition
as a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value recognised in the income
statement. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in the income statement. A redetermination takes place only if there is a change in
the terms of the contract that significantly changes the cash flows otherwise expected or a
reclassification of a financial asset to a different category from fair value in the income
statement.

F-30


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

An embedded derivative included in a hybrid contract that contains a financial asset is not
separated from the host contract. The financial asset together with the embedded derivative is
classified internally as a financial asset at fair value recognised in the income statement.

Write-off

A financial asset (or, when applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is written off in the first place (e.g., removed from the statement of financial
position of the Group) when:

- the rights to receive the cash flows from the assets are extinguished, or

- the Group transferred to a third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or assumed
the contractual obligation to pay them in full and without delay and (a) transferred
substantially all risks and benefits of the ownership of the financial asset, or (b) did not
transfer or retained substantially all the risks and benefits of the asset, but it transferred
control thereof.

If the Group transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or executed an agreement
whereby it maintains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but it
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (passthrough), it assesses whether and to which extent it maintained the risks and the benefits
inherent to possession. If it did not transfer or retained substantially all risks and benefits or it
did not lose control thereon, the asset continues to be recognised in the financial statements of
the Group to the extent of its residual involvement in the asset. In this case, the Group also
recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liabilities are measured
so as to reflect the rights and the obligations that remain the Group’s.
When the residual involvement of the entity is a guarantee on the transferred asset, the
involvement is measured on the basis of the lesser between the amount of the asset and the
maximum amount of the consider received which the entity may have to repay.

Impairment of financial assets

Additional information about the impairment of financial losses is also provided in the note
“Discretionary assessments and significant accounting estimates”.

The Group records an impairment for expected losses (expected credit loss, ‘ECL’) for all financial
assets represented by debt instruments not held at fair value recognised in the income statement.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the
contract and all the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of
the original effective interest rate. The cash flows will include the cash flows deriving from the
enforcement of the collateral held or of other guarantees on the receivable which are integral
parts of the contractual conditions.

The expected losses are recognised in two steps. In relation to the credit exposures for which
there was not significant increase of the credit risk from the initial recognition, it is necessary to
recognise the losses on receivables that derive from the estimation of default events that are
possible within the subsequent 12 months (12-month ECL). For the credit exposures for which
there was a significant increase of the credit risk from initial recognition, it is necessary to fully
recognise the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure, regardless of
the time when the default event is forecast to occur (“Lifetime ECL”).

For trade receivables and assets deriving from contracts, the Group applies a simplified approach
in the calculation of the expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes to the
credit risk, but it fully recognises the expected loss at each reference date. The Group defined a
matrix system based on historical information, revised to consider prospective elements with
reference to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as an instrument for
determining the expected losses.

F-31

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

For assets represented by debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the Group
applies the simplified approach allowed for assets with low credit risk. At each reference date of
the financial statements, the Group assesses whether the debt instrument has a low credit risk
using all the available information that can be obtained without excessive costs or efforts. In
carrying out the assessment, the Group monitors the credit rating of the debt instrument.

The financial assets represented by debt instruments held by the Group measured at fair value
recognised in OCI comprise exclusively listed bonds classified in the best categories of credit
rating and, hence, they are considered investments with low credit risk. The Group’s policy is to
measure the expected losses in the subsequent 12 months on these instruments on an annual
basis. However, when a significant increase of the credit risk occurred, the Group fully recognises
the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the contractual payments have been
past due for 90 days. In some cases, the Group can also consider that a financial asset is in default
when internal or external information indicate that it is improbable that the Group will fully
recover the contractual amounts before considering the guarantees on the credit held by the
Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the
contractual cash flows.

**4.12** **FINANCIAL LIABILITIES**

_Recognition and initial measurement_

Financial liabilities are classified, at the time of the initial recognition, among financial liabilities
at fair value recognised in the income statement, among mortgages and loans, or among
derivatives designated as hedging instruments.

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value to which are added, in the cases of
mortgages, loans and payables, the transaction costs directly attributable thereto.

The financial liabilities of the Group comprise trade payables and other payables, mortgages and
loans, including current account overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

_Subsequent measurement_

The assessment of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described above:

Financial liabilities at fair value recognised in the income statement

Financial liabilities recognised at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement
comprise liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value with
changes recognised in the income statement.

Liabilities held for trading are all those assumed with the intention of extinguishing them or
transferring them in the short term. This category also includes the derivative financial
instruments entered into by the Group which are not designated as hedging instruments in a
hedging relationship defined by IFRS 9. Embedded derivatives, separated from the main contract,
are classified as financial instruments held for trading unless they are designated as effective
hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for
the year.

Financial liabilities are designated at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement
from the date of initial recognition, only if the criteria of IFRS 9 are met. At the time of the initial
recognition, the Group did not designate financial liabilities at fair value with changes
recognised in the income statement.

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

_Loans and receivables_

This category is the most significant for the Group. After the initial recognition, loans are
measured with the amortized cost criterion using the effective interest rate method. Gains and
losses are recognised in the income statement when the liability is extinguished, as well as
through the amortization process.

The amortized cost is calculated noting the discount or the bonus on the acquisition and the fees
or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective
interest rate is included among financial expenses in the statement of profit/(loss). This category
generally includes interest-bearing receivables and loans.

_Write-off_

A financial liability is written off when the obligation underlying the liability is extinguished,
voided or fulfilled. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another one of the same lender,
at substantially different conditions, or the conditions of an existing liability are substantially
amended, this exchange or amendment is treated as an accounting write-off the original liability,
accompanied by the recognition of a new liability, with recognition in the statement of profit/
(liability) of the year of any differences between the carrying amounts.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_

A financial asset and liability can be offset and the net balance exposed in the statement of
financial position, if there is a current legal right to offset the amounts recognised in the
financial accounts and there is the intention of extinguishing the net residue, or realising the
asset and concurrently extinguishing the liability.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting_

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as: forward foreign exchange contracts,
interest rate swaps and forward commodity acquisition contracts to cover respectively, its own
currency exchange rate risks, the interest rate risks and the commodity price risks. These
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date on which the
derivative contract is entered into and, subsequently, they are again measured at fair value.
Derivatives are recorded as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
liabilities when the fair value is negative.

For hedge accounting purposes, there are three types of hedges:

- fair value hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against changes of the fair value of the
asset or liability recognised or unrecorded irrevocable commitment;

- cash flow hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against the variability of the cash flows
attributable to a particular risk associated with all assets or liabilities recognised or to a highly
probable planned transaction or the foreign currency risk on unrecorded irrevocable
commitment;

- hedge of a net investment in a foreign management.

**4.13** **INVENTORIES**

Inventories are measured at the lower amount between the cost and the value of presumable net
realisation.

F-33


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

The costs incurred to bring each good to the current place and conditions are recognised as
follows:

- the cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost method, with the exception of
the LP Group that measures inventories with the FIFO criterion;

- the cost of production is determined including all costs directly attributable to the products,
general production costs, defined on the basis of the normal production capacity, excluding
the financial expenses.

The LP method does not generate significant differences with respect to the weighted average
cost method. For the part of inventory deemed no longer usable economically, or with an
assumed realisation value that is lower than the cost recognised in the financial statements, a
dedicated write-down provision is allocated.

**4.14** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**

At every reporting date, the Group assesses the existence of any indicators of asset impairment
losses. In this case, or in cases requiring an annual impairment test, the Group estimates the
recoverable value. The recoverable value is the higher amount between the fair value of the
asset or cash-generating unit, net of selling costs, and its value in use. The recoverable value is
determined by individual asset, except when the asset generates cash flows that are not broadly
independent of those generated by other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an
asset is greater than its recoverable value, the asset has undergone an impairment and it is
consequently written down to its recoverable value.

In calculating the value in use, the Group discounts estimated future cash flows to present value
using a discount rate before taxes, which reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. In calculating fair value net of selling costs, recent
transactions carried out on the market are taken into account. If these transactions cannot be
identified, an adequate valuation model is used. These calculations are supported by appropriate
valuation multipliers, prices of listed equities for investees whose securities are traded on the
market, and other available fair value indicators.

The Group bases its impairment test on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, prepared
separately for each cash-generating unit of the Group to which individual assets are allocated.
These budges and forecast calculations generally cover a period of seven years, of which five
characterized by an analytical plan development and the next two years by an analytical
construction provision based on a g-rate year by year.

This chose to aim to represent the entire actions carried out by the companies’ managements.

In case of longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated, which is used to project future
cash flows beyond the fifth year.

For acquisitions occurred in proximity to the end of the year, the group could determine the
recoverable value calculating the fair value of the asset to be evaluated.

Impairment losses of operating assets, including the impairment losses of inventories, are
recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost categories consistent with the
destination of the asset that underwent the impairment loss. Fixed assets previously revalued are
an exception, if the revaluation was recognised among the other comprehensive income. In these
cases, the impairment loss is in turn recognised among the other comprehensive income up to
the previous revaluation.

For assets other than goodwill, at each reporting date the Group assesses the existence of any
indications that the previously recognised impairment losses no longer apply (or were reduced)
and, if there are such indications, it estimates the recoverable value of the asset or of the CGU.

F-34


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

The value of an asset that was previously written down may be restored only if there were
changes in the assumptions on which the calculation of the determined recoverable value was
based, subsequent to the recognition of the last impairment loss. The write-back may not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, if
no impairment loss had been recognised in previous years. The write-back is recognised in the
statement of profit/(loss) for the year unless the asset is recognised at the written-back value, in
which case the write-back is treated as a revaluation increase.

The following criteria are used to account for impairment losses relating to specific types of
assets:

**4.14.1 GOODWILL**

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year (as of December 31) and, with greater
frequency, when the circumstances lead to believe that the book value could be subject to
impairment loss.

The impairment loss of the goodwill is determined measuring the recoverable value of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is connected. When the recoverable value of the cashgenerating unit was lower than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which
goodwill was allocated, an impairment loss is recognised. The write-down of the value of
goodwill may not be restored in future years.

**4.14.2 TRADEMARKS**

The other intangible assets with indefinite useful life, the trademarks (FLOS, B&B, Maxalto,
Arclinea and “Louis Poulsen” are subject to annual impairment test at the Cash Generating unit
level.

**4.15** **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS**

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits comprise cash at hand and short-term deposits
on demand with maturity within three months.

For the purposes of representing the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents are represented by cash as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

**4.16** **TREASURY SHARES**

Treasury shares bought back are recognised at cost and subtracted from shareholders’ equity. The
purchase, the sale or sale or write-off of treasury shares did not give rise to any profit or loss in
the income statement. The difference between the acquisition value and the consideration, in
case of re-emission, is recognised in the share premium reserve. If options on shares were
exercised in the period, they are satisfied with treasury shares.

**4.17** **PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES**

The Group recognises provisions for risks and charges when:

- it has a legal or implied obligation to third parties, resulting from a past event;

- it is probable that it will become necessary to use the Group’s resources to fulfil the obligation;

- a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be obtained.

Allocations are recognised at the present value, if the financial element (or time value) is
significantly appreciable, using a discount rate that reflects the specific risks of the liabilities.
When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the elapsing of time is
recognised as a financial expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in the income statement of
the period in which the change took place.

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

**4.18** **PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS**

The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan, which requires contributions to be made to
a separately administered fund.

Defined benefit pension plans, which also include the “TFR” (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto) due
in Italy to employees pursuant to Article 2120 of the Italian Civil Code, based on the working life
of the employees and on the remuneration received by the employee during a predetermined
service period. These benefits are unfunded. The cost of providing benefits under the defined
benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method, so are recognized in the
financial statement to discounting calculation

Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling,
excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on
plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are
recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or
credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur.

**4.19** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**

Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of sharebased payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments
(equity-settled transactions).

_Equity-settled transactions_

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant
is made using an appropriate valuation model.

That cost is recognized in employee benefits expense, together with a corresponding increase in
equity (other capital reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the
performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognized for
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to
which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end
of that period.

Service and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant
date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market
performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions
attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement is non-vesting conditions.
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate
expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions.

**5** **CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES**

**5.1.** **NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS**

The Group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any other
standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

**5.1.1** **AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 3: DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS**

The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an
integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive

F-36


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it
clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to
create outputs. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of
the Group but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations.

**5.1.2** **AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 7, IFRS 9 AND IAS 39 INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM**

The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by
interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to
uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item
or the hedging instrument. These amendments have no impact on the consolidated financial
statements of the Group as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.

**5.1.3** **AMENDMENTS TO IAS 1 AND IAS 8 DEFINITION OF MATERIAL**

The amendments provide a new definition of material that states, “information is material if
omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the
primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.” The
amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information,
either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial
statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to
influence decisions made by the primary users. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of, nor is there expected to be any future impact to the Group.

**5.1.4** **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FINANCIAL REPORTING ISSUED ON 29 MARCH 2018**

The Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and none of the concepts contained therein
override the concepts or requirements in any standard. The purpose of the Conceptual
Framework is to assist the IASB in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent
accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place and to assist all parties to
understand and interpret the standards. This will affect those entities which developed their
accounting policies based on the Conceptual Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework
includes some new concepts, updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities
and clarifies some important concepts. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated
financial statements of the Group.

**5.1.5** **AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 16 COVID-19 RELATED RENT CONCESSIONS**

On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions—amendment to IFRS 16
Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease
modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19
pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related
rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts
for any change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same
way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change was not a lease modification.
The amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. Earlier
application is permitted. This amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial
statements of the Group.

**6** **DISCRETIONARY VALUATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**

Preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires directors to make discretionary
valuations, estimates and hypotheses that influence the values of revenues, costs, assets and

F-37


-----

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

liabilities and the related disclosure, as well as the indication of potential liabilities. Uncertainty
about assumptions and estimates could lead to outcomes that will require, in the future, a
significant adjustment to the carrying amount of these assets and/or liabilities.

**6.1** **JUDGEMENTS**

In applying Group accounting standards, the directors made decisions based on the following
discretionary valuations (excluding those entailing estimates) with a significant effect on the
values recorded in the financial statements.

**6.2** **USE OF ESTIMATES**

Illustrated below are the assumptions pertaining to the future and the other main causes of
uncertainty in the estimates that, as at the end of the financial year, present the relevant risk of
giving rise to significant adjustments of the accounting values of the assets and liabilities within
the following year. The Group based its estimates and assumptions on parameters available at
the time of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. However, the current
circumstances and assumptions on future development could be modified because of changes in
the market or of events outside the Group’s control. If these changes take place, they will be
reflected in the assumptions.

**6.2.1** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**

An impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds
its recoverable value, which is the higher amount between the fair value net of selling costs and
its value in use. Fair value net of selling costs is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset
or of a cash-generating unit in a free transaction between informed and willing parties, minus
the costs of the disposal. The calculation of the value in use is based on a cash flow discounting
model. Cash flows are derived from the budget of the four subsequent years and do not include
restructuring activities for which the Group has not yet committed or significant future
investments that will increase the results of the assets comprising the cash-generating unit being
measured. The recoverable value depends markedly on the discount rate used in the cash flow
discounting model, as well as on cash flows expected in the future and on the growth-rate used
for extrapolation.

Given the uncertainties in place, it is important that entities provide detailed information on the
assumptions made, the evidence on which they are based and the impact of changing key
assumptions (sensitivity analysis). Given the level of intrinsic risk and the variability of judgments
and estimates, the disclosure on the key assumptions used and the assessments made to estimate
the recoverable value plays a fundamental role. The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be a
triggering event that requires an entity to carry out an impairment test in accordance with IAS
36. Entities will need to assess the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount
for the different CGUs. The key inputs used in the models with reference to the determination of
value in use and fair value less cost to sell will have to be reviewed to determine any impact.

Following the impairment test carried out, as per paragraph “Other Intangible asset” no
triggered event has been recognized for the group.

**6.2.2** **ALLOCATION FOR IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACTUAL ASSETS**

The Group uses a matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contractual assets. The
allocation rates are based on the days overdue for each class of customers grouped in the various
segments that have similar historical loss patterns (e.g., by geographic area, type of product, type
of customer, rating and guarantees).

The matrix is initially based on the observed historical insolvency rates of the Group. The Group
will calibrate the matrix to refine the historical data on credit losses with forecast elements.

F-38

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

**6.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA**

The Group’s main liabilities comprise trade receivables, loans and other payables. The main
objective of these liabilities is financing the operational activities of the Group. The Group has
trade and non-trade receivables, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term
deposits that originate directly from the operating activities.

The Group is exposed to market risk (interest and exchange rate risk), to credit risk and to
liquidity risk. Group management is tasked with managing these risks. The Board of Directors
shall review and approve the management policies of each of the risks exposed below.

**6.3.1** **INTEREST RATE RISK**

The interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial
instrument will be changed because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to
the risk of changes in market interest rates is related firstly to long-term debt with variable
interest rate. Consequently, the analysis of interest rate risk was carried out with a variation of +
100bps e -100 bps on Shareholder Loan and it may lead to a variation of 530 thousand of Euro.

**6.3.2** **EXCHANGE RATE RISK**

The exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of an exposure will
be changed because of changes in exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in
the exchange rates refer mainly to the operating activities of the Group (when the revenue or
costs are denominated in a foreign currency) and to the Group’s net investments in foreign
subsidiaries.

Although the Group has a strong international connotation, use of the Euro as a transnational
currency for most transactions almost eliminates the risk tied to exchange rate changes. The
Group is mainly exposed for positions denominated Euro, Danish Krone, Yen and US Dollar;
however, the volumes are not such as to have any significant impacts on the Group’s financial
and economic results. Consequently, no analysis was carried out on sensitivity to changes in
exchange rates.

**6.3.3** **CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations tied to a financial
instrument or to a commercial agreement, thus leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed
to the credit risk deriving from its operating activities (mostly for trade receivables and credit
notes) and including deposits with banks and financial institutions.

The credit risk correlated to commercial counterparties is managed by the individual subsidiaries
and monitored by the relative Group Administrative Offices. The Group has no significant credit
risk concentrations. However, procedures are in place to ensure that sales of products and
services are carried out to customers with high reliability, taking into account their financial
position, past experience and other factors. Credit limits on main customers are based on internal
and external valuations on the basis of thresholds approved by the head offices of the individual
countries. Use of credit limits is monitored periodically.

The currently existing customer list comprises the main market players, with maximum reliability
credit ratings. Therefore, no actions to hedge this risk were planned beyond the normal
procedures and checks used for credit risk management.

There are no receivables overdue for over 12 months.

**6.3.4** **FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND BANK DEPOSITS**

Concerning the credit risk relating to the management of financial resources and cash, the risk is
monitored by the Group Administrative Office, which implements procedures directed at
ensuring the Group companies have dealings with high, safe profile independent companies.

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

**6.3.5** **LIQUIDITY RISK**

The Group monitors the risk of a lack of liquidity using a liquidity planning tool.

The Group is not significantly exposed to this type of risk because the capital and financial
structure of the Group is sound.

**6.5** **CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, convertible
preference shares share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders
of the parent.

The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments due to changes in economic
conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is ‘net
debt’ divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio
between 40% and 50%. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and
borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and short-term deposits, excluding discontinued
operations.

The Management verified that the fair value of cash and cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, of trade receivables and payables, of bank overdrafts and of other current
liabilities approximates the book value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is reported in the amount for which the
instrument could be traded in a current transaction between willing parties, instead of in a
forced sale or in a liquidation. To estimate fair value, the following methods and the following
assumptions were used:

- Long-term receivables and loans, both fixed rate and floating rate, are measured by the Group
on the basis of parameters such as interest rates, specific risk factors for each Country, the
individual credit rating of each customer and the characteristic risk of the financial project.
Based on this measurement, the allocations for the expected losses on these receivables are
recognised in the accounting records.

- The fair value of listed securities and bonds is based on the listed price at the date of the
financial statements. The fair value of unlisted instruments, such as loans from banks or other
financial liabilities, obligations deriving from financial leases or as other non-current financial
liabilities, is estimated through discounted future cash flows applying the current rates
available for payables with similar terms, such as the credit risk and the remaining maturities.
In addition to being sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the expected cash flows or of
the discount rate, the fair value of equity instruments is also sensitive to reasonably possible
changes of the growth rates. The valuation requires the use, by the Management of
non-observable input data, illustrated previously. The Management regularly defines a range
of reasonably possible alternatives for these significant non observable input data and it
determines their impact on total fair value.

**6.6** **SEGMENT INFORMATION**

For management purposes, the Group is organized into business units based on the three CGU
(cash generating unit) identified for the evaluation of the fair value asset and liabilities.

The Executive Management Committee is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and
monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making
decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The Group’s financing
(including finance costs, finance income and other income) and income taxes are managed on a
Group basis through the cash pooling and fiscal consolidated and are not allocated to operating
segments.

In accordance with IAS 36, Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and it is tested for impairment
at least once a year.

F-45

International Design Group Consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2020

For impairment test purposes, Goodwill is allocated to the following Cash Generating Units,
CGUs: Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen.

The recoverable amount of each CGU (FLOS, B&B and Louis Poulsen) has been determined based
on the calculation of the value in use, in which the projections of the cash flows were those
approved by the management and of a period of 7 years, as approved by the management.

The calculation of the value in use is particularly sensitive to the following assumptions:

- revenue trend;

- marginality;

- discount rate;

- growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period.

COVID-19 pandemic spread constitutes an external factor of potential presumption of
impairment for all companies, therefore the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the three
CGUs has been verified, in light of a specific analysis of the impact of the crisis on the value of
fixed assets and on the basis of a business plan updated at the beginning of 2021.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA—European Securities and Market
Authority) draws attention to the need to represent the growing level of uncertainty by:

- the possible use of multi-scenario techniques in determining the plans;

- alternatively, adjustments to the rates used for discounting the flows;

- update of the assumptions underlying the impairment tests at 31.12.2020 compared to the
previous tests.

On this basis, the management has defined a single plan for each CGU (approved by the Board of
Directors) which represents the normal and expected scenario, with reference to the period 20212027 and which was used for the development of impairment tests. The recoverable value of
each CGU, determined on the basis of this plan, was subjected to stress tests and sensitivity
analyzes which also took into consideration economic parameters and as a result of which
positive results emerged.

The value in use of each CGU was calculated on the basis of a cost of asset (Ka) applied to the
forecast operating cash flow projections of 8%, unchanged from last year, and a perpetual
growth rate (g) by 1.5%, down from the previous year when it was 2%.

The recoverable value determined on the basis of the aforementioned assumptions and valuation
techniques was higher than the book value of the assets allocated to the three CGUs,
consequently the carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2020 is considered recoverable

The management has prepared an alternative scenario to verify the effects of this latter on the
assets’ value.

For Flos, the headroom emerged is 71.8 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been
prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the
revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom
emerged was 49.7 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case
higher than the book value.

For B&B, the headroom emerged is 174,3 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been
prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the
revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom
emerged was 146.7 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case
higher than the book value.

For LP, the headroom emerged is 121,1 million Euros. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been
prepared, considering the last two years of the plan and has previewed a reduction of the

revenues of 1%, and a reduction of the Ebitda margin of 0,5%. In this scenario the headroom
emerged was 113,3 million Euros. Therefore, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in any case
higher than the book value.

Furthermore, the management has prepared an alternative valuation scenario (stress test) which
provides for the determination of the recoverable amount per CGU over a period of a 5-year
plan, in line with the dictates of the accounting standard; no impairment indicators emerged
from this analysis.

- “B&B”, “Maxalto” and “Arclinea” equal to Euro 201.248 thousand;

- “Louis Poulsen”, equal to Euro 123.448 thousand.

Trademarks are considered with an indefinite useful life and therefore subject to annual
impairment test.

The recoverable amount of the trademarks has been verified by determining a royalty rate
among 6% -7%, which a third party would be willing to pay to the owners of the brands, applied
to the forecast revenue provided by the business plan. Using a discount rate of 8%, the
recoverable value of trademarks was higher than the book value.

The management has prepared an alternative scenario, considering the last two years of the plan
and expected a reduction in revenues of 1%, and a reduction in the royalty rate of 0.2%, to
verify the effects of this scenario on the value of the brands. No Brand impairment are due in this
latter case.

**10** **RIGHT OF USE AND FINANCIAL LEASE LIABILITIES**

The Group has existing leases covering land and buildings, plants and machinery, vehicles and
other equipment that are used in operational activities. Land and construction leases generally
last between 2 and 24 years, plant and machinery leases generally last between 2 and 8 years,
while those for vehicles and other equipment generally last between 2 and 5 years.

The group’s liabilities relating to these leasing agreements are guaranteed by the title of the
landlord’s property on the leased assets. Generally, the Group may not in turn lease the leased
assets to third parties and certain contracts require the group to comply with certain liquidity
indices. There are many leasing agreements that include options for renewal and cancellation
and variable payments that are best described below.

The group also has certain leases for machinery whose lifespan is 12 months or less and office
equipment whose value is modest. The group has chosen for these contracts to apply the
exemptions provided by IFRS16 for short-term or low value assets.

Set out below are the carrying amounts of right-of-use assets recognized and the movements
during the period:

Many lessors have provided rent concessions to lessees because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rent
concessions can include rent holidays or rent reductions for a period, possibly followed by
increased rent payments in future periods. Applying the requirements in IFRS 16 for changes to
lease payments, particularly assessing whether the rent concessions are lease modifications and
applying the required accounting, could be practically difficult in the current environment. The
objective of the amendment is to provide lessees that have been granted Covid-19 related rent
concessions with practical relief, while still providing useful information about leases to users of
the financial statements.

As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent
concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any
change in lease payments resulting from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way it
would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. The
practical expedient applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of the
Covid-19 pandemic.

A lessee that applies the practical expedient discloses that it has applied the practical expedient
to all rent concessions that meet the conditions for the practical expedient or, if not applied to
all such rent concessions, information about the nature of the contracts to which it has applied
the practical expedient. In addition, a lessee discloses the amount recognized in profit or loss to
reflect changes in lease payments that arise from such rent concessions to which the lessee has
applied the practical expedient.

Entities will need to assess whether the regulator in their jurisdiction allows the use of the relief
and the date from which it is effective.

The Group during the year, recorded reductions in leasing installments of approximately euro
94 thousand and mainly for the stores of Flos SpA and Flos France.

**11** **SHAREHOLDING IN PARENT COMPANY**

In December 2019, IDG has bought shares of its Parent Company, Design Holding S.p.A., for Euro
18.006 thousand. This amount is considered the fair value of the investment. As of December
2020, the fair value of the investment amount to Euro 23.569 and due to the revaluation on the
basis of the equity value of the parent company.

The measurement of the employee severance indemnity for IAS purposes follows the method of
the projection of the present value of the defined benefits obligation with the estimate of the
benefits accrued by employees.

Following the changes introduced by Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006 (“2007 Budget Act”) and
by the following implementing Decrees and Regulations, the portions of employee severance
indemnity accrued until December 31, 2006 will continue to remain in the company configuring a
defined benefits plan (obligation for the accrued benefits subject to actuarial valuation), while
the portions accruing from January 1, 2007 onwards, by effect of the choices made by the
employees during the year, will be allocated to complementary pension plans or transferred by
the company to the treasury provision managed by INPS and starting from the time the decision
is formalised by the employee, they are defined contribution plans (no longer subject to actuarial
valuation). Hence, the employee severance indemnity is determined as a result of the application
of an actuarial model based on several demographic and economic assumptions.

The following table shows the technical economic assumptions used:

**Dec-31-20** **Dec-31-19**

Annual discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0,02% 0,37%

Annual rate of increase of employee severance indemnity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,10% 2,40%

In particular, the annual discount rate used to determine the annual value of the obligation was
obtained, consistently with Paragraph 83 of IAS 19, from the Iboxx Corporate AA index recorded
on the date of the measurement. For this purpose, the return whose duration is comparable to
the collective duration of the evaluated Company was selected.

**21** **PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND OTHER CHARGES**

Provisions for risks and charges, totalling Euro 10.986 thousand, include:

- Provisions for pension liabilities and the like, amounting to Euro 4.608 thousand;

- Provisions for products’ warranty, amounting to Euro 3.512 thousand;

- Other Provisions, amounting to Euro 2.866 thousand.

parent (after adjusting for interest on the convertible preference shares) by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average
number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential
ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

### Independent auditor’s report pursuant to ar�cle 14 of Legislative Decree n. 39, dated 27 January 2010 (Transla�on from the original Italian text)

To the sole Shareholder of
Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A.

### Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

##### Opinion 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Interna�onal Design Group (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated statement of financial posi�on as at 31 December 2019, and the consolidated statement of
income, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements,
including a summary of significant accoun�ng policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial posi�on of the
Group as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with Interna�onal Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union.

##### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia). Our responsibili�es
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements sec�on of our report._
We are independent of Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. in accordance with the regula�ons and standards on
ethics and independence applicable to audits of financial statements under Italian Laws. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

##### Responsibili�es of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for the prepara�on of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with International Financial Repor�ng Standards as adopted by the European Union, and,
within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
prepara�on of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern and, when preparing
the consolidated financial statements, for the appropriateness of the going concern assump�on, and for
appropriate disclosure thereof. The Directors prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern
basis unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company Interna�onal Design Group S.p.A. or to cease
opera�ons, or have no realis�c alterna�ve but to do so.

The statutory audit commi�ee (“Collegio Sindacale”) is responsible, within the terms provided by the law, for
overseeing the Group’s financial repor�ng process.

##### Auditor’s Responsibili�es for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 

Our objec�ves are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Interna�onal Standards on Audi�ng (ISA Italia), we have exercised
professional judgment and maintained professional skep�cism throughout the audit. In addi�on:
we have iden�fied and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detec�ng a material misstatement resul�ng from fraud is higher than for one
resul�ng from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten�onal omissions, misrepresenta�ons, or
the override of internal control;
we have obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effec�veness of the Group’s internal control;
we have evaluated the appropriateness of accoun�ng policies used and the reasonableness of accoun�ng
es�mates and related disclosures made by the Directors;
we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accoun�ng
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
condi�ons that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to con�nue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw a�en�on in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to consider this
ma�er in forming our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or condi�ons may cause the Group to cease to con�nue
as a going concern;
we have evaluated the overall presenta�on, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transac�ons and events in a manner that achieves fair presenta�on;
we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial informa�on of the en��es
or business ac�vi�es within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direc�on, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, iden�fied at an appropriate level as required by ISA
Italia, regarding, among other ma�ers, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden�fy during our audit.

In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of 2018, IDG reported provisional
figures regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in November 2018 when the
Group has been formed. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of 31[st]

December 2019, IDG has completed the activities concerning the fair value measurement of assets
and liabilities, with the support of an independent expert, and has reviewed the balances at the
acquisition date redetermining the value of the Goodwill. As stated by IFRS 3.49, these
adjustments have been calculated upon the acquisition date (November 2018) and therefore the
main consolidated financial statements’ schemes have been re-exposed as of 31[st] December 2018.

In paragraph 7, all the definitive values regarding the business combination and the

The net Equity and the result at December 31, 2018 is reduced by Euro 5.168 thousand as a result
of the reversal of part of the surplus value identified in the inventories that were sold in 2018 net
of the theoretical fiscal effect.

Inventories as of December 31, 2018 are increased because of the higher value recognized to
finished and half-finished products net of the reversal in 2018.

Intangible assets are increased as a result of the higher value recognized to the brands for Euro
333.709 thousand.

Deferred taxes as of December 31, 2018 are increased by Eur 98.963 as a result of the recognition
of the theoretical tax effect on surplus values net of the reversal occurred in 2018.

**2** **ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group were prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB).

The consolidated financial statements were prepared according to the historical cost convention,
with the exception of the recognition of derivative financial instruments and of available-for-sale
(AFS) financial assets, which are recognized at fair value. The carrying amount of the assets and
liabilities subjected to fair value hedging and that would otherwise by recognized at the
amortized cost, is adjusted to take into account variations in the fair value attributable to the
hedged risks.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro and all values are expressed in
thousands of euro, unless otherwise directed.

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

**3** **CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of International Design
Group S.p.A. and of its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019.

Control is obtained when the Group is exposed or is entitled to variable returns, deriving from its
relations with the investee entity and, at the same time, is able to affect such returns by
exercising its power over that entity.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- power over the investee entity (i.e. it owns valid rights that currently entitle it to manage the
significant activities of the investee entity);

- exposure or rights to variable returns deriving from the relationships with the investee entity;

- the ability to exercise its own power on the investee entity to affect the amount of its returns.

When the Group holds less than the majority of the voting rights (or similar rights) it must
consider all relevant facts and circumstances to establish whether it controls the investee entity,
including:

- Contractual agreements with other holders of voting rights;

- Rights deriving from contractual agreements;

- Voting rights and potential voting rights of the Group.

The Group reconsiders whether or not it has control of an investee if the facts and circumstances
indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the three elements with relevance for the
purposes of the definition of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary starts when the Group
obtains control thereof and ceases when the Group loses control. The assets, liabilities, revenues
and costs of the subsidiary acquired or sold during the year are included in the statement of
comprehensive income from the date on which the Group obtains control until the date on
which the Group no longer exercises control of the company.

The profit/(loss) for the year and each of the other comprehensive income are attributed to the
shareholders of the parent company and to minority interests, even if this implies that minority
interests have a negative balance. When necessary, the appropriate adjustments are made to the
financial statements of the subsidiaries, to assure compliance with the group’s accounting
policies. All assets and liabilities, the shareholders’ equity, the revenues, costs and intercompany
cash flows relating to transactions between group entities are fully eliminated in the
consolidation phase.

Changes in the shareholdings in a subsidiary that do not entail a loss of control are recognized in
the shareholders’ equity.

If the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it must eliminate the related assets (including
goodwill), liabilities, minority interests and the other shareholders’ equity components, while any
profit or loss is recognised in the income statement. Any retained shareholder shall be recognized
at fair value.

**4** **SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**

**4.1** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL**

Business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is
determined as the sum of the transferred price, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date,
and of the amount of the minority interest in the acquired entity. For each business combination,
the Group defines whether to measure the minority interest in the acquired entity at fair value
or proportionally to the minority interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. The
acquisition cost are expensed in the year and classified among administrative expenses.

When the Group acquires a business, it classifies or designates the financial assets acquired or the
liabilities assumed in accordance with the contractual terms, the economic conditions and the
other pertinent conditions existing at the date of acquisition. This includes the check to
determine whether an embedded derivative has to be separated from the primary contract.

Any potential price to be paid is recognized by the purchaser at fair value at the date of
acquisition. The potential price classified as asset is not subject to remeasurement and its
subsequent payment is recognized with the shareholders’ equity as a balancing entry. The
change in the fair value of the potential price classified as asset or liability, as a financial
instrument that is in the subject of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, shall be recognised in the income
statement in accordance with IFRS 9. The potential price that is not included in the scope of IFRS
9 is measured at fair value at the date of the financial statements and fair value variations are
recognised in the income statement.

Goodwill is initially recognized at the cost represented by the surplus of the set of the price paid
and of the amount recorded for minority interests with respect to the identifiable net assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Group. If the fair value of the net assets acquired
exceeds the set of the price paid, the Group verifies again whether it correctly identified all
acquired assets and all assumed liabilities and it revises the procedures used to determine the
amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the new measurement again yields a higher
fair value of the net assets acquired than the price, then the difference (gain) is recognized in the
income statement.

After the initial recognition, goodwill is measured at the cost net of accumulated impairment
losses. For the purpose of the impairment test, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is
allocated, from the date of acquisition, to each cash-generating unit of the Group expected to
benefit from the synergies of the aggregation, regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of
the acquired entity are assigned to these units.

If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the entity disposes of some of the assets
of this unit, the goodwill associated with the disposed asset is included in the carrying amount of
the asset when the gain or the loss of the disposal is determined. The goodwill associated with
the disposed asset is determined on the basis of the relative values of the disposed asset and of
the retained part of the cash-generating unit.

**4.2** **CURRENT/NON-CURRENT CLASSIFICATION**

The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of the Group are classified according to the
current/non-current criterion.

An asset is current when:

- it is supposed to be realized, or is held for sale or consumption, in the course of the normal
operating cycle;

- it is held mainly for the purpose of trading;

- it is supposed to be realised within twelve months from the closing date of the year; or

F-83


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

- it consists of cash and cash equivalents unless it is forbidden to trade it or use it to extinguish a
liability for at least twelve months from the closing date of the year.

All other assets are classified either as non-current and current.

A liability is current when:

- it is expected to be extinguished in its normal operating cycle;

- it is held mainly for the purpose of trading;

- it must be extinguished within twelve months from the closing date of the year; or

- the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer payment of the liability for at least
twelve months from the closing date of the year.

The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.

Assets and liabilities for deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified among non-current assets
and liabilities.

**4.3** **TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EXPRESSED IN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY FROM**
**THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY**

The rules for the translation of the financial statements of the subsidiaries expressed in currencies
other the Euro, are as follows:

- assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rates prevailing at the reference date of
the consolidated financial statements (December 31);

- costs and revenues are converted at the average exchange rate of the period;

- the translation reserve includes both the exchange differences generated by the conversion of
the amounts at a different rate from the closing rate and those generated by the translation of
the opening shareholders’ equity amounts at a different exchange rate from the one prevailing
on the closing date of the reporting period;

- the goodwill and adjustments deriving from fair value related to the acquisition of a foreign
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange
rate prevailing on the closing date of the period.

The exchange rates applied in the conversion of the asset and liability balances in currencies
other than the Euro at December 31, 2019 and the average rates of the period from December 1,
2019—December 31, 2019 are as follows:

**4.4** **FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT**

The Group measures non-financial assets at fair value at each reporting date.

The fair value is the price that would be collected for the sale of an asset, or that would be paid
for the transfer of a liability, in a regular transaction between market operators at the
measurement date.

A measurement of the fair value supposes that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability
takes place:

a) in the main market of the asset or liability; or

b) in the absence of a main market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The main market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for the Group.

The fair value of an asset or liability is measured adopting the assumptions that market operators
would use in determining the price of the asset or liability, presuming that they act to best satisfy
their own economic interest.

A measurement of the fair value of a non-financial asset considers the capability of a market
operator to generate economic benefits employing the asset it its maximum and best use or
selling it to another market operator who would employ it in its maximum and best use.

The Group uses measurement techniques that are suitable for the circumstances and for which
there are sufficient available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of significant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of non-observable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which the fair value is assessed or exposed in the financial statements
are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy, as described below:

- Level 1—The (unadjusted) listed prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities which
the entity can access at the measurement date;

- Level 2—Inputs other than the listed prices included in Level 1, observable directly or indirectly
for the assets or for the liability;

- Level 3—Measurement techniques for which the input data are not observable for the asset or
for the liability.

The fair value measurement is entirely classified in the same level of the fair value hierarchy in
which the lowest input in the hierarchy used for the measurement is classified.

For the assets and liabilities recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group
determines whether there have been any transfers between the levels of the hierarchy revising
the categorization (based on the lowest level input, that is significant for the purposes of the fair
value measurement as a whole) at each reporting date.

For the purposes of the information about fair value, the Group determines the classes of assets
and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or of the liability
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as illustrated above.

**4.5** **REVENUE RECOGNITION**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods and services is
transferred to the customer for an amount that reflects the price the Group expects to receive in
exchange for such goods or services.

Revenue is recognised to the extent to which it is probable that the economic benefits are
achieved by the Group and the related amount can be determined reliably, regardless of the date
of collection. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the price received or to be received, taking

F-85


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

into account the contractually defined payment terms and excluding taxes and duties. The Group
concluded that it is operating on its own behalf in all sales contracts inasmuch as it is the primary
debtor, it has discretionality on the price policy and it is also exposed to inventory and credit risk.

**4.5.1 SALE OF GOODS**

The revenue is recognized when the company has transferred all significant risks and benefits
connected to the ownership of the asset to the purchaser, generally on the date of delivery of
the goods.

The revenue is valued at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received, net of
returns and rebates, commercial discounts and volume reductions. Subsidiaries provide a
two-year warranty on repair, in line with industry practice. Customers are not provided with
additional guarantees and maintenance contracts.

**4.5.2 DIVIDENDS**

Dividends are recognized when the right to receive payment is established, which generally
corresponds to the time when the Shareholders’ Meeting approves their distribution.

**4.5.3 RENTAL REVENUES**

Rents deriving from property investments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
duration of the existing lease contracts at the balance sheet date and are classified as revenues,
taking into account their operational nature.

**4.6** **INCOME TAXES**

**4.6.1 CURRENT TAXES**

Current taxes of the year are measured for the amount expected to be recovered from or to be
paid to the tax authorities. The rates and the tax regulations used to calculate the amount are
those promulgated, or substantially in force, at the reporting date in the countries where the
Group operates and generates its own taxable income.

Current taxes relating to items recognized directly in the shareholders’ equity are also recognized
in the shareholders’ equity and not in the statement of the profit/(loss) for the period. The
Management periodically assesses the position assumed in the income tax return in the cases in
which the tax rules are subject to interpretation and, when appropriate, it allocates provisions.

For Ires purposes, IDG S.p.A. and its Italian subsidiaries, for the three-year period 2019-2021,
adhere to the national tax consolidation regime, all as subsidiaries consolidated with the Parent
Company Design Holding S.p.A., with which a special contract has been entered into to regulate
transferred tax contracts.

The national tax consolidation regime, which is governed by the art. 117-129 DPR 917/86,
provides a single group tax base at the head of the consolidating company, accordingly:

(i) in the balance sheet, all items relating to the regulation of Ires are classified as intragroup tax
reports;

(ii) in the profit and loss, proceeds and/or consolidation costs for the remuneration of the tax
accounts, transferred to the consolidator and used by the consolidator as part of the settlement
of its taxes, are shown.

**4.6.2 DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**

Deferred taxes are calculated applying the “liability method” to temporary differences at the
date of the financial statements between the tax values of the assets and liabilities and the
corresponding financial statement values.

F-86


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences, with the following
exceptions:

- deferred tax liabilities derive from the initial recognition of the goodwill of an asset or liability
in a transaction that does not represent a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction itself, influences neither the result of the financial statements nor the result for tax
purposes;

- the reversal of taxable temporary differences, associated with equity investments in
subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, can be controlled, and it is probable that it will not
occur in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised in view of all deductible temporary differences, of receivables
and of unused tax losses that can be carried forward, to the extent to which it is probable that
sufficient future taxable income will be available, which will allow utilisation of deductible
temporary differences and of receivables and tax losses carried forward, excepting the cases in
which:

- the deferred tax asset connected with deductible temporary differences derive from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that does not represent a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction itself, influences neither the result of the
financial statements nor the result for tax purposes;

- in the case of deductible temporary differences associated with equity investments in
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
to which it is probable that they will be reversed in the foreseeable future and that there will
be sufficient taxable income that allows to recover these temporary differences.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is re-examined at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent to which it is no longer probable that in the future there will be sufficient taxable
income to allow the receivable to be used in full or in part. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are
re-examined at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent to which it becomes
probable that taxable income will be sufficient to allow these taxes to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the tax rate expected to be
applied during the year in which these assets will be realised or these liabilities will be
extinguished, considering the rates in force and the ones already promulgated, or substantially in
force, on the date of the financial statements.

Deferred taxes relating to elements recognised outside the income statement are also recognised
outside the income statement and, hence, in the shareholders’ equity or in the statement of
comprehensive income, consistently with the element to which they refer.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legal right that allows to
offset current tax receivables and current tax payables, and the deferred taxes refer to the same
taxpayer and to the same tax authority.

**4.6.3** **INDIRECT TAXES**

Costs, revenues, assets and liabilities are recognised net of indirect taxes, such as the value added
tax, with the following exceptions:

- the tax applied to the purchase of goods or services is not deductible; in this case it is
recognised as a part of the purchase cost of the asset or part of the cost recognised in the
income statement;

- trade receivables and payables include the applicable indirect tax.

The net amount of the indirect taxes to be recovered or to be paid to the Tax Authorities is
included in the financial statements among receivables or among payables.

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

**4.7** **ASSETS HELD FOR DISPOSAL**

The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale/disposal if their carrying amount will be
recovered mainly with a sale transaction instead of through their continuous use. These
non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower between the carrying
amount and their fair value net of selling costs. Selling costs are additional costs directly
attributable to the sale, excluding financial costs and taxes.

The condition for classification as held for sale is considered to be met only when the sale is
highly probable and the asset for disposal is available for immediate sale in its current conditions.
The actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is improbable that there may be
significant changes in the sale or that the sale may be cancelled. The Management must be
committed to the sale, whose completion should be expected within one year from the date of
classification.

The assets and the liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately among the
current items in the financial statements.

An asset for disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is part of an entity that was
disposed or is classified as held for sale, and:

- it represents an important autonomous business unit or geographic business area,

- it is part of a single coordinated plan for the disposal of an important business unit or
geographic business area,

- it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively in view of a resale.

Additional information about the assets for disposal is provided in the Note “Assets held for
disposal”. All the other notes to the financial statement include amounts relating to operating
assets, unless otherwise indicated.

**4.8** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

Property, plant and machinery are measured at the cost of purchase or of production, net of the
accumulated depreciation and of any accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes ever
expense directly incurred to prepare the assets for their use, as well as any disposal and removal
expenses that will be incurred consequently to contractual obligations that required bringing the
asset back to the original conditions. Any interest expenses incurred for the acquisition,
production or construction of the property, plant and machinery are capitalised on the value of
the related asset until it is available for use.

The expenses incurred for ordinary and/or cyclical maintenance and repairs are charged directly
to the income statement in the year incurred. The capitalisation of costs inherent to the
expansion, modernization or improvement of the structural elements owned or used by third
parties is made solely to the extent that they meet the conditions for being classified separately
as an asset or part of an asset under the component approach method. Similarly, the replacement
costs of the identifiable components of complex assets are recognised among the assets and
amortised according to their estimated useful life; the residual carrying amount of the replaced
component is recognised in the income statement.

The annual depreciation rates, representative of the estimated useful life for categories of
tangible assets, are the follows:

The useful life of the tangible assets and the residual value are revised and updated, when
applicable, at the closing of each year.

When the depreciable asset is composed of distinctly identifiable elements, the useful life of
which differs significantly from that of the other parts which compose the asset, depreciation is
taken separately for each of the parts which make up the asset under the “component
approach” principle.

The profits and losses deriving from sales or disposals of assets are determined as the difference
between the sale revenue and the net book value of the disposed or sold asset and are charged
to the income statement of the year of accrual.

Improvements to third-party assets are classified in tangible assets, consistently with the nature
of the cost incurred. The depreciation period corresponds to the lower between the residual
useful life of the tangible asset and the residual duration of the lease agreement.
Land is not depreciated.

**4.8.1** **LEASING**

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration.

_Group as a lessee_

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for
short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make
lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial
direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any

F-89


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

- Land and Buildings 2 to 24 years

- Plant and machinery 2 to 8 years

- Industrial and commercial equipment 2 to 5 years

- Other Assets 2 to 5 years

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost
reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful
life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section
Impairment of non-financial assets (see Notes 4.13—6.2.1).

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include
fixed payments (including in- substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable,
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid
under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase
option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition
that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate
at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily
determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to
reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change
in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an
option to purchase the underlying asset.

The Group’s lease liabilities are included in Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (see Notes 11—
23).

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of
machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the
commencement date and do not contain a purchase option).

It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value
assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**4.9** **OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

Other intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost, whereas those
acquired through business combinations are recognised at fair value at the date of purchase.
After the initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised at cost net of accumulated

F-90

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

amortisation and of any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets produced internally,
with the exception of the development costs, are not capitalised and are recognised in the
income statement of the year in which they were incurred.

The useful life of intangible assets is assessed as finite or indefinite.

Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised throughout their useful life and they are
subjected to impairment test every time there are indications of a possible impairment loss. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method of an intangible asset with definite useful life
is reconsidered at least at the end of each year. Changes in the expected useful life or in the ways
with which future economic benefits tied to the asset will be realised are recognised through the
change of the period or of the amortisation method, depending on the case, and they are
considered changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation rates of intangible assets with
definite useful life are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost
category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised, but are annually subjected to
impairment test, both at the individual level and at the level of cash generating unit. The
assessment of the indefinite useful life is revised annually to determine whether this attribution
continuous to be sustainable, otherwise, the change from indefinite useful life to defined useful
life is applied prospectively.

The gains or losses deriving from the elimination of an intangible asset are measured from the
difference between the net revenue of the disposal and the carrying amount of the intangible
asset and are recognised in the profit/(loss) of the year in the year when the derecognition takes
place.

**4.9.1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS**

Research costs are allocated in the income statement of the year in which they are incurred. The
development costs incurred in relation to a determined project are recognised as intangible
assets when the Group is able to demonstrate:

- the technical possibility of completing the intangible asset, so that it is available for use or sale;

- the intention to complete the asset and the Group’s ability to use it or sell it;

- the ways in which the asset will generate future economic benefits;

- the availability of resources to complete the asset;

- the ability to reliably asset the cost attributable to the asset during development;

- the ability to use the intangible asset generated.

After the initial recognition, development assets are measured at cost minus amortisation or
accumulated impairment losses. The amortisation of the asset starts when development is
completed and the asset is available for use. Development activities are amortised with reference
to the period of the expected benefits and the related amortisation rates are included in the cost
of goods sold.

During the development period the asset is subjected to annual impairment test.

**4.9.2** **TRADEMARKS, LICENCES AND SIMILAR RIGHTS**

Amortisation of Licences is calculated with linear method so as to allocate the cost incurred for
the acquisition of the right along the shorter period from the expected utilisation period and the
duration of the related agreement starting from the time when the acquired right becomes
exercisable. Software licences are amortised with linear method on the period deemed
representative of the related useful life, i.e. 5 years.

**4.9.3** **TRADEMARK**

The brands included in the consolidated balance sheet, present in the balance sheets of the
groups of which IDG gained control through the extraordinary transaction that took place in
2018, are represented mainly by the brands “FLOS”, “B&B”, Maxalto”, “Arclinea” and “Louis
Poulsen”.

Brands have been granted indefinite useful life (and, therefore, it is not subject to the
depreciation process), as:

- play a priority role in the Group’s strategy and are a primary value driver;

- the company structure, in its concept of organized material goods and organization itself in a
broad sense, is strongly related and dependent on the diffusion and development of brands on
the markets;

- Trademarks are owned and are correctly registered and constantly protected from a regulatory
point of view, with options for renewing legal protection when registration periods expire;

- the products marketed by the Group under these brands are not subject to particular
technological obsolescence, as is also characteristic for the “luxury” market in which the Group
operates, and indeed, are perceived by the market as constantly innovative and trendy, so as to
become models to imitate or to be inspired;

- the brand is characterized, in the national and/or international context, by a market
positioning and notoriety that ensures its pre-eminence in the respective market segments
being constantly associated and compared to the brands of absolute reference.

As of December 31, 2019, it was considered appropriate to subject the brand to a separate
impairment test in order to verify the consistency of the values entered in the budget, with the
criteria described below.

**4.10** **FINANCIAL ASSETS**

A financial instrument is any contract originating a financial asset for an entity and a financial
liability or an equity instrument for another entity.

i) Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are classified, according to the case, on the basis
of the subsequent measurement procedures, i.e. at amortised cost, at fair value recognised in
other comprehensive income OCI and at the fair value recognised in the income statement.

The classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition depends on the
characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the business model
used by the Group for their management. With the exception of trade receivables that do not
contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied the practical
expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value recognised in the income statement, the transaction costs. Trade

F-92


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group applied
the practical expedient are measured at the price of the transaction determined according to IFRS
15. Please refer to the paragraph of the accounting principles (e) Revenue from contracts with
customers.

For a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at fair value in OCI, where
to generate cash flows that depend solely on the principal and interest on the amount of the
principal to be repaid (‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’). This assessment is
indicated as SPPI test and it is carried out at the instrument level.

The Group’s business model for the management of financial assets refers to the way in which it
manages its own financial assets to generate cash flows. The corporate model determines
whether the cash flows will derive from the collection of contractual cash flows, from the sale of
financial assets or from both.

The purchase or the sale of a financial asset that requires its delivery within a time interval
generally established by regulation or market convention (standardized or regular way trade) is
recognised at the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Group committed to purchase or sell the
asset.

Subsequent measurement

For the purposes of the subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four
categories:

- Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with
reclassification of earnings and accumulated losses (debt instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income without
reversal of earnings and accumulated losses at the time of elimination (equity instruments);

- Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement.

Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)

The Group measures financial assets at amortized cost if both of the following requirements are
met:

- the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is possession of
financial assets directed at the collection of contractual cash flows and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented
solely by payments of the principal and of the interest on the amount of the principal to be
repaid.

Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest criterion
and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when
the asset is derecognised, modified or revalued.

The Group’s financial assets at amortized cost include trade receivables and a loan to a director
included in the other non-current financial assets.

Financial assets at fair value recognised in the OCI (debt instruments)

The Group measures debt instrument assets at fair value recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:

- the financial asset is held within the scope of a business model whose objective is achieved
both through the collection of contractual cash flows and through the sale of the financial
assets and

F-93


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

- the contractual terms of the financial asset provide at determined dates cash flows represented
solely by payments of the principal and interest determined on the amount of the principal to
be repaid.

For assets from debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the interest income,
the changes due to exchange differences and the impairment losses, together with write-backs,
are recognised in the income statement and they are calculated in the same way as the financial
assets measured at amortized cost. The remaining changes in fair value are recognised in OCI. At
the time of derecognition, the cumulative change in fair value recognised in OCI is reclassified in
the income statement.

Assets from debt instruments of the Group measured at fair value recognised in OCI comprise the
investments in listed debt instruments included in the other non-current financial assets.

Investments in equity instruments

Upon initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably opt to classify its own equity related
investments as equity instruments recognised at fair value recognised in OCI when they meet the
definition of equity instruments in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation”
and are not held for trading. The classification is determined for each individual instrument.

The gains and losses achieved on these financial assets are never recognised in the income
statement. Dividends are recognised as other revenue in the income statement when the right to
payment was resolved, except when the Group benefits from this income as a recovery of part of
the cost of the financial asset, in which case these gains are recognised in OCI. Equity investments
recognised at fair value in OCI are not subjected to impairment testing.

The Group opted to classify irrevocably its own unlisted equity investments in this category.

Financial assets at fair value recognised in the income statement

This category comprises assets held for trading, assets designated upon first recognition as
financial assets at fair values with changes recognised in the income statement, or the financial
assets that must mandatorily be measured at fair value. Assets held for trading are all assets
acquired for their sale or their repurchase in the short term. Derivatives, including
non-embedded ones, are classified as financial instruments held for trading, unless they are
designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial assets with cash flows not represented
solely by payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value recognised
in the income statement, regardless of the business model. In spite of the criteria for debt
instruments to be classified at amortized cost or at fair value recognised in OCI, as described
above, debt instruments can be recorded at fair value recognised in the income statement at the
time of initial recognition if this entail the derecognition or the significant reduction of an
accounting misalignment.

Financial instruments at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement are recorded
in the statement of financial position at fair value and net changes in fair value recognised in the
statement of profit/(loss) for the year.

This category includes the derivative instruments and the listed equity investments the Group has
not irrevocably chosen to classify at fair value recognised in OCI. Dividends on listed equity
investments are also recognised as other income in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year
when the right to the payment has been established. The embedded derivative contained in a
hybrid non-derivative contract, in a financial liability or in a non-financial main contract, is
separated from the main contract and accounted for as a separate derivative, if: its economic
characteristics and the risks associated therewith are not closely related to those of the main
contract; a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would satisfy
the definition as a derivative; and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value recognised in
the income statement. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with changes in fair

F-94


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

value recognised in the income statement. A redetermination takes place only if there is a
change in the terms of the contract that significantly changes the cash flows otherwise expected
or a reclassification of a financial asset to a different category from fair value in the income
statement.

An embedded derivative included in a hybrid contract that contains a financial asset is not
separated from the host contract. The financial asset together with the embedded derivative is
classified internally as a financial asset at fair value recognised in the income statement.

Write-off

A financial asset (or, when applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets) is written off in the first place (e.g. removed from the statement of financial
position of the Group) when:

- the rights to receive the cash flows from the assets are extinguished, or

- the Group transferred to a third party the right to receive cash flows from the asset or assumed
the contractual obligation to pay them in full and without delay and (a) transferred substantially
all risks and benefits of the ownership of the financial asset, or (b) did not transfer or retained
substantially all the risks and benefits of the asset, but it transferred control thereof.

If the Group transferred the rights to receive cash flows from an asset or executed an agreement
whereby it maintains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but it
assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more beneficiaries (passthrough), it assesses whether and to which extent it maintained the risks and the benefits
inherent to possession. If it did not transfer or retained substantially all risks and benefits or it
did not lose control thereon, the asset continues to be recognised in the financial statements of
the Group to the extent of its residual involvement in the asset. In this case, the Group also
recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liabilities are measured
so as to reflect the rights and the obligations that remain the Group’s.

When the residual involvement of the entity is a guarantee on the transferred asset, the
involvement is measured on the basis of the lesser between the amount of the asset and the
maximum amount of the consider received which the entity may have to repay.

Impairment of financial assets

Additional information about the impairment of financial losses is also provided in the note
“Discretionary assessments and significant accounting estimates”.

The Group records an impairment for expected losses (expected credit loss, ‘ECL’) for all financial
assets represented by debt instruments not held at fair value recognised in the income statement.
ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the
contract and all the cash flows the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of
the original effective interest rate. The cash flows will include the cash flows deriving from the
enforcement of the collateral held or of other guarantees on the receivable which are integral
parts of the contractual conditions.

The expected losses are recognised in two steps. In relation to the credit exposures for which
there was not significant increase of the credit risk from the initial recognition, it is necessary to
recognise the losses on receivables that derive from the estimation of default events that are
possible within the subsequent 12 months (12-month ECL). For the credit exposures for which
there was a significant increase of the credit risk from initial recognition, it is necessary to fully
recognise the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure, regardless of
the time when the default event is forecast to occur (“Lifetime ECL”).

For trade receivables and assets deriving from contracts, the Group applies a simplified approach
in the calculation of the expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not monitor changes to the

F-95


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

credit risk, but it fully recognises the expected loss at each reference date. The Group defined a
matrix system based on historical information, revised to consider prospective elements with
reference to the specific types of debtors and their economic environment, as an instrument for
determining the expected losses.

For assets represented by debt instruments measured at fair value recognised in OCI, the Group
applies the simplified approach allowed for assets with low credit risk. At each reference date of
the financial statements, the Group assesses whether the debt instrument has a low credit risk
using all the available information that can be obtained without excessive costs or efforts. In
carrying out the assessment, the Group monitors the credit rating of the debt instrument.

The financial assets represented by debt instruments held by the Group measured at fair value
recognised in OCI comprise exclusively listed bonds classified in the best categories of credit
rating and, hence, they are considered investments with low credit risk. The Group’s policy is to
measure the expected losses in the subsequent 12 months on these instruments on an annual
basis. However, when a significant increase of the credit risk occurred, the Group fully recognises
the expected losses that refer to the residual duration of the exposure.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the contractual payments have been
past due for 90 days. In some cases, the Group can also consider that a financial asset is in default
when internal or external information indicate that it is improbable that the Group will fully
recover the contractual amounts before considering the guarantees on the credit held by the
Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery of the
contractual cash flows.

**4.11** **FINANCIAL LIABILITIES**

_Recognition and initial measurement_

Financial liabilities are classified, at the time of the initial recognition, among financial liabilities
at fair value recognised in the income statement, among mortgages and loans, or among
derivatives designated as hedging instruments.

All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value to which are added, in the cases of
mortgages, loans and payables, the transaction costs directly attributable thereto.

The financial liabilities of the Group comprise trade payables and other payables, mortgages and
loans, including current account overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

_Subsequent measurement_

The assessment of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described above:

Financial liabilities at fair value recognised in the income statement

Financial liabilities recognised at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement
comprise liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value with
changes recognised in the income statement.

Liabilities held for trading are all those assumed with the intention of extinguishing them or
transferring them in the short term. This category also includes the derivative financial
instruments entered into by the Group which are not designated as hedging instruments in a
hedging relationship defined by IFRS 9. Embedded derivatives, separated from the main contract,
are classified as financial instruments held for trading unless they are designated as effective
hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for
the year.

F-96


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

Financial liabilities are designated at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement
from the date of initial recognition, only if the criteria of IFRS 9 are met. At the time of the initial
recognition, the Group did not designate financial liabilities at fair value with changes
recognised in the income statement.

_Loans and receivables_

This category is the most significant for the Group. After the initial recognition, loans are
measured with the amortized cost criterion using the effective interest rate method. Gains and
losses are recognised in the income statement when the liability is extinguished, as well as
through the amortization process.

The amortized cost is calculated noting the discount or the bonus on the acquisition and the fees
or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective
interest rate is included among financial expenses in the statement of profit/(loss). This category
generally includes interest-bearing receivables and loans.

_Write-off_

A financial liability is written off when the obligation underlying the liability is extinguished,
voided or fulfilled. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another one of the same lender,
at substantially different conditions, or the conditions of an existing liability are substantially
amended, this exchange or amendment is treated as an accounting write-off the original liability,
accompanied by the recognition of a new liability, with recognition in the statement of profit/
(liability) of the year of any differences between the carrying amounts.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_

A financial asset and liability can be offset and the net balance exposed in the statement of
financial position, if there is a current legal right to offset the amounts recognised in the
financial accounts and there is the intention of extinguishing the net residue, or realising the
asset and concurrently extinguishing the liability.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting_

_Initial recognition and subsequent measurement_

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as: forward foreign exchange contracts,
interest rate swaps and forward commodity acquisition contracts to cover respectively, its own
currency exchange rate risks, the interest rate risks and the commodity price risks. These
derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date on which the
derivative contract is entered into and, subsequently, they are again measured at fair value.
Derivatives are recorded as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
liabilities when the fair value is negative.

For hedge accounting purposes, there are three types of hedges:

- fair value hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against changes of the fair value of the
asset or liability recognised or unrecorded irrevocable commitment;

- cash flow hedging in case of hedge of the exposure against the variability of the cash flows
attributable to a particular risk associated with all assets or liabilities recognised or to a highly
probable planned transaction or the foreign currency risk on unrecorded irrevocable
commitment;

- hedge of a net investment in a foreign management.

**4.12** **INVENTORIES**

Inventories are measured at the lower amount between the cost and the value of presumable net
realisation.

F-97


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

The costs incurred to bring each good to the current place and conditions are recognised as
follows:

- the cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost method, with the exception of
the LP Group that measures inventories with the FIFO criterion;

- the cost of production is determined including all costs directly attributable to the products,
general production costs, defined on the basis of the normal production capacity, excluding
the financial expenses.

The LP method does not generate significant differences with respect to the weighted average
cost method. For the part of inventory deemed no longer usable economically, or with an
assumed realisation value that is lower than the cost recognised in the financial statements, a
dedicated write-down provision is allocated.

**4.13** **IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**

At every reporting date, the Group assesses the existence of any indicators of asset impairment
losses. In this case, or in cases requiring an annual impairment test, the Group estimates the
recoverable value. The recoverable value is the higher amount between the fair value of the
asset or cash-generating unit, net of selling costs, and its value in use. The recoverable value is
determined by individual asset, except when the asset generates cash flows that are not broadly
independent of those generated by other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an
asset is greater than its recoverable value, the asset has undergone an impairment and it is
consequently written down to its recoverable value.

In calculating the value in use, the Group discounts estimated future cash flows to present value
using a discount rate before taxes, which reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset. In calculating fair value net of selling costs, recent
transactions carried out on the market are taken into account. If these transactions cannot be
identified, an adequate valuation model is used. These calculations are supported by appropriate
valuation multipliers, prices of listed equities for investees whose securities are traded on the
market, and other available fair value indicators.

The Group bases its impairment test on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, prepared
separately for each cash-generating unit of the Group to which individual assets are allocated.
These budges and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. In case of longer
periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated, which is used to project future cash flows beyond
the fifth year.

For acquisitions occurred in proximity to the end of the year, the group could determine the
recoverable value calculating the fair value of the asset to be evaluated.

Impairment losses of operating assets, including the impairment losses of inventories, are
recognised in the statement of profit/(loss) for the year in the cost categories consistent with the
destination of the asset that underwent the impairment loss. Fixed assets previously revalued are
an exception, if the revaluation was recognised among the other comprehensive income. In these
cases, the impairment loss is in turn recognised among the other comprehensive income up to
the previous revaluation.

For assets other than goodwill, at each reporting date the Group assesses the existence of any
indications that the previously recognised impairment losses no longer apply (or were reduced)
and, if there are such indications, it estimates the recoverable value of the asset or of the CGU.
The value of an asset that was previously written down may be restored only if there were
changes in the assumptions on which the calculation of the determined recoverable value was
based, subsequent to the recognition of the last impairment loss. The write-back may not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, if
no impairment loss had been recognised in previous years. The write-back is recognised in the

F-98


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

statement of profit/(loss) for the year unless the asset is recognised at the written-back value, in
which case the write-back is treated as a revaluation increase.

The following criteria are used to account for impairment losses relating to specific types of
assets:

**4.13.1 GOODWILL**

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year (as at December 31) and, with greater
frequency, when the circumstances lead to believe that the book value could be subject to
impairment loss.

The impairment loss of the goodwill is determined measuring the recoverable value of the cashgenerating unit to which the goodwill is connected. When the recoverable value of the cashgenerating unit were lower than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which
goodwill was allocated, an impairment loss is recognised. The write-down of the value of
goodwill may not be restored in future years.

**4.14** **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS**

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits comprise cash at hand and short-term deposits
on demand with maturity within three months.

For the purposes of representing the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents are represented by cash as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.

**4.15** **TREASURY SHARES**

Treasury shares bought back are recognised at cost and subtracted from shareholders’ equity. The
purchase, the sale or sale or write-off of treasury shares did not give rise to any profit or loss in
the income statement. The difference between the acquisition value and the consideration, in
case of re-emission, is recognised in the share premium reserve. If options on shares were
exercised in the period, they are satisfied with treasury shares.

**4.16** **PROVISIONS FOR RISKS AND CHARGES**

The Group recognises provisions for risks and charges when:

- it has a legal or implied obligation to third parties, resulting from a past event;

- it is probable that it will become necessary to use the Group’s resources to fulfill the
obligation;

- a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be obtained.

Allocations are recognised at the present value, if the financial element (or time value) is
significantly appreciable, using a discount rate that reflects the specific risks of the liabilities.
When discounting is carried out, the increase in the allocation due to the elapsing of time is
recognised as a financial expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in the income statement of
the period in which the change took place.

**5** **CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES CONTINUED**

The Group applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time. The nature and effect of the changes as a
result of adoption of this new accounting standard is described below.

Several other amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2019, but do not have
an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early
adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet
effective.

F-99


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

**IFRS 16 Leases**

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces the standards IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4
Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and
SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.

IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
lease agreements and requires lessees to account for all lease agreement following a single
accounting model in the financial statements similar to the accounting treatment of financial
leases regulated by IAS 17.

The standard includes two exemptions to recognition for lessees—leases of “low value” assets
(e.g. personal Computers) and short-term lease agreements (i.e. lease agreements with a lease
period shorter than or equal to 12 months). At the starting date of a lease, the lessee shall
recognize a liability relating to lease fees (i.e. the liability for the lease) and an asset that
represents the right to use the underlying asset during the duration of the lease (i.e. the right to
use the asset). Lessee shall separately recognize interest expenses on the liability for the lease
and amortization on the right of use.

Lessees shall also be required to reconsider the amount of the liability relating to the lease upon
occurrence of determined events (e.g., a change of the duration of the lease, a change of the
future fees deriving from the change of an index or of the rate used to determine such
payments). In general, the lessee shall recognize the re-measurement difference of the amount
of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right of use.

The accounting method for the lessor consistent with IFRS 16 remains substantially unchanged
with respect to the current accounting policies according to IAS 17. Lessors shall continue to
classify all leases using the same classification principle of IAS 17 and will distinguish two types of
leases: operating and financial leases.

IFRS 16, which is effective from years beginning from January 1, 2019, requires lessees and lessors
to provide broader disclosure compared to IAS 17.

The Group used the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease agreements for which the
term of the lease agreement expire within 12 months from the date of initial application and the
lease agreements for which the underlying asset has a low value.

The multi-year duration of the agreements required the exercise of a complex professional
judgement by the Corporate Management for the definition of the assumptions to be adopted
for the purposes of determining the impacts connected with the new provisions of the standard.

In particular, the main assumptions adopted regard:

- the assessment of the periods covered by extension or early termination options for the
purposes of the determination of the duration of the lease agreement; the separation of the
non-lease components;

- the assessment of the periods covered by extension or early termination options for the
purposes of the determination of the duration of the lease agreement;

- the discounting rate used for determining the lease liability, represented by the incremental
financing rate of the lessee. This rate was defined taking into account the duration of the lease
agreements, the currency in which they are denominated and the characteristics of the
economic environment in which lessees operate, defined on the basis of the country risk
premium attributed to the individual countries in which the Group operates. At present, the
range of these discount rates is between 4% and 5.6%.

The Group took the option to recognize the effect connected to the retroactive redetermination
of the values in the shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2019, without restating the previous
years provided for comparison (modified retrospective approach).

**IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment**

The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve
uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes. It does not apply to taxes or
levies outside the scope of IAS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest
and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments. The Interpretation specifically addresses
the following:

- Whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately

- The assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation
authorities

- How an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax
credits and tax rates

- How an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances

The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together
with one or more other uncertain tax treatments and uses the approach that better predicts the
resolution of the uncertainty.

The Group applies significant judgement in identifying uncertainties over income tax treatments.
Since the Group operates in a complex multinational environment, it assessed whether the
Interpretation had an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Upon adoption of the Interpretation, the Group considered whether it has any uncertain tax
positions, particularly those relating to transfer pricing. The Company’s and the subsidiaries’ tax
filings in different jurisdictions include deductions related to transfer pricing and the taxation
authorities may challenge those tax treatments. The Group determined, based on its tax
compliance and transfer pricing study, that it is probable that its tax treatments (including those
for the subsidiaries) will be accepted by the taxation authorities. The Interpretation did not have
an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

Under IFRS 9, a debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income, provided that the contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding’ (the SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held
within the appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify
that a financial asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of an event or circumstance that causes
the early termination of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable
compensation for the early termination of the contract. These amendments had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

The amendments to IAS 19 address the accounting when a plan amendment, curtailment or
settlement occurs during a reporting period. The amendments specify that when a plan
amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during the annual reporting period, an entity is
required to determine the current service cost for the remainder of the period after the plan

F-101


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

amendment, curtailment or settlement, using the actuarial assumptions used to remeasure the
net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan
assets after that event. An entity is also required to determine the net interest for the remainder
of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using the net defined benefit
liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that event,
and the discount rate used to remeasure that net defined benefit liability (asset).

The amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it did
not have any plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements during the period.

Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures

The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 to long-term interests in an associate or
joint venture to which the equity method is not applied but that, in substance, form part of the
net investment in the associate or joint venture (long-term interests). This clarification is relevant
because it implies that the expected credit loss model in IFRS 9 applies to such long-term
interests.

The amendments also clarified that, in applying IFRS 9, an entity does not take account of any
losses of the associate or joint venture, or any impairment losses on the net investment,
recognised as adjustments to the net investment in the associate or joint venture that arise from
applying IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements as the Group does
not have long- term interests in its associate and joint venture.

Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle

**IFRS 3 Business Combinations**

The amendments clarify that, when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint
operation, it applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including
remeasuring previously held interests in the assets and liabilities of the joint operation at fair
value. In doing so, the acquirer remeasures its entire previously held interest in the joint
operation.

An entity applies those amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is
on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January
2019, with early application permitted.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as there
is no transaction where joint control is obtained.

**IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements**

An entity that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation might obtain
joint control of the joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a
business as defined in IFRS 3.

The amendments clarify that the previously held interests in that joint operation are not
remeasured.

An entity applies those amendments to transactions in which it obtains joint control on or after
the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with
early application permitted.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as there
is no transaction where a joint control is obtained.

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

**IAS 12 Income Taxes**

The amendments clarify that the income tax consequences of dividends are linked more directly
to past transactions or events that generated distributable profits than to distributions to
owners. Therefore, an entity recognises the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or
loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where it originally recognised those past
transactions or events.

An entity applies the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2019, with early application permitted. When the entity first applies those amendments, it
applies them to the income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning
of the earliest comparative period.

Since the Group’s current practice is in line with these amendments, they had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

**IAS 23 Borrowing Costs**

The amendments clarify that an entity treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing
originally made to develop a qualifying asset when substantially all of the activities necessary to
prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.

The entity applies the amendments to borrowing costs incurred on or after the beginning of the
annual reporting period in which the entity first applies those amendments. An entity applies
those amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early
application permitted.

Since the Group’s current practice is in line with these amendments, they had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

**5.1** **STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE**

The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to
the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends
to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they
become effective.

IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), a comprehensive new
accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement,
presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS
4) that was issued in 2005. IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life,
direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to
certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features.

A few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of IFRS 17 is to provide an accounting
model for insurance contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In contrast to the
requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering previous local accounting
policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for insurance contracts, covering all relevant
accounting aspects. The core of IFRS 17 is the general model, supplemented by:

- A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee
approach)

- A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts

F-103


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

IFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with comparative
figures required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity also applies IFRS 9 and IFRS
15 on or before the date it first applies IFRS 17. This standard is not applicable to the Group.

Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business

In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business
Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a
business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of
whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help
entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business
and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative
examples were provided along with the amendments.

Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after
the date of first application, the Group will not be affected by these amendments on the date of
transition.

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material

In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and
IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to align the definition of
‘material’ across the standards and to clarify certain aspects of the definition. The new definition
states that, ’Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be
expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements
make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a
specific reporting entity.’

The amendments to the definition of material is not expected to have a significant impact on the
Group’s consolidated financial statements.

**6** **DISCRETIONARY VALUATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**

Preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires directors to make discretionary
valuations, estimates and hypotheses that influence the values of revenues, costs, assets and
liabilities and the related disclosure, as well as the indication of potential liabilities. Uncertainty
about assumptions and estimates could lead to outcomes that will require, in the future, a
significant adjustment to the carrying amount of these assets and/or liabilities.

**6.1** **DISCRETIONARY VALUATIONS**

In applying Group accounting standards, the directors made decisions based on the following
discretionary valuations (excluding those entailing estimates) with a significant effect on the
values recorded in the financial statements.

**6.2** **USE OF ESTIMATES**

Illustrated below are the assumptions pertaining to the future and the other main causes of
uncertainty in the estimates that, as at the end of the financial year, present the relevant risk of
giving rise to significant adjustments of the accounting values of the assets and liabilities within
the following year. The Group based its estimates and assumptions on parameters available at
the time of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. However, the current
circumstances and assumptions on future development could be modified because of changes in
the market or of events outside the Group’s control. If these changes take place, they will be
reflected in the assumptions.

**6.2.1 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS**

An impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds
its recoverable value, which is the higher amount between the fair value net of selling costs and
its value in use. Fair value net of selling costs is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset
or of a cash-generating unit in a free transaction between informed and willing parties, minus
the costs of the disposal. The calculation of the value in use is based on a cash flow discounting
model. Cash flows are derived from the budget of the four subsequent years and do not include
restructuring activities for which the Group has not yet committed or significant future
investments that will increase the results of the assets comprising the cash-generating unit being
measured. The recoverable value depends markedly on the discount rate used in the cash flow
discounting model, as well as on cash flows expected in the future and on the growth rate used
for extrapolation.

**6.2.2 ALLOCATION FOR IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACTUAL ASSETS**

The Group uses a matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contractual assets. The
allocation rates are based on the days overdue for each class of customers grouped in the various
segments that have similar historical loss patterns (e.g., by geographic area, type of product, type
of customer, rating and guarantees).

The matrix is initially based on the observed historical insolvency rates of the Group. The Group
will calibrate the matrix to refine the historical data on credit losses with forecast elements.

The assessment of the correlation between the historical insolvency rates, the forecast economic
conditions and the ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECL is sensitive to changes to
circumstances and to the expected economic conditions. The historical experience on the pattern
of the Group’s credit losses and the forecast of future economic conditions may not be
representative of the customer’s actual insolvency in the future.

**6.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA**

The Group’s main liabilities comprise trade receivables, loans and other payables. The main
objective of these liabilities is finance the operational activities of the Group. The Group has
trade and non-trade receivables, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term
deposits that originate directly from the operating activities.

The Group is exposed to market risk (interest and exchange rate risk), to credit risk and to
liquidity risk. Group management is tasked with managing these risks. The Board of Directors
shall review and approve the management policies of each of the risks exposed below.

**6.3.1 INTEREST RATE RISK**

The interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial
instrument will be changed because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to
the risk of changes in market interest rates is related firstly to long-term debt with variable
interest rate.

**6.3.2 EXCHANGE RATE RISK**

The exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of an exposure will
be changed because of changes in exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in
the exchange rates refer mainly to the operating activities of the Group (when the revenue or
costs are denominated in a foreign currency) and to the Group’s net investments in foreign
subsidiaries.

Although the Group has a strong international connotation, use of the Euro as a transnational
currency for most transactions almost entirely eliminates the risk tied to exchange rate changes.

F-105


-----

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

The Group is mainly exposed for positions denominated Euro, Danish Krone, Yen and US Dollar;
however, the volumes are not such as to have any significant impacts on the Group’s financial
and economic results. Consequently, no analysis was carried out on sensitivity to changes in
exchange rates.

**6.3.3 CREDIT RISK**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations tied to a financial
instrument or to a commercial agreement, thus leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed
to the credit risk deriving from its operating activities (mostly for trade receivables and credit
notes) and including deposits with banks and financial institutions.

The credit risk correlated to commercial counterparties is managed by the individual subsidiaries
and monitored centrally by the Group Administrative Office. The Group has no significant credit
risk concentrations. However, procedures are in place to ensure that sales of products and
services are carried out to customers with high reliability, taking into account their financial
position, past experience and other factors. Credit limits on main customers are based on internal
and external valuations on the basis of thresholds approved by the head offices of the individual
countries. Use of credit limits is monitored periodically.

The currently existing customer list comprises the main market players, with maximum reliability
credit ratings. Therefore, no actions to hedge this risk were planned beyond the normal
procedures and checks used for credit risk management.

There are no receivables overdue for over 12 months, unless they are offset by a provision.

**6.3.3.1 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND BANK DEPOSITS**

Concerning the credit risk relating to the management of financial resources and cash, the risk is
monitored by the Group Administrative Office, which implements procedures directed at
ensuring the Group companies have dealings with high, safe profile independent companies.

**6.3.4 LIQUIDITY RISK**

The Group monitors the risk of a lack of liquidity using a liquidity planning tool.

The Group is not significantly exposed to this type of risk because the capital and financial
structure of the Group is sound.

**6.3.5 HEALTH RISKS**

The global outbreak of the coronavirus (“Covid-19”) resulted in a widespread health crisis that
adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, particularly of regions
from which we derive a significant amount of our revenues, including Europe and North
America. Various governments in Europe and North America (including Italy, Spain and the
United States) adopted several measures in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19. We
continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have adopted
several operational measures to react to Covid-19 related issues. For example, we have
implemented health and safety precautions in all locations, plants, offices and shops. In addition,
as a result of the deteriorating conditions due to the spread of the pandemic, on March 16, 2020,
we decided to suspend all production activities in Italy and, thereafter, all retail activities in
Europe and, more recently, both production and retail activities in the United States. If
significant portions of our workforce continue to be unable to work effectively and our facilities
remain closed for a protracted period of time due to government measures, our operations could
be materially impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and some of our
costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.

The continued spread of Covid-19 may also cause disruption in our supply chain and limit the
ability of our customers to perform under their existing contracts, including making timely

payments to us, as well as cause other unpredictable events. In addition, a prolonged general
shutdown of retail operations as a result of the restrictive measures imposed by the government
in Italy and the other countries where we operate, will likely adversely affect employment rates
and consumer spending in the impacted regions, which in turn would adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

Furthermore, the resulting volatility in the global capital markets could restrict our access to
capital and/or increase our cost of capital. We cannot guarantee that Covid-19 or any future
outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease will not have a material adverse effect on
our business and results of operations.

As at the date hereof, it is not possible to predict when the government restrictions in the
countries where we operate will be lifted and when we will be able to open our facilities and
retail locations.

**8.1** **IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL AND ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL**
**LIFE**

In accordance with IAS 36, Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and it is tested for impairment
at least once a year.

For impairment test purposes, Goodwill is allocated to the following Cash Generating Units,
CGUs: Flos, B&B and Louis Poulsen.

The recoverable amount of each CGU (FLOS, B&B and Louis Poulsen) has been determined based
on the calculation of the value in use, in which the projections of the cash flows were those
approved by the management and of a period of 5 years.

The calculation of the value in use is particularly sensitive to the following assumptions:

- revenue trend;

- marginality;

- discount rate;

- growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period.

The discount rate before taxes used for the projections of cash flows is 8% and the cash flows
beyond 5 years have been extrapolated by using a growth rate of 2%.

Upon completion of these analyses, the recoverable amount of the Goodwill was higher than its
book value.

The management has prepared an alternative scenario to verify the effects of this latter on the
assets’ value.

For Flos, the alternative scenario foresaw in 2020 a reduction in revenue of 17.8%, compared to
the final figures for 2019, partially recovered in the following years with a year of delay than the
normal scenario, a margin in 2020 lower of 30% compared to 2019 and investments reduced by
approximately Euro 3.7 Million in 2020. In this scenario, the recoverable value of Goodwill was in
any case higher than the book value.

For B&B, the alternative scenario provided, in 2020, a reduction in revenue of 10.3% compared to
the final figures for 2019, partially recovered in the following years with a year of delay than the
normal scenario, a margin in 2020 of 18.4% lower than 2019 and investments reduced by around
Euro 2.0 Million in 2020 and by Euro 2.4 million in 2021, partially recovered in subsequent years.
In this scenario, the recoverable value of Goodwill was equal to the book value.

For Louis Poulsen, the alternative scenario envisaged, in 2020, a reduction in revenue of 13.7%
compared to the final figures for 2019, a margin in 2020 of 19.5% lower than 2019 and reduced
investments of about Euro 2.0 Million in 2020. In this scenario, the recoverable value of Goodwill
was in any case higher than the book value.

**_Development costs, totalling Euro 8.956 thousand, includes the costs for the personnel dedicated_**
to product development work carried out within the Group. These costs are amortised in three
years.

**_Industrial patent and intellectual property rights comprises mainly costs incurred for depositing_**
patents, producing software and build e-commerce websites.

**_Concessions, licences and trademarks and other intangible assets comprises mainly assets of the_**
Parent Company referred to the production licences relating to specific product lines, costs for
software licenses, costs for projects in progress and customer relationships.

**_Trademark, amounting to Euro 568.787 thousand, refers to the trademarks:_**

- “FLOS”, equal to Euro 244.139;

- “B&B”, “Maxalto” and “Arclinea” equal to Euro 200.746 thousand;

- “Louis Poulsen”, equal to Euro 123.313.

Trademarks are considered with an indefinite useful life and therefore subject to annual
impairment test.

The recoverable amount of the trademarks has been verified by determining a royalty rate,
which a third party would be willing to pay to the owners of the brands, applied to the forecast
revenue provided by the business plan. Using a discount rate of 8%, the recoverable value of
trademarks was higher than the book value.

The management has prepared an alternative scenario, as made for the impairment of Goodwill,
to verify the effects of this scenario on the value of trademarks.

Potential impairments of a non-significant amount (about 1% of the total) emerged from this
test.

The value of the Land and Buildings increased compared to the previous year mainly due to the
extraordinary maintenance works carried out on Group’s showrooms and stores, in Italy and
Norway.

The variation in Industrial and Commercial Equipment refers to purchases of new molds for the
development and manufacture of products.

**11** **RIGHT OF USE AND FINANCIAL LEASE LIABILITIES**

The Group has existing leases covering land and buildings, plants and machinery, vehicles and
other equipment that are used in operational activities. Land and construction leases generally
last between 2 and 24 years, plant and machinery leases generally last between 2 and 8 years,
while those for vehicles and other equipment generally last between 2 and 5 years.

The group’s liabilities relating to these leasing agreements are guaranteed by the title of the
landlord’s property on the leased assets. Generally, the Group may not in turn lease the leased
assets to third parties and certain contracts require the group to comply with certain liquidity
indices. There are many leasing agreements that include options for renewal and cancellation
and variable payments that are best described below.

The group also has certain leases for machinery whose lifespan is 12 months or less and office
equipment whose value is modest. The group has chosen for these contracts to apply the
exemptions provided by IFRS16 for short-term or low value assets. We point out that, in total, in
2019, the costs recorded in the economic account for short-term leases amounted to Eur
459 thousand.

The measurement of the employee severance indemnity for IAS purposes follows the method of
the projection of the present value of the defined benefits obligation with the estimate of the
benefits accrued by employees.

Following the changes introduced by Law no. 296 of December 27, 2006 (“2007 Budget Act”) and
by the following implementing Decrees and Regulations, the portions of employee severance
indemnity accrued until December 31, 2006 will continue to remain in the company configuring a
defined benefits plan (obligation for the accrued benefits subject to actuarial valuation), while
the portions accruing from January 1, 2007 onwards, by effect of the choices made by the
employees during the year, will be allocated to complementary pension plans or transferred by
the company to the treasury provision managed by INPS and starting from the time the decision
is formalised by the employee, they are defined contribution plans (no longer subject to actuarial
valuation). Hence, the employee severance indemnity is determined as a result of the application
of an actuarial model based on several demographic and economic assumptions.

The following table shows the technical economic assumptions used:

obtained, consistently with Paragraph 83 of IAS 19, from the Iboxx Corporate AA index recorded
on the date of the measurement. For this purpose, the return whose duration is comparable to
the collective duration of the evaluated Company was selected.

Since February, the spread of the Covid-19 virus has caused a marked slowdown in the economies
of Asian countries and, subsequently, its worldwide spread is causing global human and
economic impacts.

Our primary concern has been the safety and health of our employees, we have taken all the
necessary measures, including extraordinary ones, aimed at mitigating health risks and ensuring
business continuity, complying, in various geographies, with the measures introduced by the
various national authorities. The worsening situation led us to the decision to suspend on March
16[th], 2020, the production activities in Italy and subsequently the European retail activities were
also suspended and, lastly, the retail and production activities in the USA. Louis Poulsen has
always remained in operation in Denmark, while adopting all the social distancing and remote
working measures to minimize the health risk for employees.

At the time of the approval of these financial statements, the picture of uncertainty about the
evolution of the situation remains. Now, the unavoidable negative effects of the epidemic on the
outlet markets and on our activity are difficult to quantify. However, the Company has set up a
sensitivity scenario assuming a slowdown in revenues attributable to the health emergency in
2020 and 2021 and has instructed the Accuracy company to use this scenario for further and more
severe stress of the impairment test.

This further sensitivity confirmed the holding of the start-up balance sheet, while with reference
to the brands reported a potential impairment total of about 1.1% at the consolidated level.

The CEO considers that, taking into account the extreme caution expected in this sensitivity,
there has been no need to change the values recorded in the Company’s balance sheet as of
December 31, 2019.

As known, the Company, as an original borrower and original guarantor and, inter alios,
UniCredit S.p.A., as an agent and security agent, they both signed, on November 9, 2018, a super
senior revolving financing agreement (as amended as of 22 November 2019) under which the
relevant financing banks have made available to the Company a super senior revolving line of
credit of the original amount of Euro 100,000,000.00. During the 2020 financial year, the
Company required the financing banks to proceed with the provision of this financing for the full
amount, in order to find the necessary financial resources to be able to support its own working
capital needs and of the group to which it is responsible, also considering the current state of
emergency on the national territory arising from the health risk associated with the spread of the
so-called “COVID-19” and considering the legislative measures taken by the Italian Government
to deal with the current state of emergency on the national territory with the Decree Act of
February 23, 2020 and following implementation measures, including the DPCM March 11, 2020.

Please note that IDG and its related companies may, at any time and, from time to time, purchase
or buy back and possibly cancel the bonds issued by IDG through market transactions, privately
traded transactions, takeover offers or in other ways. These bond purchases, if made, will take
place at the prices and conditions that the relevant purchaser will determine considering the
market conditions existing at that time.

The Group is therefore able to meet its financial commitments and pursue the objectives of the
business plan.

The Management verified that the fair value of cash and cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, of trade receivables and payables, of bank overdrafts and of other current
liabilities approximates the book value as a result of the short-term maturities of these
instruments.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is reported in the amount for which the
instrument could be traded in a current transaction between willing parties, instead of in a
forced sale or in a liquidation. To estimate fair value, the following methods and the following
assumptions were used:

- Long-term receivables and loans, both fixed rate and floating rate, are measured by the Group
on the basis of parameters such as interest rates, specific risk factors for each Country, the
individual credit rating of each customer and the characteristic risk of the financial project.

Consolidated financial statements of Design International Design Group S.p.A. at December 31, 2019

Based on this measurement, the allocations for the expected losses on these receivables are
recognised in the accounting records.

- The fair value of listed securities and bonds is based on the listed price at the date of the
financial statements. The fair value of unlisted instruments, such as loans from banks or other
financial liabilities, obligations deriving from financial leases or as other non-current financial
liabilities, is estimated through discounted future cash flows applying the current rates
available for payables with similar terms, such as the credit risk and the remaining maturities.
In addition to being sensitive to reasonably possible changes of the expected cash flows or of
the discount rate, the fair value of equity instruments is also sensitive to reasonably possible
changes of the growth rates. The valuation requires the use, by the Management of non
observable input data, illustrated previously. The Management regularly defines a range of
reasonably possible alternatives for these significant non observable input data and it
determines their impact on total fair value.

The present Financial Statements, consisting of the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of
Profit/Loss for the Year, Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in
Equity, Statement of Cash Flows and Explanatory Notes, provide a true and fair representation of
the financial position and the income for the year and match the results of the accounting
records.
