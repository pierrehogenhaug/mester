The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and as of the Issue Date its only material assets will be its holding of the entire issued share capital of Gym Topco Limited (“Topco”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Topco Group”), including Fitness World (as defined below) (the Issuer, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and together with Fitness World collectively, the “Combined Group”), as well as rights and claims under intercompany financings. The Issuer’s only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Notes, the Notes and certain subordinated shareholder debt. For further information, please see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Business” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. The Issuer acquired Topco on November 30, 2017 (the “2017 Acquisition Date”) and the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements (as defined below) encompass the 14-month period of trading from the 2017 Acquisition Date to December 31, 2018. As a result, the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements are not directly comparable to the 2017 Topco Financial Statements or the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements (each as defined below), both of which were prepared on a 12-month basis. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, this Offering Memorandum provides the 2018 Topco Financial Statements (as defined below) for comparative purposes rather than the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements. The 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements have been included in the F-pages to this Offering Memorandum for reference purposes only. The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes: - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Topco Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), including the related notes thereto (the “2017 Topco Financial Statements”); - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Topco Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (with unaudited comparative financial information as at and for the year ended December 31, 2017) and prepared in accordance with IFRS, including the related notes thereto (the “2018 Topco Financial Statements”); - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the 14-month period from the 2017 Acquisition Date to December 31, 2018 which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in accordance with IFRS, including the related notes thereto (the “2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements”); - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in accordance with IFRS, including the related notes thereto (the “2019 Pure Gym Financial",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

In this Offering Memorandum, we present financial and other operating data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to its usefulness as regards our historical performance, this data represents the ordinary course operations of our business before the Acquisition and before the impact of COVID-19. We have also presented viii ----- financial and other operating data as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which include the results of the Fitness World Group from January 14, 2020 and which represent the impact on our business of the Acquisition and COVID-19. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Pure Gym Financial Statements. With respect to the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements, Pure Gym applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method, for transition and measuring right of use assets using the retrospective calculation, both as defined by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. Cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were therefore recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. The 2017 Topco Financial Statements and the 2018 Topco Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognizes a right-ofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or Pure Gym EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. See Note 27 “Change in Accounting Policies” of the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements. The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), as applied to Pure Gym. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile Pure Gym’s IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The Indenture will impose no obligation on us to reconcile our future financial statements prepared under IFRS to U.S. GAAP. See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditor’s reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP state that the reports including the opinions were prepared for and only for Pure Gym’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other purpose; the independent auditors did not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by their prior consent in writing. Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditor has confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to Pure Gym and its members as a body, with respect to the report and to the independent auditor’s audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

This Offering Memorandum provides selected historical financial information from the 2017 Fitness World Financial Statements (as defined below) for comparative purposes and in order to demonstrate growth trends for key Fitness World metrics. Comparative figures for 2018 are provided due to the final valuation of acquired identifiable net assets being completed in 2019 for the acquisitions made in 2018, leading to adjustments to previously reported fair values for Basefit.

We define the following Non-IFRS Measures as follows: - “Adjusted EBITDA” as the profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization of intangible fixed assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, exceptional administrative expenses, and other extraordinary items, after adding back Pre-Opening Costs, share based payment charges and the Cash Rent Adjustment. - **“Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by revenue for that period. - “As adjusted Net Debt” represents total senior secured indebtedness of the Combined Group less cash and cash equivalents, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the application of the proceeds therefrom and the Equity Injection as if the Transactions and the Equity Injection had occurred on December 31, 2019. - “As adjusted Net Interest Expense” represents the net of interest payable/receivable for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2019. - “Average Continuous Membership Tenure” as the average monthly tenure of all active and paying members, including members who have frozen their membership, as of a given point in time. This includes previous memberships where the gap in membership was 30 days or less, but excludes the period(s) of non-membership. - “Average Gym ROCE” as Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant portfolio of gyms for that period divided by the Initial Capital Investment attributable to that portfolio of gyms. - “Average Initial Capital Investment for Mature Gyms” as the Initial Capital Investment for all Mature Gyms for a certain period divided by the number of Mature Gyms in that period. - “Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain period divided by the number of Mature Gyms in that period. - “Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain period divided by the revenue attributable to Mature Gyms for that period. - “Average Mature Gym ROCE” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain portfolio of gyms for a certain period divided by the Initial Capital Investment attributable to that portfolio of gyms. - “Average Revenue per Member per Month” as revenue for that period divided by the number of months in that period and further divided by the average number of members during that period. The average number of members during that period is calculated as the average of the number of members as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in that period. - “Cash Rent Adjustment” from January 1, 2019, as the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA (as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). Pre January 1, 2019, under IAS17, the total rent payable over the life of the lease is spread over the lease term and charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in arriving at EBITDA. As we typically receive a rent free period of a year or more as an incentive from developers or landlords to lease space in their buildings this results in rent charged to EBITDA being greater than the cash outlay in the early years of the lease term and less than the cash outlay in the later years of the lease term. The Cash Rent Adjustment xi ----- adds back any non-cash element of the rent expensed in the period during these early years (less any amounts already added back as a Pre-Opening Cost) and deducts any shortfall in rent expense in the later years to reflect the actual cash outlay due for that period under our lease arrangements. Management believes that adjusting EBITDA to reflect cash rent is a better reflection of our actual earnings. - “Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA of Pure Gym plus Adjusted EBITDA of Fitness World. - _“Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Combined Group Adjusted EBITDA for a certain period divided by the Combined Group Revenue. - “Combined Group EBITDA” as EBITDA of Pure Gym plus EBITDA of Fitness World. - “Combined Group Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA” Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA of Pure Gym plus Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA of Fitness World. - “Combined Group Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA margin” Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA of Pure Gym plus Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA of Fitness World for a certain period, divided by the Combined Group Revenue. - **“Combined Group Operating Cash Flow” as Operating Cash Flow of Pure Gym plus Operating Cash Flow of Fitness World. - “Combined Group Revenue” as revenue of Pure Gym plus revenue of Fitness World. - “Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of Pure Gym plus Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of Fitness World. - “EBITDA” as the profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization of intangible fixed assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications and exceptional administrative expenses. - “Expansionary Capital Expenditure” as the Initial Capital Investment and the capital costs of expanding gym sites incurred in that period. - “Gym cohorts” as groups of Pure Gym or Fitness World clubs, as applicable, that opened during a specified period. - **“Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA for that period, excluding Head Office Costs. - **“Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for that period. - “Head Office Costs” as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization, related to the operation of head office functions in a given period. - “Initial Capital Investment” refers to the capital cost of bringing a new gym into operation or extending a gym, including expenditures on site fit out, fixtures, fittings and equipment and excluding the cost of any right of use property assets, ongoing maintenance and refurbishment capex. - “Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditures” as the total capital expenditure incurred in a period less Expansionary Capital Expenditure incurred in that period. - “Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA” as profit for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization of intangible xii ----- fixed assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications and exceptional administrative expenses for mature sites, after adding back the Cash Rent Adjustment and Pre-Opening Costs for mature sites and after adding back Head Office Costs. - “Mature Gym EBITDA” as profit for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization of intangible fixed assets, impairment of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, exceptional administrative expenses and Head Office Costs for Mature Gyms.

We present a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its limitations. For a reconciliation of these Non-IFRS Measures and such discussions, refer to “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other financial, operational _and pro forma data”._ We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. In addition, EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “RunRate Adjusted EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include: xiii ----- - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Key performance indicators and the other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable with the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

We believe that the Combined Group has strong growth prospects and common core competencies, including shared market leadership positions in the UK and Denmark, an inclusive philosophy, a modern technology-enabled customer offer based on high-quality, affordable gyms that can be accessed on a flexible basis, and a strong platform for expansion. Our vision is to provide affordable, flexible, and “value-for-money” memberships to high-quality gyms to all people who want to increase their level of fitness, as demonstrated by our inclusive “everybody welcome” philosophy. In response to COVID-19, governments globally (including within the markets in which we operate) have implemented strict social distancing measures, including varied approaches to lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including ours. COVID-19 presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our industry. We are taking appropriate actions in response to COVID-19 in line with relevant government guidance and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage our business, control our cost base and protect our operating cash flows. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of COVID-19”. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the short-, medium- or long-term impacts of COVID-19 on our business and our industry. Our strategic mission continues to be providing affordable and flexible memberships to high-quality fitness facilities balanced against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. Upon our acquisition of Fitness World, we were the market-leading operator in the Danish market, with a growing presence in Switzerland and amongst value operators in Europe, were number two by number of sites value operator in Europe and number three by revenue and member numbers. We believe that the strategic rationale for the acquisition of Fitness World remains intact for the long-term despite the significant immediate challenges faced in a COVID-19 world. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived 57% of our revenue from our operations in the UK, 36% from our operations in Denmark, 6% from operations in Switzerland and 1% from our operations in Poland. Our key geographic markets are the UK and Denmark and as such, Pure Gym and Fitness World will continue operating under their existing brand names in these key markets. As of December 31, 2019, the Combined Group operated 504 gyms in cities and towns across the four countries, with Pure Gym accounting for 52% of clubs and Fitness World accounting for 48% of clubs, and had approximately 1.7 million members in total. The table below displays the key European gym operators by number of members: 1 ----- (‘000 Members) (1) Source: Company information and Deloitte/EuropeActive Report.

(3) Pure Gym, Fitness World and The Gym Group data is as of December 2019; Basic-Fit data is as of Q3 2019. Members of other operators are as per latest estimates included in the Deloitte/EuropeActive Report. Fitness World is a good strategic fit for Pure Gym due to its aligned low-cost operating model. The Combined Group is the third largest operator in Europe by membership and the second largest by number of gyms. With leading market positions in the UK and Denmark and as the second largest player in Switzerland, the Combined Group is a market-leading European value gym operator with diversification and scale benefits. Our disruptive customer value proposition, differentiated business model and well-managed growth strategy has allowed us to grow rapidly. For the year ended December 2019, the Combined Group generated revenue of £447.5 million and a Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of £161.2 million after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisition.

211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.1,Attractive and resilient fitness market driven by established trends towards the value segment,"Pure Gym and Fitness World operate in an attractive and growing market within which the value segment is growing. The European health and fitness club market had a market value of £21.9 billion as of December 2019 (Source: OC&C Report) and fitness club memberships continue to increase across most of the European geographies. Over the four years from December 2015 to December 2019, members of the European fitness market increased from 54 million to 65 million, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% (Source: OC&C Report). In the UK, the health and fitness club market continues to benefit from the UK population becoming more health-conscious and from various government initiatives designed to promote healthy living and active lifestyles. The UK health market has also benefitted from the increasing prevalence of value gyms, which have increased the availability of fitness facilities to a larger proportion of the population. The value gym market share increased from 7% to 13% over the past four years between December 2015 and December 2019, as a percentage of total market value (Source: LDC Report, OC&C Report). 3 ----- Historically, the UK health and fitness market has been served by mid-market and premium private gym operators and by public gym operators. While the value gym segment has grown quickly over the past several years, we believe there remains significant opportunity for further growth due to value gyms’ broad consumer appeal. Currently, 16% of the United Kingdom population is a member of a gym, which is below equivalent penetration rates in Sweden (22%), Norway (21%) and the U.S. (20%) (Source: OC&C Report). There remains room for growth in gym market penetration in Denmark and Switzerland, with only 19% of the Danish population and 14% of the Swiss population having a gym membership. In Denmark, market share of the value segment increased from 45% to 56% over the past four years between 2015 and 2019, as a percentage of total market value. The high market share of value gyms is mainly driven by the clear leadership position of Fitness World in Denmark. The value gym market has demonstrated resilience during periods of economic decline and can also support growth in these conditions as consumers consider cost-conscious alternatives. Consumer spending on gyms has shown resilience during periods of decreased overall economic activity, as demonstrated by a 2.1% CAGR in total gym spend in the UK health and fitness club market between 2006 and 2012, during which period total gym spend did not fall during any individual year. From 2008 to 2012, value gyms grew significantly, with membership increasing by a CAGR of 12.1% (Source: LDC Report, OC&C Report). Throughout 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to our everyday way of life and to our industry. Only those operators with the strong liquidity positions have been able to withstand a period of extended closure and therefore we anticipate some supply will exit the market as weaker operators fail. We believe demand will continue to be strong given the increased focus on health and well-being post COVID-19. We continue to believe we have the right business model, operating in the right market segment to be highly successful in a postCOVID-19 environment in the medium to long term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Our scale and market leading position provide us with significant competitive advantages, including: _Commercial Offer—Our leading footprint of 263 gyms in the UK and 185 gyms in Denmark as of December_ 31, 2019 enables us to offer our members multi-site access in many locations. In addition, our scale enables us to pursue partnerships and other commercial arrangements that further differentiate our product offering and value proposition. _Property Acquisition—We have historically had a strong landlord covenant rating and have benefitted from_ “tenant of choice” status given our scale, strong brand and high quality product. As a result, we are generally able to secure our selected sites on attractive lease terms throughout the UK and Denmark. _Technology—We have invested heavily in building out our digital presence and software engineering teams_ and third-party technology relationships. As a result, we have a high and increasing degree of control over, and the ability to improve, our web, mobile and application-based offerings. We believe this will help reduce costs and increase revenues over time, particularly following the integration of technological systems between Pure Gym and Fitness World. Key features of our technology include: - Website and dedicated apps that, among other things, provide members the ability to enrol and upgrade into the various membership packages, utilize nutrition and exercise guides, view workout videos, find and book classes, see how busy their gym is, track their gym activity, follow workout plans and track body composition metrics. - Superior technology-enabled systems within individual gyms, including automatic PIN-based gym entry systems at all Pure Gyms, access card gym entry at all Fitness World clubs and “intelligent cycling” at certain Fitness World sites. 4 ----- _Brand—The Combined Group has national brands that benefit from higher levels of brand awareness than_ any other value gym operator in the UK and Denmark. The scale and nationwide footprint allow the business to effectively pursue national marketing campaigns such as TV advertisements. In the UK, the Pure Gym brand is also supplemented by a workout video YouTube channel with over 16,000 subscribers and an Instagram account with over 110,000 followers as of February 2020. In Denmark, Fitness World’s presence is supplemented by 32,300 followers on its Instagram account as of February 2020. Fitness World also uses its dedicated app to advertise services and products such as personal training and sports nutrition drinks from its Functional Nutrition line, which grows the brand and drives value added sales. _Ability to invest—Our scale and resources allow us to rapidly develop new sites and invest in other areas of_ our business, such as technology, that enable us to operate more efficiently and deliver a better customer experience. Our reinvestment and refurbishment capability further differentiates us from smaller cashconstrained competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.3,Diversified operator with scale that is difficult to replicate,"We have become a market-leading value gym operator in the UK and Danish markets, with a growing presence in Switzerland. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the outperformance in the countries in which we operate, including for the following reasons: - _Increasing scale and a healthy degree of geographic diversification—Upon its acquisition of Fitness World, the newly Combined Group was number two in Europe by number of gyms with over 500 sites (517 sites as of November 9, 2020, consisting of 253 open sites, 236 closed sites in England, six closed sites in Denmark, three closed sites in Switzerland and 19 closed sites in Poland due to COVID-19 restrictions) and had a Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of £161.2 million as of December 31, 2019 (on a _pro forma basis). We are geographically diversified with 43% of Combined Group revenue generated from operations outside of the UK. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated £255 million in UK revenue, £160 million in Danish revenue, £27 million in Swiss revenue and £5 million in Polish revenue. We have the largest gym estate and membership base in the UK market with 11% of total UK gym members and we are a leader in Danish fitness industry with an estimated 43% market share. We believe our expansive presence allows us to procure services and products on favourable terms due to the larger volume of our operations, which gives us superior purchasing power compared to smaller gym operators or new entrants into the market. - _High barriers to scale—We believe that new fitness brands would experience extreme difficulty in attempting to disrupt our strong presence and overall member loyalty, particularly in the UK and in Denmark. We are present in some of the most attractive locations, making it difficult for new entrants to open competing clubs given our accumulated expertise for identifying gym sites. We also have a diversified network of gyms which allows us to offer multi-site membership more effectively. Key features of our business that new entrants would have difficulty in scaling include: - _Expertise in property management—Given our established operating track record and position as the value gym industry leader in the UK and Denmark with national scale, we have acquired significant expertise in property acquisition and management. We are skilled at identifying site locations that will be successful and provide strong ROCE. In order to maintain our market-leading position, we have a strong site selection and property development team with industry expertise supported by an external team of professionals, such as lawyers, architects and planning consultants, as well as the technological tools at our disposal. In particular, we utilize a quantitative whitespace tool to identify attractive new locations in all geographies. The whitespace tool takes into account population statistics, drive time, local demographics, commercial space in catchment area, office locations data, competitor locations and infrastructure (for example, proximity to train stations) when analysing potential new sites. The whitespace tool both identifies attractive cities as well as optimal locations for rollout within a city. 5 ----- - _Industry leading technology platform—We continue to invest in our technology platform, consisting of both websites and mobile applications, where our members can book classes, pay for their memberships and other ancillary services. As the fitness industry increasingly converges with the digital sector, we believe that our technology platform allows our members to more easily access and purchase our services, which helps us attract and retain members. Additionally, our technology-enabled platform allows us to analyse user-specific data which in turn, supports our operational performance. This allows our management to better control all aspects of our pricing strategy, product development and promotional activities. Pure Gym and Fitness World have independently invested in their technological platforms and the Combined Group will benefit from the combination of IT capabilities across its operations as these systems converge. - _Leading marketing expertise driving strong brand awareness—We have an increasingly sophisticated, multi-channel digital-led marketing strategy which is not overly reliant on any single channel. We employ a range of marketing techniques through various media channels in order to promote a contemporary and differentiated brand, which would be difficult for new entrants to replicate given our resources and prior marketing experience. - _Superior convenience as a result of network scale—We have the largest gym network in the UK and Denmark, which allows us to capitalize on potential members’ desire for proximity. We believe this to be a competitive advantage, given that research indicates that proximity is among the top two most important factors for members when choosing a gym. - _Greater access to capital allowing for rapid growth—Based on our strong operating cash flow conversion, which is driven by our highly efficient and high-margin operating model, comparatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements and positive working capital inflows, we are able to continue investing in new and existing sites. This allows us to protect and grow our market share, while we observe that some mid-market gym operators are often choosing not to reinvest in their existing sites or in expansion. - _Pricing sophistication—We have the ability to employ dynamic pricing at certain gyms in order to tailor our price points to the local market. This allows us to adapt to local markets by managing member enrolment and thus optimize revenues. - _Purchasing Scale—We believe we are the largest purchaser of gym equipment in our key geographies from leading suppliers including Matrix, Precor and Technogym, thereby reducing the costs of constructing and operating our gyms. - _Highly experienced team with significant industry know-how—Our team has exceptional local knowledge, which is based on strong relationships that they have developed over time. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments in our management team comprised of experienced professionals with established track records.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.4,Powerful and highly disruptive customer value proposition,"We believe that our customer value proposition, which is focused on providing affordable and flexible memberships to high-quality fitness facilities, is powerful and highly disruptive to the traditional gym and fitness industry. The strength of our customer value proposition has enabled us to grow rapidly by gaining significant market share from traditional mid-market and premium operators, as well as attracting consumers to our gyms who have never previously been a member of a fitness club. The key characteristics of Pure Gym’s customer proposition are as follows: _High-quality facilities and inclusive philosophy—Our gyms are equipped with a large number of pieces of_ high-specification gym equipment, including a broad selection of cardio machines, fixed resistance machines, free weights and functional and other exercise equipment, such as TRX bands and kettlebells. Our gyms are clean, well-maintained and are fitted out with high-quality changing rooms and shower facilities and audio/visual systems. We have welcoming environments and we seek to support all members in the pursuit of their fitness goals, regardless of their current abilities, as demonstrated by our 6 ----- “everybody welcome” philosophy in Pure Gyms and “create healthy habits for all” philosophy in Fitness World clubs. _Affordable pricing—Our flexible and low-cost membership structure provides excellent value for money for_ our members, with student discounts and day passes at Pure Gym locations and off-peak membership options. These options further minimize costs at Pure Gyms and Fitness World clubs, often enabling access to affordable fitness where there previously was none. _Flexibility—We offer a great range of flexibility through our enrolment offers, free classes, extended opening_ hours, premium membership options, and online membership management. - _Enrolment—Members can sign up with no fixed term contract in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland. Accordingly, members have the freedom and the flexibility to leave at their convenience without incurring cancellation fees and have the ability to freeze their memberships for months at a time. - _Access—We generally offer 24x7x365 access in the UK and extended opening hours in Denmark. This contrasts with the opening hours of mid-market and premium operators, which tend to be more restricted. Clubs in Switzerland are open for 14 to 17 hours a day during weekdays with more limited weekend hours depending on each club. - _Free classes—We have dedicated group exercise studios, including purpose-built stationary cycling studios in many locations. Most Pure Gym clubs offer over 50 free classes per week taught by professional personal trainers. Fitness World incorporates a wide range of class offerings in their membership model. Other operators in the value market do not typically offer such an extensive range of classes. - _Premium Memberships—For an additional monthly premium, our members can choose to upgrade their enrolment options, which provides them with a number of additional benefits. For example, they may have the ability to book classes earlier than standard members, guest passes and larger discounts on sports and fitness brands or receive a set number of personal training sessions a year. - _Online Membership Management—Our online website and app platforms allow members to manage their membership online, freeze or cancel their membership, book classes, locate gym facilities, track fitness data and engage in fitness challenges.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.5,High cash flow generative profile underpinned by exceptional profitability and positive working capital cash inflows,"We believe that we have a low cost, capital efficient and technology-enabled gym operating model that provides a competitive advantage over mid-market and premium gym operators. The operating model allows us to offer a compelling customer proposition, support high levels of membership and require low levels of operating and Initial Capital Investment costs. Collectively, these factors drive strong unit economics and ROCEs. The key characteristics of the model are as follows: _Highly capital efficient—Greenfield gyms require a known level of maintenance and refurbishment capital_ expenditure post initial pre-opening investments relating to leasehold costs and fit-out. Landlords will often contribute to the initial fit-out of clubs and in Denmark, these landlord contributions are often significant. Gyms generate stable and predictable EBITDA at maturity (24-36 months post opening), driving attractive ROCE. _Low personnel costs—We are able to operate our gyms with low levels of employed personnel primarily_ through the use of technology. For example, Pure Gym uses an online joining process and Fitness World offers in-app enrolment, both of which eliminate the need for a dedicated in-gym sales forces which are commonly used by mid-market and premium operators. Members at Pure Gym and Fitness World locations also use fully-automated PIN-controlled entry portals or member cards to facilitate secure 7 ----- access to gyms, which eliminates the need for additional staff. We believe that we can build upon existing commonalities between Pure Gym and Fitness World and further increase personnel cost efficiency by applying some UK best practices to Fitness World gyms through measures such as unmanned hours covered by video surveillance with tailored alert systems. _Highly effective utilization of space—Unlike most mid-market and premium operators, we do not install_ pools, spas, saunas, steam room, extensive cafes or other high-end amenities in our gyms. These amenities are generally expensive to construct, operate and maintain and take up a significant amount of leased space. We believe that these amenities are generally less utilized by members and that by eliminating them we are able to install a greater number of pieces of high utilization fitness equipment, such as treadmills, free weights and stationary bikes. As a result, our gyms in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland can support high levels of membership while operating on low operating and Initial Capital Investment costs. In addition to consistent and predictable growth, we have strong overall gym performance in the countries in which we operate. For our UK operations, revenue increased from £159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 16.8%. Similarly, Pure Gym Run-Rate Adjusted increased from £69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 14.5%. For the acquired Fitness World, revenue increased from £121.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 16.6%. Fitness World Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA increased from £28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 22.3%. The Combined Group benefits from a highly cash generative business model, which is driven by manageable maintenance capital expenditure requirements and positive working capital inflows. The working capital dynamics are underpinned by rent free periods for new leases, favourable terms with our primary gym equipment providers, and payments from members being received in advance, while major suppliers are paid in arrears. Following the historical period of investment, there is limited further expenditure required in central functions (for example, a head office), which helps to ensure that we are a fully scalable platform going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.6,Highly experienced executive leadership team,"Our senior management has an established track record of delivering growth and operational excellence in their current roles at the company and in their prior roles at a range of other businesses. Senior management is supported by an experienced management team in key areas, including property acquisition, property development, operations, IT, marketing, human resources and finance. The experienced management team from Fitness World has proven capabilities to drive growth across multiple geographies. The individuals that form part of our property acquisition and development teams are highly experienced in the markets in which we operate. They have strong relationships with landlords, agents, developers and contractors and a proven ability to identify and develop a large number of successful sites while promoting consistent growth as evidenced by our estate growth. We believe that the strength and experience of the property acquisition and development teams ensures that we are well placed to secure attractive new gym sites. Under the current CEO, Pure Gym has grown from an operator of 84 gyms with £37 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to an operator of over 500 gyms with £161.2 million of Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 (on a pro forma basis). In addition to a strong track record of operational excellence and property acquisition expertise, our leadership team also adheres to a balanced fiscal policy of deleveraging. Pure Gym has consistently reduced its leverage over the past three years. In November 2017, Pure Gym had a leverage ratio of 4.6x (calculated as senior secured net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA). As of December 2018, this reduced to 3.9x and as of December 2019, the leverage ratio was further reduced to 3.6x, demonstrating a consistent organic deleveraging profile. Further, we have a clear deleveraging strategy for the future as we intend to: - deploy new equity capital in a considered and measured way to open new sites, improve existing sites and deliver technology assets; - reduce leverage by growing EBITDA through new site openings and deployment of technology assets in our core business and through capital-light franchising growth; and 8 ----- - balance capital deployment with cashflow generation and progressive deleveraging. Pure Gym has made substantial investments in management over the past two years and important business functions are now generally managed internally, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. For example, important IT functions were brought in-house in 2015 and the IT team was strengthened with a number of new hires. The senior management team is comprised of high calibre individuals with broad experience from various sectors and previous businesses. This ensures that our senior management and other important management teams are well invested and are capable of executing both our focus on performance delivery and our growth strategy. We have a strong and differentiated culture centred on collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship and we believe that this culture has been a key driver of our ability to deliver strong historical growth and widen the gap between us and other operators in the value gym market. This culture has also helped us to attract and retain high quality personnel and create a highly motivated work force that is dedicated to delivering the best product possible. Pure Gym is recognized as an “employer of choice” after being placed in the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2018 (the results of which are based on employee feedback).",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.1,A rigorous focus on operational excellence to drive the growth and profitability of our existing estate,"We remain focused on maintaining the high-quality performance of all our gyms and delivering profitable growth across our existing estate. Management drives revenue performance in a number of ways, including: _Maintaining high standards through targeted investments—We are focused on carefully investing in our_ existing estate in order to maintain the high-quality of our gyms and we seek to continuously optimize the product offer and member experience. This in turn supports our ability to drive membership volumes and tenures, word of mouth recommendations and provide value for money for our members. _Driving Average Revenue Per Member (“ARPM”)—We take a multi-layered approach to increasing ARPM_ by: - _Developing new commercial products—We have implemented and continue to develop new membership options to attract certain types of new members to our gyms and increase our fee yields while consistently offering excellent value for money. For example, Pure Gym has continued to see an increase in penetration of its premium membership products across its gyms. These products take advantage of our technology platform to offer members the option to pre-book classes on a priority basis, take a friend to the gym, obtain multi-site access and freeze their memberships. Similarly, Fitness World offers premium membership options for members who are interested in sports nutritional products or a set number of personal training sessions per year. - _Increasing ancillary sales per visit—Ancillary sales are an integral part of the initiative to increase ARPM. For example, Fitness World has successfully grown ancillary sales through its personal training programs and through developing its own successful brand of nutritional supplements by: - educating over 300 new personal trainers and over 400 new instructors through their Fitness Institute and Fitness World Academy; and - offering nutritional products ranging from sports and energy drinks, protein bars and protein powder for purchase through its on-site vending machines, at reception, or through 9 ----- membership options, such as Fitness World’s “All In” membership in its Denmark clubs, which entitles members to one nutritional product per day. - _Bringing the UK’s variable pricing expertise to Fitness World markets—Fitness World does not currently offer dynamic pricing in the same way that Pure Gym can in the UK. It is believed that there are potential upsides to bringing Pure Gym’s pricing expertise for setting membership fees specific to local markets Denmark and Switzerland. Our operational experts tailor pricing to specific local markets and monitor and change the specific prices over time as the market and our competition evolve. In turn, this allows us to monitor member enrolment, manage capacity and maximize revenue and returns. - _Optimizing site capacity—We seek to optimize the capacity of our existing gyms where this is possible and viable. Capacity optimization can involve the physical extension of gyms, or the redesign of certain aspects of gyms to eliminate site-specific utilization bottlenecks, such as the substitution of low utilization equipment, or the installation of additional automated entry portals or access gates to increase capacity. - _Marketing and CRM—We have strengthened our marketing approaches and we are taking a more sophisticated and data-driven approach to membership acquisition and retention. Pure Gym’s brand awareness is strong but has further room for significant growth in the context of our large estate of gyms. We utilize channels, such as television advertising and social media, to increase brand awareness and drive membership growth. Fitness World’s brand awareness is high in Denmark and we are continuing to build on this awareness by marketing services and products through the Fitness World designated app, social media, and through our association with brand ambassadors. - _Development of new sales channels and cross marketing—We are leveraging our nationwide scale in the UK and in Denmark to identify opportunities to partner and enter into commercial arrangements with large corporations that have the potential to deliver incremental membership volumes. - _Leveraging our technology infrastructure—We have made significant investments in our IT team and infrastructure and believe this helps us provide a value-added member experience and the opportunity for additional member sales. _Maintaining a rigorous focus on cost containment—Our ability to offer low membership fees and generate_ strong unit economics and ROCEs is underpinned by our low-cost operating model. As a result, we are focused on optimizing and controlling gym-level operating costs, as well as Initial Capital Investment Costs. These costs are controlled centrally and we intend to continue to leverage our growing scale in order to achieve more favourable purchasing terms with third-party suppliers, service providers and contractors. In addition, we are pursuing a number of ongoing operational efficiency projects, such as energy saving initiatives, to minimize future gym-level cost increases and improve returns. Following several years of investment into central functions such as IT, marketing and finance, we believe that our central functions are well invested and that we will not require significant incremental central cost expansion in the medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

We continue to focus on driving the operational and financial performance of New Gyms as they mature, with key areas of focus including: - Using our experience to select attractive gym locations where the demand and demographics result in predictable financial performance - Consistency of delivery and high standards - Leveraging our experience to adapt to local markets 10 ----- - Optimization of volume and ARPM in each gym - Driving scale benefits - Successfully increasing margins and member enrolment for newly-acquired businesses We plan to leverage our experience to continue the organic roll out of new gyms with strong ROCE. Future growth in the value segment will be driven by the development of new value gyms, continued market share gains from mid-market and premium operators, as well as public gyms operated by local authorities, and overall growth in gym participation rates due in part to the increasing awareness and availability of value gyms in each of our markets. The significant opportunity for further growth in the value gym market is evidenced by: - The significant success of the value gym concept to date and its broad consumer appeal. - The current overall penetration rates of gym membership in existing markets as of December 2019; only 16% of the British population, 19% of Danish population, 14% of the Swiss population, and 8% of the Polish population have gym memberships (Source: OC&C Report). We believe that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this substantial market penetration opportunity as market leaders in the United Kingdom and Denmark with a long, successful track record of opening new gyms and rapidly growing membership, revenue and profitability. The Combined Group has a structured and disciplined approach to site identification, acquisition and development. Our property acquisition teams are highly experienced and have a strong network of property agents, landlords and developers that provide us with a substantial number of new site opportunities. Our gyms have been proven to work across the United Kingdom and Denmark in a wide variety of property types and, accordingly, management considers a broad number of locations for new gyms. We have also proven our ability to innovate through initially testing and now proving the small box format (“SBF”) concept in the UK, which features gyms that are 6,000 to 9,000 square feet in size and enable us to adapt the Pure Gym model to smaller local markets. The UK and Denmark have similar levels of ROCE though different cost structures. Gyms in Denmark generate lower margins and require lower initial capital expenditure compared to UK gyms, due to sizeable landlord contributions and that are partly offset by higher rents. Landlords in Denmark frequently pay for a substantial part of the initial club fit-out costs, thus reducing the payback periods and increasing ROCE.

Reopening the Group's gym estate has been successful, as evidenced by positive member feedback, which has translated to encouraging member trends in like-for-like member volumes as well as gym visits. As a result, our principal shareholder, certain affiliated funds of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P.

The partial lockdown is currently in effect until December 3, 2020, however, there is a risk that it could be extended or that further regional lockdowns, closures or restrictions could be imposed.

211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Initial lockdown start date** **Initial lockdown end date UK ............................................,9.8.1,Initial Reopening,"Despite an extended closure period due to the initial mandated government lockdown measures in the countries in which we operate, our business returned to profitability in the initial reopening that took place in August and September 2020 following the reopening of our UK estate, with gyms in both Switzerland and Denmark returning to profitability in the month of their reopening following the initial lockdown period. The charts below show the resilience of our business model as evidenced by our rapid return to profitability in August and September following initial lockdown period in the countries in which we operate. While the trend observed in August and September 2020 demonstrated our resilience at that point in time, there can be no assurance that our recovery following subsequent lockdowns would be comparably robust. Member feedback on our first reopening was positive and translated to positive member trends in like-forlike member volumes as well as gym visits, particularly among the younger member demographic which displayed a greater propensity to return to the gym. This initial membership trend continued in the UK, where our median member age is below that of our gyms in Denmark and Switzerland: the UK business has the youngest demographic mix in the group (median member age is 28 in the UK, 30 in Denmark and 31 in Switzerland). As at October 18, 2020, we had approximately 1.6 million closing members across the Combined Group, which represents like-for-like members versus membership levels at the same point in 2019 of 80% in the UK, 90% in Denmark and 93% in Switzerland and there have been no confirmed reports of COVID-19 transmission in our gyms reported after more than 26 million visits since reopening. Member visits in the UK increased to 86% in late October, as compared to the same point in 2019. In August 2020, like-for-like average revenue per member was higher than August 2019, with an increase of 3% in the UK and 7% in Denmark. Our gyms across the UK were closed for a longer period than our gyms in Europe and therefore experienced more leavers during the initial lockdown period. However, as at October 26, 2020, substantially all of our 236 gyms in England had been open for approximately 13 weeks and our 25 gyms in Scotland had open for approximately seven weeks. Membership levels in the UK reached 80% as of late October 2020 as compared to the same point in 2019. Our cleaning protocols were a major factor driving increasing membership levels during the initial reopening phase. The Combined Group’s operating protocols have been centred on enhanced safety measures in adherence with government health and safety guidelines. These safety protocols include extensive training for employees and members, which is comprised of greater visibility of the new rules through our website, social media, mobile app, and on the gym floor at point-of-sale and video screens. For example, in the UK, we have developed an extensive, multistage approach to ensuring sufficient club capacity in line with social distancing measures, including a two-meter distance rule across the gym floor and locker room, implementing 15 minute access windows for slot booking, allowing “over booking” to optimize capacity usage, disabling every other cardio machine in order to maintain separation, 50% maximum capacity for our group exercise classes, reducing free weight equipment and clearly delineating floor spacers to create two-meter workout stations. For example, during the week of September 7 to 17 ----- September 13, 2020, 12.9% of our UK gyms reached 90% of capacity for at least one hour. We use our advanced technology platform to provide “live” feeds of current attendance to enable members to choose when to visit the gym and to ensure controlled entry: for example, between August 31, 2020 and September 6, 2020, 38% of entrants entered using a QR code. Our cleaning protocols have also been upgraded to allow for three levels of cleaning, including the cleaning of high touch points every three hours, an overnight deep clean of all facilities by our contract partners, and encouragement for members to clean kit before and after their gym session. We also provide anti-viral wipe stations around the gym and personal protective equipment for all of our staff. Our safety protocols are backed by enforcement policies in order to ensure that members are complying with the measures we have implemented. If members repeatedly fail to comply with the new policies, their membership will be terminated. Across Denmark, Switzerland and Poland, similar COVID-responsive protocols have been adopted to ensure that our facilities are in line with or ahead of the minimum requirements within each of those geographies. In addition to our safety protocols, the geographic diversity of our gym estate and our dynamic pricing model were distinctive features that set us apart from our competitors during the initial reopening phase. In the UK, although we operate gyms in centrally-located, worker-centric locations throughout major cities in the countries in which we operate, we are not heavily reliant on these locations in isolation in order to earn a significant percentage of our revenue with only 16% of our gyms constituting worker-centric gyms and on average 26% to 37% of the members of these worker-centric gym members having multi-club access to our other gym locations as at February 2020, giving us extensive reach in residential areas outside of city limits and helping to counteract the effects of individuals working from home. Of the 274 total gyms we operated in the UK as at November 8, 2020, 209 are not located in the city centre. Of these 274 gyms, 65 are in city centre locations, 45 are in worker-centric locations, and 20 are in residential areas in London and thus removed from worker-centric locations. Members with gym memberships to our workercentric locations also enjoy multi-club access, with an average of 37% of our members who work in London opting for a premium membership option that allows them the benefit of also accessing a residential gym location if desired. The chart below shows the breakdown of multi-gym access memberships for our UK members as of February 2020. In addition to geographic diversity, in the UK, our “live” feed technology allows members to monitor how busy each gym is and has the added benefit of allowing us to manage capacity in accordance with government guidelines while also encouraging gym attendance throughout the day and outside peak periods. Gym capacity during the initial reopening phase was less restricted than previously by traditional working day constraints and was instead characterized by steady attendance throughout the day rather than in peak periods in the morning and in the evening. In the UK in particular, we also have the ability to drive members to our other gym locations by offering more competitive price points if one of our gyms is particularly busy. In the event of an outbreak in any of our open gyms across Europe, we are equipped to provide contact details through our controlled membership entry in order to enable test and trace procedures to be properly implemented and will increase our cleaning capacities in proportion to what 18 ----- is deemed necessary to prevent future outbreaks. We remain committed to acting in accordance with the guidance provided by the relevant authorities in the countries in which we operate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Initial lockdown start date** **Initial lockdown end date UK ............................................,9.8.2,Subsequent lockdown period and additional coronavirus restrictions,"On October 31, 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced a second national lockdown across England, which came into effect on November 5, 2020, and required the temporary re-closure of all of our gyms until at least December 2, 2020, subject to government review (the “second lockdown period”). Consistent with our approach during the initial lockdown period, we have placed members on “free freeze” and as a result all our revenues from our sites in England have ceased. On November 5, 2020, the Danish government announced a number of COVID-19 related restrictions and measures in the area of Northern Jutland, (comprising the seven Danish municipalities of Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted, Vesthimmerland and Læsø) following the discovery of a mutated coronavirus referred to as “Cluster 5”, which is believed to spread from minks to humans. The restrictions were enacted following the detection of the virus traced to the region’s mink farms. Consequently, the Northern Jutland region has been placed on a partial lockdown and Fitness World has closed six gyms in the area as a result of the restrictions. The partial lockdown is currently in effect until December 3, 2020, subject to government review. On October 29, 2020, the Swiss government enacted a number of heightened coronavirus restrictions as a result of increasing daily number of coronavirus cases across Switzerland. The new restrictions include a duty to wear masks in all enclosed public spaces and in other busy public spaces, a ban on public events with more than 50 attendees as well as a ban on sports and cultural activities involving more than 15 people, partial lockdowns in specific areas of the country, reduced travel, and the suspension of night bus and train routes. As a result of the new restrictions, we have closed three of our sites in Switzerland. In order to mitigate against the effects of the coronavirus restrictions in the countries in which we operate, we have again acted swiftly to implement a cash preservation strategy, significantly reducing cash outflows from the business to maximize our liquidity position. We estimate that our UK weekly operational cash burn will be £1.9 million per week during the four week closure of our sites in England based on £1.0 million per week in government support through the rates holiday and the furlough scheme, £0.7 million per week in revenue from our gyms that are currently still open in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and £0.4 million per week in operational cost savings. We estimate that our total UK cash burn due to the four week closure in England will be £6.0 million to £9.0 million before factoring in rent negotiations with landlords or any deferment activity. As a result, we estimate the net impact on Group cash and liquidity of the England lockdown in November and December 2020 will be £5.0 million to £10.0 million, after taking into account cash flows from our operations in Denmark and Switzerland.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Initial lockdown start date** **Initial lockdown end date UK ............................................,9.8.3,Planning for the future,"While we are cognizant that the risks presented to our business by COVID-19 may continue beyond the second lockdown period, our management team has proven that it can guide the business through an unprecedented set of circumstances in which the business generates zero revenue by quickly implementing a cash preservation strategy. We believe we are ready to act in accordance with a cash preservation strategy by (i) pausing growth, maintenance and refurbishment capital expenditures, (ii) reducing operational costs, (iii) deferring payments to landlords and suppliers to the extent permissible and (iv) utilizing the government support that is available to our business. Following the Equity Injection and the RCF upsize, we believe that our business has ample financial reserves to absorb the impact of the second lockdown period. We believe that our budget model is well-positioned to weather further waves of COVID-19 and future mandated government lockdown measures through the end of this year and to mid-2021, as well as the consequent downturn in economic conditions due to our management team’s ability to effectively implement a cash preservation strategy in conjunction with our liquidity reserves following the Equity Injection and RCF upsize. When our gym estate in England is permitted to reopen, we also believe that we are well-positioned to contend with consumer dynamics in a possible economic downturn given our value gym pricing proposition. Pure Gym was founded in a recessionary environment and grew rapidly during difficult economic times because consumers turned to value 19 ----- offerings rather than premium gym brands (see “Industry Overview”). According to OC&C, client trends have indicated that gym membership is a form of “low-cost entertainment” and is habitual in terms of usage patterns, which enables clients to not only _seek value gym offerings but also_ _retain them during a recessionary environment, particularly as a form of stress management. Based on the experience we have in managing our business in prior economic downturns, we anticipate that in the event of an economic downturn, traditional operators will abstain from investing in their gym sites and default to raising prices, both of which are factors we believe will drive clients to our gyms. In the period between the initial reopening and the commencement of the second lockdown period, we managed multiple local lockdowns that impacted our gym estate. For ten weeks between June 29, 2020 and September 8, 2020, Leicester (a two-gym city cluster) was put into local lockdown. The actual cost to us for this lockdown period was approximately £398,000 (an average of £83,000 per club per month). Beginning on October 14, 2020, Liverpool (a seven-gym city cluster) was put into local lockdown and gyms closed for the ten days between October 14, 2020 and October 24, 2020. The actual cost to us for this lockdown period was approximately £190,000 (an average of £84,000 per club per month). We have a strategy to deal with the second lockdown period by leveraging our experience with the initial lockdowns. This strategy consists of pausing our capital expenditure, implementing operational cost reductions, deferring payments to landlords and suppliers where possible and effectively utilizing support from the relevant governments to the extent available (noting that the UK business rates holiday is ongoing through the 2020/2021 tax year and the UK furlough scheme has been extended through to March 2021). However, we can provide no assurance that government support will be offered at equivalent levels to those during the initial lockdowns or at all in the event of further lockdowns. Were government support to not be available, or to be available on a more limited basis, we would only be able to rely on our ability to pause capital expenditures, implement cost reductions and defer payments, which could significantly reduce our overall ability to mitigate cash burn. In addition to comprehensive contingency planning and financial modelling for further waves of COVID-19 and future mandated government lockdown measures through the end of this year and to mid-2021, we are continuing to build on our strong technological platform by investing in at-home and digital fitness given the surge in home workout demand during COVID-19. The Fitness World app is already a staple of our business (see “Business— _Marketing—Fitness World”) and we are continuing to optimize the Pure Gym app in order to provide our customers_ with at-home workout options. For example, as of September 11, 2020, there were 1.15 million total “on phone” downloads by 420,000 non-members and 730,000 members, demonstrating that 70% of the Pure Gym membership base used the Pure Gym app. Demand for the app has remained healthy, with approximately 150,000 at-home workouts being conducted on the app from July 20, 2020 to August 16, 2020, for example. “At-home workouts” correlate to each time a user starts playback on a workout video. We have also experienced an increase in app downloads, with approximately 140,000 new users during the same period. We expect that at home and digital fitness will continue to be a complementary opportunity for us and we plan to continue investing accordingly. _Future expansion opportunities_ Prior to the initial and second lockdown periods in the countries in which we operate, we had a robust growth strategy in place with respect to both organic site development in the UK and opportunities abroad. We continue to have a range of expansion opportunities, including at our test sites in the U.S. and across Switzerland, as well as further opportunities to expand our gym estate in our key markets and enter into international franchise agreements. Our expansion pipeline remains strong, with 151 sites in the organic site development pipeline for our gyms in the UK. Of these 151 sites, 61 sites have been approved by the Board and 90 are in the first stage of capital expenditure committee approval. For four of our recently opened UK gyms, member levels tracked our average target member feasibility levels within weeks of reopening, indicating a positive upward trend. However, before pursuing further expansion or franchising opportunities, we plan to monitor the property market and expect to manage our commitments prudently to ensure we maintain adequate operational liquidity with respect to our current and future expansion projects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Some revenues were received during closure periods in Fitness World Denmark as a result of offers made to members and, in the UK, a small amount of revenue was secured from the PureGym Together product. However, in aggregate, almost all of our revenue effectively ceased until the phased initial reopening of our gyms began on May 11, 2020 in Switzerland, June 6, 2020 in Poland, June 11, 2020 in Denmark, and from July 10, 2020 in the UK. The duration of the initial lockdowns are described above. At the foundation of all business decisions we made in response to COVID-19 was our concern for, and attention to, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and members. In addition, we took every step that we believed was prudent to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our liquidity. The Group had a strong year in 2019 and a robust start to 2020, both of which enabled us to enter the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial strength; however, the spread of COVID-19 and the prolonged shutdown of our gym estate during the initial lockdown period had a material negative impact on our business. In order to mitigate against these negative effects, we acted swiftly to implement a cash preservation strategy, significantly reducing cash outflows from the business to maximize our liquidity position. Specifically, we adopted the following measures during the initial lockdown period in each of the countries in which we operate: - actively engaged with our landlords to seek deferrals and/or rent-free periods across the Combined Group while certain of our gyms remain closed; 14 ----- - cut marketing and advertisement spend to nearly zero in the initial lockdown period; - furloughed almost our entire workforce with members of senior management foregoing their salary for a period of three months and many other staff members taking significant voluntarily salary reductions; and - significantly reduced our planned capital expenditure program, which resulted in a reduced scope of work that was focused on concluding current projects, essential maintenance and infrastructure work in our current gym estate. We were also able to utilize government support effectively in order to significantly mitigate our average weekly cash burn rate. The government initiatives we utilized as mitigation measures across the Combined Group included: - the UK Job Retention Scheme, a salary compensation scheme in relation to the costs of furloughed staff, which is in effect until the end of March 2021; - UK tax deferrals in which VAT payments for the first quarter are deferred until March 2021 and PAYE and NIC payments for the second quarter were deferred to July 2020; - the UK business rates holiday for the 2020/2021 tax year; - the Danish salary compensation scheme relating to furloughed employees; - the Danish fixed cost compensation scheme; - Danish extensions of the payment deadlines for Danish “A-tax” and labour market contributions, as well as extensions of VAT payment deadlines; Fitness World's Danish entities have automatically benefitted from these extended payment deadlines; - Danish VAT loan scheme for small- and medium-sized businesses; and - the Swiss salary compensation scheme relating to furloughed employees. Prior to the initial lockdown period, net average cash outflow for the Combined Group was £9 million per week on an unmitigated basis, consisting of £8 million in operating cash cost and £1 million in interest cash cost per week. As a result of the cost-cutting strategies, cash-saving measures, revenue initiatives and access to government initiatives we took, the Combined Group’s liquidity declined by only £18 million throughout the 14-week initial lockdown closure period (£1.3 million per week on average) from March 23, 2020 to June 26, 2020. This primarily consisted of £11 million of payments in relation to capital expenditures (being projects completed prior to the initial lockdown period) and £7 million of interest payments that fell due during the period. The Combined Group therefore effectively reduced, deferred or offset all of its unmitigated £8 million weekly operating cash cost burden during this 14-week initial lockdown period. Of the £8 million unmitigated weekly operating cash cost, £4 million was saved through a combination of reducing operating costs, landlord forbearance and assistance received from governments (furlough monies, fixed overhead compensation and rates relief), £2.0 million (comprising £2.5 million of deferred payments net of £0.5 million of receipts) has been deferred into the second half of 2020 and £2 million has been offset through various revenue and other cash collection activities. An additional £15 million of deferrals are due to be settled in 2021. Additionally, we believe that we have ample liquidity to manage the second wave of coronavirus restrictions that are currently in force and expect payment deferrals to remain manageable through the end of 2020. Under our current modelling and in light of the current lockdowns in place in the countries in which we operate, we estimate that 15 ----- we will have £215 to £220 million of available liquidity as at December 31, 2020. In the event of further simultaneous national lockdowns across the UK, Denmark and Switzerland, assuming the business were able to mitigate 50% of its weekly cash burn rate of £9.0 million, then management estimates that the business could be sustained for approximately 12 months. For more information about the risks associated with the impact of subsequent waves of COVID-19 and lockdowns on our ability to minimize cash burn, see “Risk Factors—The negative impact of COVID_19 on our business is significant and its effects will continue to materially negatively impact our business, financial _condition and results of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control”. The chart below_ compares our pro forma liquidity as of June 30, 2020 and August 28, 2020 and our actual liquidity as of October 31, 2020 with our projected liquidity post-deferred payments as of December 31, 2020. The projections included below are based on estimates and assumptions made as of early November 2020, which assume that the second lockdown period in England will last four weeks and assumes that growth capex, exceptional items and settlement of deferred payments will amount to the figures presented below, which are based on management estimates. 16 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

We are in regular contact with the governments in our key markets to keep abreast of the availability of and our eligibility for government support. Our shareholders remain highly supportive of our business and optimistic about its long-term prospects, as shown by the Equity Injection. Between the end of the initial lockdown period and the commencement of the second lockdown period, we were recovering well. For example, during the initial lockdown period, our gyms across the UK were closed for a longer period than our gyms in Europe and therefore experienced more leavers during the lockdown period.

The average number of members is calculated as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in that period. (5) This measure is not defined under IFRS. It should be noted in this context that not all companies calculate the items that are not defined under IFRS in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable with similarly described measures employed by other companies. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the financial period as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. Our management uses these measures to assess our operating performance. In addition, we believe that similar measures are commonly used by investors. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data”.

In the six months ended June 30, 2020, exceptional administrative expenses consisted of £1.1 million of costs related to the transition and integration of Fitness World into the group, £0.9 million of costs related to restructuring of the existing business, and £0.7 million of costs related to the exploration of acquisition and expansion opportunities. (b) Refers to the net impact of various one-off items not included in “exceptional administrative expenses”. (c) Pre-Opening Costs represents the total of all gym site operating costs incurred during the pre-opening periods of gyms in that period. Pre-Opening Costs primarily consist of staff and marketing expenses. (d) Represents the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA (as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). Management believes that adjusting EBITDA to reflect cash rent is a better reflection of our actual earnings. (e) Head Office Costs for a given period are defined as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization, related to the operation of head office functions in that period. (f) Run-Rate Adjustment is an adjustment made to those gyms which are less than three years old at the end of the reporting period. These adjustments replace the Adjusted EBITDA earned by these sites in the last twelve month period with the projected Adjusted EBITDA for their third year of operation. Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA therefore seeks to reflect the anticipated mature Adjusted EBITDA potential of those gyms which were trading at the end of the relevant period. Management forecasts EBITDA on a gym-specific basis and updates forecasts quarterly based on current and anticipated performance, taking into account seasonality and location-specific factors. See “Business—Key Strengths—High cash flow generative profile underpinned by exceptional profitability and positive working _capital cash inflows”._ We believe that our gyms generate Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA at a substantially mature rate at month 24, therefore months 25 to 36 represent the first full year of mature EBITDA performance. We believe these run-rate adjustments are appropriate because, based on our experience and the actual performance of gyms open fewer than two years, the first two years of operation are unrepresentative of run-rate trading. Management has confidence in these gyms achieving their estimated run-rate profitability, given the consistent and predictable ramp-up delivered by the gym cohorts in previous years. These adjustments to EBITDA are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had newly opened gyms been open for the entire period nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying the adjustments are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our _business—Certain non-IFRS measures such as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results”._ (g) Synergy adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 of £4.5 million (DKK 39.7 million converted to pounds sterling at the spot rate of DKK 8.7469 to £1.000 as of December 31, 2019) (composed of £1.9 million of overheads and procurement synergies, £0.8 million in IT cost optimization synergies and £1.8 million in estate optimization synergies) and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 of £4.9 million (DKK 39.7 million, as converted to GBP at the spot rate of DKK 8.1635 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) reflect specific identified cost savings for the Combined Group.

As adjusted Net Debt as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 represents total senior secured indebtedness of the Combined Group of £873.2 million (composed of the Existing Notes (£430 million), the Notes (£406.2 million) and drawings of £37.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility) less cash and cash equivalents of £180.6 million (composed of the Equity Injection (£100.0 million) and cash on balance sheet (£88.6 million) less the use of £8.0 million to be used to pay certain transaction fees, miscellaneous expenses and other payments incurred on completion of the Offering).

In light of the unprecedented COVID-19-related temporary business closures of all our gyms imposed by the governments of the countries in which we operate at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and during the second quarter of 2020, management does not believe that the ratio of as adjusted June 30, 2020 Net Debt to LTM Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2020 of 6.8x is representative of the historical performance of the Combined Group, given current management assumptions.

The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future period. The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated on October 30, 2017, for the purpose of consummating the 2017 Acquisition (as defined below) and the related financing thereof. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and as of the Issue Date its only material assets will be its holding of the entire issued share capital of the Combined Group as well as rights and claims under intercompany financings. The Issuer’s only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Notes, the Notes and certain subordinated shareholder debt. For further information, please see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Business” and “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements”._ The Issuer acquired Topco on November 30, 2017 (the “2017 Acquisition Date”) and the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements (as defined below) encompass the 14-month period of trading from the 2017 Acquisition Date to December 31, 2018. As a result, the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements are not directly comparable to the 2017 Topco Financial Statements or the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements (each as defined below), both of which were prepared on a 12-month basis. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, this Offering Memorandum provides the 2018 Topco Financial Statements (as defined below) for comparative purposes rather than the 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements. The 2018 Pure Gym 14-Month Financial Statements have been included in the index to this Offering Memorandum for reference purposes only. With respect to the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements, Pure Gym applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method, for transition and measuring right of use assets using the retrospective calculation, both as defined by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. Cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were therefore recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. The 2017 Topco Financial Statements and the 2018 Topco Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognizes a right-ofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or Pure Gym EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the finance lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. See Note 27 “Change in Accounting Policies” of the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements. Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected for any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and ratios that we report herein, such as Pure Gym Adjusted EBITDA, Pure Gym Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, and Pure Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA and certain other measures (each as defined in this Offering Memorandum), are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using different methodologies and having different results.

(2) We define total number of members as the total number of active members, including the total number of members who have suspended (to “freeze” or have “frozen”) their memberships, but excluding “pay-as-you-go” customers, the total number of members who have cancelled their memberships and the total number of pre-opening members of organic gyms that have yet to open, as of the specified date or the end date of the relevant period. (3) We define average number of members per gym as the average of the number of members for each gym as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in that period. (4) We define average revenue per member per month as revenue for that period divided by the number of months in that period and further divided by the average number of members during that period. The average number of members during that period is calculated as the average of the number of members as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in that period. 30 ----- 31 ----- (c) Pre-Opening Costs represents the total of all gym site operating costs incurred during the pre-opening periods of gyms in that period. Pre-Opening Costs primarily consist of staff, marketing and also rent expenses when reporting under IAS17. (d) From January 1, 2019, as the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA (as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). Pre January 1, 2019, under IAS17, the total rent payable over the life of the lease is spread over the lease term and charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in arriving at EBITDA. As we typically receive a rent free period of a year or more as an incentive from developers or landlords to lease space in their buildings this results in rent charged to EBITDA being greater than the cash outlay in the early years of the lease term and less than the cash outlay in the later years of the lease term. The Cash Rent Adjustment adds back any non-cash element of the rent expensed in the period during these early years (less any amounts already added back as a Pre-Opening Cost) and deducts any shortfall in rent expense in the later years to reflect the actual cash outlay due for that period under our lease arrangements. Management believes that adjusting EBITDA to reflect cash rent is a better reflection of our actual earnings. (e) Head Office Costs for a given period are defined as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization, related to the operation of head office functions in that period. (f) Run-Rate Adjustment is an adjustment made to those gyms which are less than three years old at the end of the reporting period. These adjustments replace the Adjusted EBITDA earned by these sites in the last twelve month period with the projected Adjusted EBITDA for their third year of operation. Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA therefore seeks to reflect the anticipated mature Adjusted EBITDA potential of those gyms which were trading at the end of the relevant period. Management forecasts EBITDA on a gym-specific basis and updates forecasts quarterly based on current and anticipated performance, taking into account seasonality and location-specific factors. See “Business—Key Strengths—High cash flow generative profile underpinned by exceptional profitability and positive working _capital cash inflows”._ We believe that our gyms generate Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA at a mature rate at month 24, therefore months 25 to 36 represent the first full year of mature EBITDA performance. We believe these run-rate adjustments are appropriate because, based on our experience and the actual performance of gyms open fewer than two years, the first two years of operation are unrepresentative of run-rate trading. Management has confidence in these gyms achieving their estimated run-rate profitability, given the consistent and predictable rampup delivered by the gym cohorts in previous years. These adjustments to EBITDA are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had newly opened gyms been open for the entire period nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying the adjustments are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—Certain non-IFRS _measures such as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results”._ (g) Synergy adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 2020 of £4.9 million (DKK 39.7 million, as converted to GBP at the spot rate of DKK 8.1635 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) reflect specific identified cost savings for the Combined Group.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, special items (net) were DKK 28.5 million principally including post-merger integration costs related to the acquisition of Basefit.ch AG, other M&A costs, internal restructuring costs and costs related to ongoing legal proceedings (including related provisions), which were partially offset by a gain related to the settlement of VAT claims. (b) Other extraordinary items refers to the net impact of various one-off items not included in “exceptional administrative expenses”. (c) Pre-Opening Costs represents the total of all gym site operating costs incurred during the pre-opening periods of gyms in that period. Pre-Opening Costs primarily consist of staff, marketing and also rent expenses when reporting under IAS17. (d) From January 1, 2019, as the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA (as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). Pre January 1, 2019, under IAS17, the total rent payable over the life of the lease is spread over the lease term and charged to the income statement on a straight line basis in arriving at EBITDA. As we typically receive a rent free period of a year or more as an incentive from developers or landlords to lease space in their buildings this results in rent charged to EBITDA being greater than the cash outlay in the early years of the lease term and less than the cash outlay in the later years of the lease term. The Cash Rent Adjustment adds back any non-cash element of the rent expensed in the period during these early years (less any amounts already added back as a Pre-Opening Cost) and deducts any shortfall in rent expense in the later years to reflect the actual cash outlay due for that period under our lease arrangements. Management believes that adjusting EBITDA to reflect cash rent is a better reflection of our actual earnings. (e) Head Office Costs for a given period are defined as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization, related to the operation of head office functions in that period. (f) Run-Rate Adjustment is an adjustment made to those gyms which are less than three years old at the end of the reporting period. These adjustments replace the Adjusted EBITDA earned by these sites in the last twelve month period with the projected Adjusted EBITDA for their third year of operation. Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA therefore seeks to reflect the anticipated mature Adjusted EBITDA potential of those gyms which were trading at the end of the relevant period. The number of gyms in this category are 13 gyms open less than 12 months (accounting for 40% of the adjustment), 23 gyms open between 13 and 24 months (accounting for 59% of the adjustment), and 25 gyms open between 25 and 36 months (accounting for 1% of the adjustments). Management forecasts EBITDA on a gym-specific basis and updates forecasts quarterly based on current and anticipated performance, taking into account seasonality and location-specific factors. See “Business—Key Strengths—High cash flow generative profile underpinned by exceptional profitability _and positive working capital cash inflows”._ We believe that our gyms generate Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA at a mature rate at month 24, therefore months 25 to 36 represent the first full year of mature EBITDA performance. We believe these run-rate adjustments are appropriate because, based on our experience and the actual performance of gyms open fewer than two years, the first two years of operation are unrepresentative of run-rate trading. Management has confidence in these gyms achieving their estimated run-rate profitability, given the consistent and predictable rampup delivered by the gym cohorts in previous years. These adjustments to EBITDA are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had newly opened stores been open for the entire period nor does it purport to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying the adjustments are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—Certain non-IFRS _measures such as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results”._ The Run-Rate Adjustment does not include Pre-Opening Costs and is net of the Cash Rent Adjustment and approximately DKK 2.5 million cash rent amounts added back to Adjusted EBITDA as part of Pre-Opening Costs. (g) Reflects the 2019 average rate of DKK 8.5268 to £1.0000.

Forward TopCo A/S was established on March 30, 2015. The financial information contained in the following tables comprising summary of consolidated information is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Fitness World as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 with comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Other financial and operational data for Fitness World is derived from Fitness World’s internal reporting systems. Fitness World consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 with comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by EY Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab. See “Independent Auditors” and “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees _and the Collateral—Investors in the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors” for a_ description of the independent auditors’ reports of EY Godkendt Revisionspartnerselskab. With respect to the 2019 Fitness World Financial Statements, Fitness World applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective method”. Therefore, cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 was to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or Fitness World EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the finance lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. See Note 29 “Changes in accounting policies and disclosures” of the 2019 Fitness World Financial Statements. Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected for any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and ratios that we report herein, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, and Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA and certain other measures (each as defined in this Offering Memorandum), are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using different methodologies and having different results.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns, have led to an economic downturn in our markets and have had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operate. In March 2020, the governments of all of the countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19 and, in doing so, required the temporary closure of all of our gyms. When lockdowns occurred, our overall approach was to place members on “free freeze” and as a result almost all our revenues ceased. Some revenues were received during the initial lockdown period in Fitness World Denmark as a result of offers made to members and, in the UK, a small amount of revenue was secured from the PureGym Together product. However, in aggregate, almost all of our revenue effectively ceased until the phased reopening of our gyms following the initial lockdown period began on May 11, 2020 in Switzerland, June 6, 2020 in Poland, June 11, 2020 in Denmark and July 10, 2020 in the UK. Further, following the second wave that is currently underway in Europe, we cannot predict when or where these waves will occur, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by the governments and/or local or regional authorities of the countries in which we operate. We also cannot guarantee that the markets in which we operate will ever return to the norms, lifestyle and gym attendance patterns that existed before the emergence of COVID-19, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, a second wave of COVID-19 is underway in Europe, with cases rising markedly in all of the geographies in which we operate. On October 12, 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced a three-tiered system of restrictions across England which came into effect on October 14, 2020. On October 14, 2020, Liverpool and a number of other cities in the Merseyside area (including Knowsley, Wirral, St. Helens, Sefton and Halton) (where we operated seven gyms as of October 26, 2020) were placed in Tier 3. Under the baseline for Tier 3 restrictions, gyms were not automatically closed in affected areas, but gyms could be closed in areas subject to Tier 3 restrictions under “additional measures” imposed by national or local government, which was the case in the Merseyside area. However, after ten days of closure and a media/lobbying campaign spearheaded by PureGym, seven gyms in the 46 ----- Merseyside area were reopened after gyms were removed from ""additional measures"" to Tier 3 restrictions. While gyms may remain open where Tier 1 and Tier 2 restrictions apply, there can be no guarantee that, in the event the tier system is re-implemented in the future, this would continue to be the case or that more stringent rules and restrictions would not be applied in the future in a manner that could materially adversely impact our business. Additionally, local authorities had the power to impose stricter rules and restrictions in addition to those imposed by the national three-tiered system, which may have further material adverse impacts on our business and industry. During the period in which the tier system was in place, many of our gyms were in areas that were in Tier 2 or Tier 3. Under the tier system, Tier 2 areas could rapidly become Tier 3 areas; likewise, Tier 1 areas could rapidly become Tier 2 (and even Tier 3) areas. The placement of areas into the tiers was outside of our control and was dynamic and unpredictable. The three-tiered alert system applied only to England: the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to design and implement their own coronavirus restrictions, which may be as or more stringent than the English three-tiered system. We also cannot exclude the possibility of the addition of additional tiers or more stringent tier-based restrictions being imposed should the government deem the tiers insufficient to certain rising virus levels. The tier system was subsequently replaced by the second national lockdown that is described below. However, the tier system, or another set of comparable or more severe restrictions could be put in place in the future. On October 31, 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced a second national lockdown across England, which came into effect on November 5, 2020, and required the temporary re-closure of all of our English gyms until at least December 2, 2020, subject to government review. Consistent with our approach during the initial lockdown period, we have placed members on “free freeze” and, as a result, all our revenues have ceased from our sites in England. The imposition of future local and national lockdowns in response to the level of coronavirus case levels across Europe is outside of our control and is expected to be dynamic and unpredictable. Furthermore, the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of designing and implementing their own coronavirus restrictions, which may be as or more stringent than the lockdown measures imposed in England. In Denmark, the Northern Jutland region has been placed on partial lockdown and we have closed six of our gyms as a result of the lockdown. In Switzerland, we have closed three of our gyms as a result of local lockdown measures. In light of rising case levels across Europe, future national and local lockdowns are foreseeable in all of the countries in which we operate. Even when our gyms are allowed to safely open, social distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further spread of the disease may impact the operation and member appeal of our gyms. For example, members unaccustomed to waiting significant periods of time before using certain exercise equipment or to increased cleaning periods may cancel their memberships. In some locations, for example, in Switzerland, members may be required to wear masks or other protective equipment, which may deter members from attending our gyms and may cause them to cancel or suspend their memberships. Even when social distancing policies are lifted, interest in visiting our gyms may remain weak due to health concerns or changes in exercise preferences in favour of online or on-demand platforms. We cannot predict if and when each of our gyms will return to pre-outbreak membership levels or if they will be able to maintain pre-outbreak membership levels and pricing terms over the mid- to long-term. We also cannot predict whether member cancellation rates will increase in subsequent lockdown periods as compared to the initial lockdown period. Additionally, policies implemented to slow the further spread of the disease have impacted and will continue to impact our cost of doing business due to, among other things, the increased cost associated with hygiene measures and track and trace programs. Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by consumers, public health events and other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section. To date, this outbreak has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity globally, which could lead to a decline in discretionary spending by our members. Our revenue may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Our revenue may not increase in proportion to our fixed costs and deferred costs and our revenue may not be sufficient to offset the full impact of the shutdown of our gyms during the initial and second lockdown periods. If our cost base is higher than our revenue, our cash management policies may fail due to factors beyond our control. During the time our gyms were permitted to reopen, we took extensive measures to protect our members and our workforce, including our key management and our cleaning and technical personnel, in order to minimize their exposure to COVID-19. However, we cannot be certain that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 and we may be subject to potential litigation as a result of members or our personnel who contract, or believe they have contracted, the virus at our gyms. We may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. We may also be at risk of litigation following a possible outbreak at one of our gyms, which may cause us to incur further significant costs and which 47 ----- may have a negative impact on our reputation. All of these risks may be further exacerbated by resurgences of the virus. Although governments have increasingly employed sophisticated strategies for combatting the virus such as Test and Trace or localized R-factor measurement, the magnitude of possible virus resurgences and the resulting impacts on the economy may materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. During the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, the Group relied on access to government aid and mitigation programs and the ability to defer certain payments (i.e. as a result of negotiations with landlords) in order to minimize cash outlays. Our mitigation strategy was reinforced by legislation such as the UK Coronavirus Act 2020 and the UK Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 which introduced certain protections in relation to lease forfeitures, restrictions on the use of Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery, and temporary restrictions on the ability of creditors to file statutory demands and winding up petitions in the UK based solely on the failure to comply with (for example) rent payment obligations as a result of COVID-19. We cannot provide any assurance that during the current and subsequent waves of COVID-19 and current and subsequent lockdowns such government aid, mitigation programs, negotiations with landlords and/or protective legislation will be available to the same extent as in the past or at all and, if this were the case, our cash outlay levels would be significantly higher during the current and subsequent waves than they were in the initial wave. Were government support to not be available, or to be available on a more limited basis, we would only be able to rely on our ability to pause capital expenditures, implement cost reductions and defer payments, which could significantly reduce our overall ability to mitigate cash burn. Likewise, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to defer payments to the same extent as in the past or at all. Furthermore, deferring payment, including on rent in particular, creates future obligations and we cannot provide any assurance that when these deferred payments fall due that our cash outlays will not increase as a result. In addition to the factors listed above, COVID-19 and the measures taken to respond to it have created an environment of uncertainty and rapid, unpredictable changes that exacerbate and magnify certain of the other risks we face. The effect of COVID-19 on our business and the wider fitness industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, the impact of the current resurgence of the virus and the potential for future virus resurgence across the markets in which we operate. There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently estimate this with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Consequently, we have decided to cease operating in Poland. Our Polish subsidiary has applied to the Polish courts to open an insolvency proceeding under Polish bankruptcy laws with the goal of appointing a trustee to oversee the orderly distribution of our Polish assets once the Polish court has approved our application, which we expect to take two months. Insolvency proceedings may involve a number of uncertainties, including as to timing, and we can make no assurances that the insolvency proceedings may not have other negative effects on our overall business, such as negative publicity associated with our decision to wind down the business from the mainstream press or from employees, creditors or other stakeholders.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The data for the months of July, August, September and October 2020 presented herein is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Combined Group’s financial or operational results for the 48 ----- nine month period ended September 30, 2020 and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should not place reliance on them when making an investment decision. We have included data for the months of July, August, September and October 2020 in order to provide information about our recent performance but this information should be treated with a higher level of scepticism for reasons including but not limited to: management accounts are not prepared with the same level of rigor and are not subject to the same level of management review and scrutiny as interim or year-end financial information. Furthermore, management accounts may not provide for closing procedures that are as detailed as those conducted at period or year end, including but not limited to the preparation of accruals, statutory adjustments and true-ups and other closing procedures. Additionally, management accounts may be subject to cut-off errors and misallocation of items between months. Further, the impact of COVID-19 may have further increased the risk of errors or omissions or misstatements in our management accounts due to the reduced level of resources allocated to their preparation due to furlough arrangements. In addition to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with using data derived from management accounts, the impact of COVID-19 has created heightened and unprecedented risks and uncertainties and has resulted in atypical, non-routine transactions and activities, which increase the likelihood that the management accounts for the period, including the data for the months of July, August, September and October 2020 presented below, may not be in line with the financial data we report in our September 2020 interim financial information or at year-end. The atypical and non-routine nature of our business in the context of COVID-19 includes dramatically reduced member revenue, deferment and forbearance of rent payments, receipt of government aid and mitigation moneys, unusually high volumes of gift cards and other offers made to members, which may impact revenue recognition, furthermore, there have been significant fluctuations in our cost base and management have been required to make judgements in relation to non-cash rent adjustments and categorization of exceptional costs. We cannot predict to what extent these atypical, non-routine transactions and activities will impact our business going forward, an uncertainty which is increased by the likelihood of the second lockdown period and further waves of COVID-19 and related lockdowns. This Offering Memorandum also incorporates data that is derived from management's projections. Such forecasts are based on assumptions and these assumptions underlying such internal projections, targets and forecasts are based on our current estimates, perceptions, expectations and intentions, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors such as macro-economic conditions (including the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and future lockdowns) that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance expressed or implied by such assumptions. Further, while we believe that the methodology used to calculate these internal projections, targets and forecasts is reasonable, investors should be aware that there are certain limitations inherent in our ability to accurately predict Adjusted EBITDA and revenues that may be achieved in the future, and that the process of calculating such targets and estimates itself requires the use of other estimates and assumptions, some of which require significant exercise of judgment. Among other things, our internal projections for future periods may be impacted by different estimates and assumptions, macro-economic conditions (including the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and future lockdowns), and other business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and also beyond our control. Additionally, we cannot provide any assurance that during subsequent waves of COVID-19 and lockdowns such government aid, mitigation programs negotiations with landlords and/or protective legislation will be available to the same extent as in the past or at all and, if this were the case, our cash outlay levels would be significantly higher during such subsequent waves than they were in the initial wave, which could materially limit the accuracy and the usefulness of these projections. Our internal projections are forward-looking and, by their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

211,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks relating to our business,13.1.4,"The success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain gym members, while maintaining sustainable and profitable membership fees.","Our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain members to our gyms. We generate almost all of our revenue from membership fees (representing 92% of Pure Gym revenue and 90% of Fitness World revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019). As a result, we must continually engage existing members and attract new members in order to maintain or increase our gym membership levels. In addition, as Pure Gym members do not enter into any fixed-term contracts and Fitness World members have the option to avoid fixedterm contracts if they desire more flexibility; generally, customers can usually terminate their membership with, in the case of Pure Gym, no notice, and in the case of Fitness World, one month’s notice, in each case without penalty. If we are unable to attract and retain gym members, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. One of the most significant factors affecting our ability to attract and retain members is the membership and joining fees we charge. However, we are also dependent on our ability to charge membership and joining fees at a level that both attracts members and generates an appropriate fee yield relative to our costs. While we have certain flexibility on a gym by gym basis to vary the membership fees we charge existing members and the membership and joining fees we can charge to prospective members, our ability to increase such fees to offset potential cost increases while maintaining or increasing membership levels may be limited. Furthermore, we may even need to decrease membership fees or joining fees over time to maintain or increase membership levels. If we cannot sustain profitable membership fees to offset the costs of operating our gyms, we may discontinue operations (for example, see “—We have taken a strategic view to not invest additional Group resources in our _operations in Poland and cannot make assurances regarding the effect of the related insolvency proceedings”)._ If we are unable to maintain or increase such fees as necessary or are forced to decrease such fees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additional factors that could lead to a decline in membership levels, prevent us from increasing membership levels, or negatively affect the fees we can charge members include: - the impact of COVID-19 on our business (See “—The negative impact of COVID-19 on our _business is significant and its effects will continue to materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control”);_ - direct local competition from value and other health and fitness club operators; - saturation of local health and fitness club markets; - harm to our reputation or brand; - a decline in our ability to deliver a high-quality service to our members; - changes in consumer preference away from the value gym offering to gym offerings with more amenities or that offer specialized, trend-driven exercises; - changes in consumer preference away from the value gym offering in favour of centralized online group exercise reservations to a variety of local gyms and specialized studios; - increasing popularity of home fitness equipment, fitness apps and other online exercise programs; - increasing popularity of studio gyms and outdoor fitness activities; - a decline in the public’s interest in health and fitness; - a decline in time available for consumers to pursue leisure activities; - changes in discretionary consumer spending habits due to deterioration of general economic conditions in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland, as well as demographic shifts in these markets; and 50 ----- - changes in the level of positive referrals from current and former members, due to a decline in our ability to deliver high-quality services or from harm to our reputation or brand or other reasons. In order to continue to attract and retain members, we have to be able to respond to consumer sentiment, which may change rapidly and as the result of forces outside our control. For example, during the summer of 2018, high temperatures and a lack of air conditioning in certain Fitness World locations in Denmark led a large number of members to cancel their memberships. If we fail to respond to such changes quickly, we may lose a significant number of members. A decline in membership levels, membership and joining fees and profitability as a result of any of the above factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

As we lease all of our gym sites, we are dependent upon finding and securing new leasehold sites at which to open new gyms. We employ an extensive site selection strategy that incorporates a number of selection criteria such as site size, location, configuration, local population density, demographic characteristics of the local catchment, proximity of transportation networks, availability of car parks and local competitive dynamics, amongst other criteria. Our ability to identify and negotiate financially acceptable lease terms for new sites may be adversely affected by the availability of suitable sites that meet our selection criteria, fluctuations in the property rental market or significant competition for suitable sites from competitors, other commercial enterprises such as retailers, leisure and office space operators and residential operators. As a result, we may be unable to identify suitable sites and secure them at rental prices or on terms acceptable to us, or in a timely manner. If we are unable to secure sufficient sites that meet our selection criteria at acceptable rental prices within the planned roll out timeframe, we may not be able to implement our growth plan. Furthermore, in response to the second lockdown or future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related measures that may be implemented by the governments of the countries in which we operate, we may choose to put our growth strategy on hold either in full or in part. We cannot predict whether, when, where and for how long such lockdown or other measures may be put in place in the future. As a result, we may not be able to implement our growth plan in the short-, mid- or long-term, depending on the nature of such lockdowns and other measures.

We cannot assure you that current locations will continue to be economically viable (for example, see “—We have taken a strategic view _to not invest additional Group resources in our operations in Poland and cannot make assurances regarding the effect of the related insolvency proceedings”). As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations_ may not continue to be attractive and profitable. Decrease in the population of neighbourhoods where our gyms are located or adverse economic conditions in these areas and those surrounding those neighbourhoods could result in reduced revenue in those locations. Furthermore, we may relocate or open gyms in new areas in anticipation of future development, which ultimately may not materialize. Businesses in the UK are required to pay a tax for occupying a property, namely “business rates”. The UK government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property market approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect on April 1, 2017 and the next revaluation is scheduled to come into effect on April 1, 2021. The adjustments of the business rates could result in increased estate costs and consequently could have an adverse effect on the economic viability of certain gyms. Business properties in Denmark are subject to property taxes based on land value (Ejendomsskat). The applicable rates are within a range of 1.6% and 3.4% of the property value and set by the municipality in which the property is located. Currently, the Danish property valuation system is being revised and a new system will likely lead to significant valuation changes for many properties, just as valuations will generally be subject to ongoing adjustments. The property taxes are fully borne by the tenants and adjustments in the tax rates set by the local municipalities as well as changes in property values could have an adverse effect on the economic viability of certain Fitness World gyms. 51 ----- Most properties used for commercial purposes in a majority of the municipalities in Denmark are subject to a service charge (dækningsafgift). The service charge is calculated on a parts per thousand basis (“per mille”) of the difference between the property valuation (ejendomsvurderingen) and the land valuation (grundværdien). The municipality can decide freely on the per mille level in the calculation, however, the maximum is 10 per mille. Historically, the use of commercial properties for fitness purposes has been exempt from such services charges. However, this practice is currently subject to change and some municipalities in Denmark have started imposing service charges on gyms. Most of the current leases of Fitness World are situated in municipalities in Denmark that impose service charges on properties used for commercial purposes. If such municipalities were to take the position that fitness purposes are not exempt from services charges, this change could have an adverse effect on the results of operations of Fitness World gyms situated in such municipalities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

If our gyms do not achieve expected membership levels or membership fees, which has occurred in a percentage of the Mature Gym estate, then the financial performance of the gyms may be negatively impacted, resulting in a lower ROCE. The financial performance and ROCEs of gyms can also be negatively impacted by higher than expected operating, maintenance and property costs, or if such gyms experience higher than expected Initial Capital Investment costs, refurbishment costs and Pre-Opening Costs. We may not be able to recover the capital investment required to develop and operate our gyms. Our expectations for the financial performance and Mature Gym ROCEs of our gyms, including future gyms to be opened, can be influenced by a wide variety of factors such as incorrect analyses of the suitability of sites, future changes in competitive dynamics or higher levels of future cost inflation, amongst numerous others.

211,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks relating to our business,13.1.9,We may face increased risk of litigation following the period in which a rent moratorium or similar governmental measure relating to rent is lifted.,"On March 25, 2020, the UK government implemented the Coronavirus Act 2020 in response to COVID19 and enacted a moratorium on the forfeiture of leased premises due to non-payment of rent by commercial tenants, thereby preventing landlords from carrying out evictions during the COVID-19 crisis (the Coronavirus Act also prevented landlords from using formal Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery processes). The moratorium has been extended twice already and may be extended again beyond December 31, 2020 (in England and Wales) if the government makes the determination that such an extension is necessary, with separate eviction protection measures being undertaken by Northern Ireland and Scotland. The timeframe and conditions for the lifting of this moratorium are uncertain and are outside our control but may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Further protections were put in place by the UK government under the UK Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020. That piece of legislation prevented (in general terms) statutory demands and winding-up petitions filed where financial distress was caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Once the protections offered by these statutes ends, landlords will again be able to use all options available for rent recovery. For example, landlords may forfeit leases or may issue a statutory demand for rent arrears as the precursor to insolvency proceedings. Landlords may also have greater success in terms of commencing court proceedings in order to recover rent or other sums due under the lease. Alternatively, Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery will again allow landlords of commercial premises to take control of and sell the assets on the premises. On March 28, 2020, the Swiss Federal Council adopted the COVID-19 Ordinance relating to rents and leases (SR 221.213.4), thereby prolonging the deadlines landlords could set for rent or lease payments arrears for the period between March 13, 2020 through May 31, 2020. The respective minimum deadlines were extended from 30 days to 90 days in case of rent (Miete) and to at least 120 days in case of leases (Pacht). Within the framework of such extension, landlords continue to have a number of options for rent and lease recovery. For example, landlords may commence debt enforcement or court proceedings in order to recover rent, lease or other sums due in connection therewith, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, on June 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Parliament adopted a resolution which instructs the Swiss Federal Council to develop and propose draft legislation which would entail a up to 60% reduction of rent and lease payments (i) due during the governmental lockdown in connection with COVID-19 and (ii) not exceeding CHF 20,000.00 per month. While the timeframe, conditions and further specifics of such legislation are uncertain and are generally outside of our control, the implementation or nonimplementation of such legislation, which may be subject to a public referendum in Switzerland, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Similar rent moratorium legislation has not been implemented in Denmark. Fitness World has, however, entered into certain agreements with certain of its landlords regarding rent deferrals on various terms and conditions. In an effort to maximize our liquidity position and in line with the approach taken by many other businesses across the UK, Switzerland and Denmark, we entered into discussions with our landlords regarding rent deferrals and are continuing these discussions during the second lockdown period in England, which previously resulted in various rent accommodations across our gym estate during the initial lockdown.

The leases for Pure Gyms generally have upwards-only rent adjustments every five years that are typically in line with the retail prices index (the “RPI”) subject to a 0–2% per annum collar and 3–4% per annum cap. Rent increases for Fitness World gyms are adjusted annually and range between 0.5% and 3%. However, some of our leases have differing terms which include open market rent reviews and fixed rent uplifts. For example, in Denmark, Fitness World leases in shopping centres are subject to Fitness World becoming a member 53 ----- of the centre in which its clubs are located and paying a marketing contribution to the association. Imposition of such further financial obligations with respect to shopping centres are usual in Denmark. If we are unable to increase our revenue by increasing membership levels and/or membership or joining fees or reduce other costs in response to potential future increases in rents and related fees on our sites, then such increasing lease costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The majority of Fitness World’s leases in Denmark are non-terminable for ten years.. Although Fitness World has historically encountered very few difficulties regarding renewal of its leases, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case. If leases are not renewed, we may be required to find alternative sites to operate such gyms. We could incur significant additional costs in identifying and securing suitable alternative sites or may be forced to close gyms in desirable locations if alternative sites cannot be secured. If gyms are closed, we may be unable to attract members from those gyms to our other locations in significant numbers. Such members may cancel their memberships due to, among other reasons, our inability to deliver the services they require in a convenient location for them.

In circumstances where we are unable to terminate our property leases, we may not be able to sublet or assign our leases on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, if we close a gym prior to being able to exercise our tenant-only break right, or prior to the end of the lease term in cases where we do not have a tenant-only break right, we may be obligated to continue to pay rent and incur operating losses at the relevant site, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Our ability to make such acquisitions could be affected by a number of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, competition regulations, general macroeconomic, social and political conditions and available capital. Even if we are successful in acquiring target businesses, we may experience difficulties in integrating targets into our business, may incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize the anticipated benefits. Acquiring new businesses can place significant demands on management, employees, suppliers, systems and resources and can expose us to new or unidentified liabilities. An acquired business also may not perform in line with our expectations at the time of the acquisition. Furthermore, we may not achieve the desired level of revenue or cost synergy benefits on integration of new businesses or gyms and the cost of achieving those benefits may be higher than anticipated. Failure to integrate acquisitions successfully or the manifestation of unexpected liabilities or costs associated with such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Although we typically conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, we can provide no assurance that we will discover all deficiencies, facts or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Additionally, acquisitions may require the approval of governmental or regulatory authorities which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process, resulting in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth.

In particular, disruptions or failures that affect our website, gym access, marketing, billing and other administrative functions could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. While we fully back up all of our membership and business information using third-party locations and have a full business continuity plan in place, any delay or failure on the part of the data back-up provider or in executing our business continuity plan may hinder our ability to resolve information technology system disruptions or failures in a timely and effective manner. Any disruption 55 ----- or failure involving our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any issues, viruses, data inconsistencies, outages, interruptions or security breaches in connection with our information technology systems could cause significant disruption to us, and our members may become dissatisfied if such disruption or failure interrupts our ability to provide our members with access to our gyms or to other services. Member dissatisfaction may cause members to stop using our services, cancel their membership or otherwise generate negative publicity, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Some of our information technology systems, such as our membership management and billing systems, are outsourced to third-party providers. In addition, we periodically update or change our information technology systems. Any disruptions to our information technology systems as a result of a failure by one of our third-party providers, or termination of our relationship with our third-party providers for any reason, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The Group is following a strategy which will see the migration of current systems overtime to a common platform. This platform will be based on the OneCore MMS system which was being developed by Fitness World. Both the development of the OneCore system and the future convergence of systems from Fitness World, PureGym and BaseFit onto the OneCore system could take longer than expected, cost more than expected, and lead to significant business disruption in the future.

Successful penetration of our defences against cyberattack could lead to the loss of member data and the direct costs associated with this as well as broader reputational damage. In connection with the implementation of the GDPR in May 2018, Fitness World engaged an external company to perform a detailed cybersecurity review of its IT infrastructure, software, processes and culture. Risks that were identified were addressed by Fitness World management. Fitness World currently has a dedicated employee responsible for focusing on IT security.

Historically, Pure Gym had a third model in operation, Hours PTs, who were personal trainers who paid an annual license fee and provided 12 hours per week of support time to use Pure Gym facilities to train their clients but our operating model has since evolved and the Hours PT model is no longer a feature of the business (See “Business—Personal trainers—Pure Gym”).

Political crises, such as riots, terrorist attacks, war and other political instability could also disrupt our operations. In the past, we have had to close a small number of gyms temporarily, primarily due to flooding. Currently, a substantial portion of our gym estate is closed due to the second lockdown restrictions in England and partial lockdown restrictions in certain areas of Denmark and Switzerland. Although we continue to monitor developments and consider contingency plans as appropriate, any prolonged closures due to factors outside of our control may adversely affect our results of operations and may also result in longer term reductions in revenue and profitability for a number of reasons, such as termination of memberships by members of the affected gyms.

211,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks relating to the industry,13.2.1,The health and fitness industries in which we are operate are highly competitive and we may fail to compete effectively.,"The health and fitness industries in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland are highly competitive. Competition for provision of health and fitness services is highly localized, and we compete with all local public and private health and fitness operators, gyms and leisure centres offering exercise facilities, including boutique exercise studios. Our competitors have opened and may open further gyms or exercise facilities in the catchment areas of our existing or planned gyms. Competitors, which may be new or existing operators, including companies that have greater resources or greater name recognition than us, may compete to attract members in our current or prospective markets. Nonprofit organizations and local authorities in our markets may be able to obtain land and construct gyms at a lower cost and may be able to collect membership fees without paying taxes or receive preferential VAT treatment, thereby allowing them to potentially charge lower prices. Due to the increasing number of value gyms in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland, we may face increased direct competition in the value segment of the market, especially if the operators of such value gyms charge lower membership prices than us or gain access to significant amounts of capital to enable them to rapidly build new sites. In addition, because we do not have exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-gym experience and service offering, competitors may attempt to copy or improve on our business model, or portions thereof, which could erode our competitive position, market share and brand recognition and adversely affect our prospects. There is also a risk that traditional mid-market and premium health and fitness club operators may change their models and lower prices or create lower price brand alternatives to more effectively compete with us. In addition, individuals wishing to exercise have a wide variety of options available to them other than using purpose-built health and fitness facilities. These include engaging in outdoor activities such as cycling, running and group exercise programs, participating in other sports (including team sports) or using exercise machines or weights, fitness apps or other online programs at home. Increased competition in the health and fitness industry could result from new market entrants or existing operators expanding their operations or lowering their prices, including operators who have traditionally participated in the mid-market and premium segment, particularly large multi-facility operators that are able to compete for attractive property opportunities. Some competitors may have lower fixed or variable costs, or have lower ROCE expectations than us, which means that they may be able to offer lower membership fees for equivalent services. We also face competition from operators offering comparable or higher pricing in conjunction with higher levels of service and other amenities. For example, in Denmark, we are facing intense competition from Fitness X (formerly Fitness 1), who have in recent months been significantly increasing the number of clubs they operate in spite of the COVID-19 situation, with a large number of members per club as compared to our other Danish competitors and who employ a low-cost model that features low subscription costs at a variety of price points. We also face increased competition in Switzerland from the Cleverfit brand, who are increasing their presence in the value market and who operate some locations that are close to some of our Basefit locations. Both of these brands currently feature a similar product offering to us but at a lower price point, which could limit our ability to attract and retain members. In response to competition, our business may from time to time make certain pricing, service, sales and marketing or capital decisions that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot compete adequately, our growth strategy as well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Alternative forms of fitness or venues for fitness may become popular and trends in the type of gyms that consumers wish to join may change in the future. Changes in consumer preferences that could affect us include, for example, a preference for in-home exercise, team sports, outdoor fitness activities or studio-based group exercises. 63 ----- There may also be a change in the public’s perception of the general benefits of exercise, which could lead to less demand for gyms. In addition, the development of pharmaceutical drugs that lead to weight loss may impact overall demand for our product. If we are unable to anticipate and adapt to consumer preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to adapt our services on a timely basis, we may lose members, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

For example, on June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the UK opted to withdraw from the EU in a national referendum and on January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the European Union (“Brexit”). The UK is currently in a transition period following its formal withdrawal from the European Union. Depending on the outcome of negotiations during the transition period, the UK could lose access to the single European Union market, which could result, among other things, in the disruption of the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the European Union or other nations as the UK pursues independent trade relations. This could have an impact on the general and economic conditions in the UK, which will directly adversely affect the financial condition of our members. These developments, as well as any other adverse developments in macroeconomic conditions in the UK, Denmark or Switzerland or the perception that any of them could occur, may result in the lower availability of credit, higher interest rates and tax rates, increased unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, lower consumer confidence, lower wage and salary levels, inflation or the public perception that any of these conditions may occur, could adversely impact demand for gym memberships in the countries in which we operate. Membership of a gym may be viewed as a non-essential item and, in times of economic uncertainty or recession, members of gyms may terminate or suspend their membership. Macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties may also impact our suppliers in ways that would adversely affect our business and results of operations, including supplier closures or increases in the costs of products or services they supply. Lower levels of future economic growth, or any deterioration in the economy or any of the factors mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks relating to the regulatory environment,13.3.1,We could be subject to material fines and claims related to health and safety risks at our gyms.,"Physical exercise and the use of our gym services and facilities, including exercise equipment, poses potential health and safety risks, including serious injury or death, to members, employees and third party contractors. For example, water hygiene problems could develop in our changing facilities that may cause a potential health risk to members and employees, or an accident on the gym floor involving fitness equipment could result in injury or death. We are also reliant on CCTV to ensure health and safety during unmanned hours at our gyms and this technology may fail on occasion. We may be subject to material claims asserted against us for any injury or death suffered by someone using our facilities or services. We might not be able to successfully defend such claims and we may be liable for fines, damages and costs in excess of, or outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Even with adequate insurance, such claims may cause significant damage to our reputation and may have a material impact on our ability to attract or retain members. Additionally, these risks are heightened by the COVID-19 situation and the expected reopening following the second lockdown period. Following the reopening of our gyms after the initial lockdown, we took extensive measures to protect our members and our workforce, including our key management and our cleaning and technical personnel, in order to minimize their exposure to COVID-19. However, going forward, we cannot be certain that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 and we may be subject to potential litigation as a result of members or our personnel who contract, or believe they have contracted, the virus at our gyms. We may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. We may also be at risk of litigation following a possible outbreak at one of our gyms, which may cause us to incur further significant costs and which may have a negative impact on our reputation. Any such fines or claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 64 ----- Our operations and gyms are subject to various laws, regulations and planning and licensing regimes, including in-person marketing, licensing, signage planning, advertising standards and noise abatement requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users, including tenants, of sites for the clean-up of contamination at, or arising from, such sites, without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. For example, we have historically incurred costs for remedial actions when asbestos was discovered at a number of gyms. Although we are not aware of any material actual or pending liabilities, claims or actions relating to contamination of any of our current sites, future investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that we are required to remedy or damage that may subject us to claims or regulatory proceedings. A breach of environmental regulations, standards relating to health and safety or marketing and advertising or other applicable standards could potentially lead to the mandatory closure of a gym or multiple gyms for a period of time. We may also be subject to claims by members and other visitors alleging exposure to potentially harmful substances that may be present within our gym sites. We may not be able to successfully defend against such claims or regulatory proceedings or our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the costs of such claims. Any such actions may also lead to negative publicity for us and adversely affect our ability to attract new and retain existing members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. New laws, regulations and licensing regimes or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those relating to environmental protection, health and safety, labour and employment, tax, competition, consumer protection, marketing and advertising practices, privacy and information security, may require extensive system and/or operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our operating expenses or subject us to additional costs, fines or other penalties. For example, a change in the VAT or other tax regimes applicable, or the application thereof, to our business may result in uncertainty, disruption to operations and implementation costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. Compliance with, or any violation of, current and future laws, regulations or licensing regimes could require material expenditures by us, expose us to government enforcement action and claims by members or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

We also maintain a large membership database made up of prospective, current and former members. This data could be an attractive target for cyber-attack by malicious third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled current or former employees and others. We are focused on protection of member and employee data given these risks. Furthermore, our processing of personal data is subject to numerous laws, regulations and standards related to the protection of personal data, including, among others, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and is supplemented under UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 (“UKDPA”), which replaced the former UK Data Protection Act 1998, and under Danish law by the Danish Data Protection Act (“DDPA”), which replaced the former Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data. The GDPR, UKDPA and DDPA altogether set out more onerous and stringent requirements for controllers and processors’ processing of personal data, including expanded disclosure requirements. For example, when collecting personal data, certain information must be provided to the individual whose data is being collected. This information includes the identity of the data controller, the purpose for which the data is being collected and other relevant information relating to the processing. In some cases, the consent of those data subjects may also be required to protect the personal data for the purposes notified to them. Personal data may only be used for the purposes notified to individuals. Additionally, regulators now have the ability to impose larger fines of up to the greater of €20 million (approximately £17 million) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year. In addition to fines, regulators also have the ability to impose other sanctions such as injunctions and other prohibitive orders. We use a third party based in the U.S. for marketing purposes, which may involve the processing of our member data, and thus, we are also subject to the EU laws on data export. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms for the transfer of data to and from our EU business to the United States, and could be impacted by further changes in law as a result of the current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts. For example in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S., while the validity of EU Standard Contractual Clauses is currently being 65 ----- challenged before the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-311/18, Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (“Schrems II”). Even though the U.S. and EU negotiators agreed to a new framework in February 2016 called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the European Commission issued an adequacy decision on the framework in July 2016, the framework is currently being challenged in case T738/16, La Quadrature du Net and others v. Commission (“La Quadrature du Net”). The hearing on La Quadrature du Net has been suspended until the CJEU renders a final judgment on Schrems II, hence there can be no assurance that future litigation and new agreements will not impact our business or results of operations. We also use cookies and similar technologies for online behavioural advertising. In the UK, Denmark and the European Union in general, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device (except for strictly necessary cookies). The ePrivacy Directive as implemented into national legislation covers the use of cookies and similar technology and direct marketing are under reform. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to even broader restrictions on our research activities, including efforts to understand user Internet usage and attract prospective users. Such regulations may increase the costs for collecting or using online usage information, increase regulatory scrutiny and increase the potential for civil liability under consumer protection laws. Similarly, changes to direct marketing rules may also have a significant effect on how we market to prospective and current members. Compliance with evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models and the development of new administrative processes. Although we monitor the changes in law in this regard closely and make an effort to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance at all times, and this could lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Despite the security measures we have in place to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, cyber fraud, programming and human errors or other personal data breaches and similar events. A breach of data protection legislation involving the unlawful processing, misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal data, including the use of such information for direct marketing purposes, whether by us, one of our sub-contractors or service providers or an unrelated party, could result in regulatory action, compensation claims, fines of £17 million (€20 million) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, potential loss of business and adverse publicity.

Compliance with and future changes to relevant planning laws and building regulations, or the requirement to pay increased regulatory rates and taxes, could restrict or delay our expansion plans or increase our costs. In addition, when modernizing, refurbishing or expanding existing gyms or opening new gyms, we may require change of use or planning consents from local authorities.

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business”. If cash generated by our subsidiaries is insufficient, we may need to draw on our Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility to make interest payments on the Notes and the Existing Notes.

If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business obligations, activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our indebtedness. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture and the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

The Issuer’s material liabilities will include the Notes, the Existing Notes obligations under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, liabilities under the Subordinated Shareholder Funding and any additional debt it may incur in the future. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, loans, interest and payments on intercompany loans to meet its obligations. Similarly, certain Guarantors are holding companies and will be wholly dependent upon arrangements with their respective subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of the subsidiaries of the Issuer to make cash distributions or dividends. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. The ability of the direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances, including payments on intercompany loans, will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and, in some cases, receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or 68 ----- distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes. Pursuant to the Danish Companies Act (Consolidated Act No. 763 of 23 July 2019 as amended, _selskabsloven), the ability of the Danish Guarantors and other direct and indirect Danish subsidiaries of the Issuer_ to make dividends to assist in servicing the Notes and other debt will be subject to certain restrictions, including (i) that the relevant Danish company has sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay the proposed dividend; and (ii) that the board of directors of the relevant Danish company considers that the amount of the proposed dividend is appropriate having regard to the financial position of the relevant Danish company and its subsidiaries. In addition, there are further limitations on the ability of the Danish Guarantors and other direct and indirect Danish subsidiaries of the Issuer to make dividends to assist in servicing the Notes and other debt as a result of government aid received in connection with COVID-19. Fitness World A/S has received DKK 110 million (£13.4 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1792 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) in compensation for fixed costs under the Danish fixed cost compensation scheme enacted in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Pursuant to Danish Executive Order No. 574 of 5 May 2020 regarding compensation for fixed costs to businesses in financial crisis due to COVID-19, as amended, it is a condition to the receipt of compensation for fixed costs in excess of DKK 60 million (£7.3 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1792 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) that the recipient company does not complete a capital reduction for financial years 2020 and 2021, including by way of payment of dividends and/or buy-back of the company's own shares. Accordingly, Fitness World A/S is prohibited from paying out any dividends for financial years 2020 and 2021, unless Fitness World A/S repays the fixed cost compensation received in excess of DKK 60 million. This prohibition is not limited to the amount of fixed cost compensation received.

In certain jurisdictions, including England and Wales and Denmark, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

Creditors under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (and counterparties under certain hedging agreements, if any) will receive the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes. Upon a refinancing of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, or if the lenders under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement consent to an increase of the commitments under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or if we exercise our right to incur additional priority debt and/or hedging obligations, the amount that will benefit from super priority interests in the Collateral may be increased, subject to the limits imposed under the Indenture, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking _pari passu_ with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your direct and indirect rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the super-priority debt secured by the Collateral, an increase in obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the Offering. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers, whether any approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a potential buyer and similar factors. Hence, 71 ----- the amount to be received upon a sale of any Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, general market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of the sale. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be sellable and, even if sellable, the timing of any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By the nature of our business, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Also, certain of our contracts, including the Indenture and the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, include a change of control clause, which may be triggered by enforcement of Collateral and limit the value of the Collateral. In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under the Notes. If the proceeds of any enforcement (including, where applicable, a sale) of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral), you would only have a senior unsecured claim against the Issuer’s remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favour of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral, such as certain pre-existing or statutory liens. Holders of such other secured indebtedness may have rights and remedies which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super senior indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under super senior indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Existing Notes, any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes and certain non-priority hedging obligations. 72 ----- The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, the hedging obligations which are permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Existing Notes, the holders of the Notes and the creditors of any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the Existing Indenture and the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

A change of control may result in an obligation to make an offer to purchase the Existing Notes, or the acceleration or mandatory prepayment of the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes or Guarantees if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests or if such perfection is not required at all under the Security Documents or is only required after the occurrence of certain events. Any failure to properly and timely perfect any security interest in the Collateral in accordance with applicable law may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or the holder of the security interest having difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. 74 ----- In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property and equipment, only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. None of the Trustee or the Security Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. Granting of security subject to Danish law could be set aside under Danish insolvency laws if, among other things, (i) security for the debts was not granted to the creditor before or at the time the debt was incurred; or (ii) security was not perfected before, or without undue delay after, the time when the debt was incurred. These timing requirements in respect of granting of security and perfection of security are interpreted very strictly under Danish law. In such situations, security could be set aside if it has not been perfected no less than three months prior to the date on which the bankruptcy court receives the petition for bankruptcy proceedings (the “reference date”) and in some cases avoidance can be claimed even for security granted and perfected before. If the security is granted to related parties, the voidance period is extended to two years. Voidance is a real risk in respect of Collateral subject to Danish law.

The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Danish Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under Danish law. Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have priority. The Danish Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate an enforcement action in respect of such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to take enforcement action in respect of those assets, and the value of the Danish Collateral may significantly decrease.

However, the security interest granted by a Swiss Guarantor under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest, and the Indenture governing the Notes will provide that each guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a Swiss Guarantor, without rendering the relevant guarantee and security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under the laws of Switzerland, and enforcement of such guarantee and security interest may be subject to certain generally available defences.

These limitations principally arise under provisions or principles of corporate law relating to (i) financial assistance and (ii) corporate benefit considerations pursuant to which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee on account of a direct or indirect parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Danish Guarantor’s perspective. If these limitations are not observed, the Guarantees by the Danish Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In order for a Danish company to provide a guarantee or security in relation to another group company’s debt, it is a general requirement under Danish law that the Danish company obtains an adequate corporate benefit from such guarantee or security. This is related to the general duty of the board of directors and the management board of a Danish company to act responsibly (forsvarligt) and to ensure a proper management of the company’s assets. Further, the board of directors and the management board must always act in the best interests of the Danish company’s individual interest. When assessing whether it is in the Danish company’s best interest to guarantee or secure another group company’s debt, the board of directors and the management board should consider all relevant circumstances, including (i) the company’s financial position, capital and liquidity resources, (ii) the benefits that the company will obtain from providing the guarantee or security, (iii) the potential risks related to providing the guarantee or security, including an assessment of the credit rating of the principal debtor, and (iv) securing that the arrangement is on arms’ length terms. If sufficient corporate benefit is not obtained, among others, the guarantee or security may be null and void. It is not clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit can be established when a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company. In accordance with applicable Danish law, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed so that applicable Danish law restrictions will not be violated. To comply with the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions, any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries (whether or not incorporated in Denmark, thus including Basefit.ch 77 ----- AG) will be deemed not to be so granted and limited if and to the extent required to comply with the provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation, as set out in Sections 206-212 of the Danish Companies Act. In addition, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors will be subject to a fixed cap as determined by the board of directors of the relevant Danish Guarantor. Any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor will be subject to a fixed cap of DKK 150 million (£18.4 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1316 to £1.000 as of September 18, 2020) with respect to Fitness World Group A/S and a fixed cap of DKK 185 million (£22.8 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1316 to £1.000 as of September 18, 2020) with respect to Fitness World A/S (together, the ""Danish **Guarantee Caps""). The Danish Guarantee Caps will apply on an aggregate basis with respect to any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor in respect of the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Danish Guarantor, your claims may be severely limited or even reduced to zero. In addition, the Danish Guarantors are also borrowers and/or guarantors under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Whilst the above-mentioned guarantee limitations are also included in the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, they may not apply to the same extent to borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as they do to the Notes due to different application of such borrowings and the proceeds of the Notes. Accordingly, the ability of the lenders under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to recover from the Danish Guarantors the amount of loans made under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may be superior to the ability of the holders of the Notes to enforce the Guarantees of any of those Danish Guarantors.

Under certain applicable laws, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Security Agent will have the benefit of so-called parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The security documents governed by the laws of the Switzerland will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents and those holders of the notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the collateral). As a result, the holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In Switzerland, there is no statutory law or case law available on the validity or enforceability of the parallel debt construct or the security provided for such parallel debt. However, notwithstanding this uncertainty, we have been advised that there are no reasons why the Parallel Debt will not create a claim of the pledgee (the Security Agent) thereunder which can be validly secured by security interests. To the extent the Parallel Debt construct would be successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral in the relevant jurisdiction.

If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected and, accordingly, the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of any investment in the Notes. Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as economic climate, public health concerns, levels of discretionary spending, ability to attract and retain gym members, risks relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.

We believe that the Combined Group has strong growth prospects and common core competencies, including shared market leadership positions in the UK and Denmark, an inclusive philosophy, a modern technology-enabled customer offer based on high-quality, affordable gyms that can be accessed on a flexible basis, and a strong platform for expansion. Our vision is to provide affordable, flexible, and “value-for-money” memberships to high-quality gyms to all people who want to increase their level of fitness, as demonstrated by our inclusive “everybody welcome” philosophy. In response to COVID-19, governments globally (including within the markets in which we operate) have implemented strict social distancing measures, including varied approaches to lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including ours. COVID-19 presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our industry. We believe that we have taken and are taking appropriate actions in response to COVID-19 in line with relevant government guidance and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage our business, control our cost base and protect our operating cash flows. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact of _COVID-19”. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to accurately predict the short-,_ medium- or long-term impacts of COVID-19 on our business and our industry. 93 ----- Our strategic mission continues to be providing affordable and flexible memberships to high-quality fitness facilities balanced against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. Upon our acquisition of Fitness World, we were the market-leading operator in the Danish market, with a growing presence in Switzerland and amongst value operators in Europe, were number two by number of sites value operator in Europe and number three by revenue and member numbers. We believe that the strategic rationale for the acquisition of Fitness World remains intact for the long-term despite the significant immediate challenges faced in a COVID-19 world. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived 57% of our revenue from our operations in the UK, 36% from our operations in Denmark, 6% from operations in Switzerland and 1% from our operations in Poland. Our key geographic markets are the UK and Denmark and as such, Pure Gym and Fitness World will continue operating under their existing brand names in these key markets. As of December 31, 2019, the Combined Group operated 504 gyms in cities and towns across the four countries, with Pure Gym accounting for 52% of clubs and Fitness World accounting for 48% of clubs, and had approximately 1.7 million members in total. The table below displays the key European gym operators by number of members: (‘000 Members) (1) Source: Company information and Deloitte/EuropeActive Report.

(3) Pure Gym, Fitness World and The Gym Group data is as of December 2019; Basic-Fit data is as of Q3 2019. Members of other operators are as per latest estimates included in the Deloitte/EuropeActive Report. Fitness World is a good strategic fit for Pure Gym due to its aligned low-cost operating model. The Combined Group is the third largest operator in Europe by membership and the second largest by number of gyms. With leading market positions in the UK and Denmark and as the second largest player in Switzerland, the Combined Group is a market-leading European value gym operator with diversification and scale benefits. Our disruptive customer value proposition, differentiated business model and well-managed growth strategy has allowed us to grow rapidly.

211,Offerings 2020.md,519,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF PURE GYM,519.2,Significant factors affecting our results of operations,519.2.1,,"This section discusses key factors that we believe have had a material effect on Pure Gym’s results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition in the future. _Impact of COVID-19 The discussion below incorporates data for the months of July 2020 and August 2020 that are derived from preliminary results and estimates contained in our management accounts, which have not been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards and are subject to change._ 95 ----- _The data for the months of July 2020 and August 2020 presented below is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Combined Group’s financial or operational results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2020 and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should not place reliance on them when making an investment decision. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation. In addition to the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with using data derived from management accounts, the impact of COVID-19 during the current quarter has created heightened and unprecedented risks and uncertainties and has resulted in atypical, non- routine transactions and activities, which increase the likelihood that the management accounts for the period, including the data for the months of July 2020 and August 2020 presented below, may not be in line with the financial data we report in our September 2020 interim financial information or at year-end. For more information about the risks associated with the use of data derived from management accounts and the heightened risks in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, see “Risk Factors—The unaudited financial data and projections included herein need to be carefully considered and incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results”. The discussion below also incorporates data that is derived from management's projections. By their nature, projections are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and are based on a number of assumptions that are themselves subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. As such, you should not place reliance on forward-looking statements when making an investment decision. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”._ We had a strong start to the 2020 financial year. In addition to the acquisition of Fitness World, we had a strong trading performance in January and February and combined group membership numbers peaked at 1.9 million as of February 29, 2020. However, in March 2020, the governments of the countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19 and, in doing so, necessitated the temporary closure of all of our gyms (the “lockdown period”) until restrictions could be lifted. When lockdowns occurred, our overall approach was to place members on “free freeze” and as a result almost all our revenues ceased. Some revenues were received during closure periods in Fitness World Denmark as a result of offers made to members and, in the UK, a small amount of revenue was secured from the PureGym Together product. However, in aggregate, almost all of our revenue effectively ceased until the phased reopening of our gyms began. The Group had a strong year in 2019 and a robust start to 2020, both of which enabled us to enter the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial strength; however, the spread of COVID-19 and the prolonged shutdown of our gym estate has had a material negative impact on our business. During the initial lockdown period, we acted swiftly to minimize our cash burn. The business entered lockdown from a position of real strength, which gives us confidence that our core product and proposition was performing well and resonating strongly with members. As expected, our trading performance was severely impacted in the last two weeks of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter of 2020. Prior to the initial lockdown period, net average cash outflow for the Combined Group was £9 million per week on an unmitigated basis, consisting of £8 million in operating cash cost and £1 million in interest cash cost per week. As a result of our cost-cutting strategies, cash-saving measures, revenue initiatives and access to government initiatives, the Combined Group’s liquidity declined by only £18 million throughout the 14-week closure period from March 23, 2020 to June 26, 2020. This primarily consisted of £11 million of payments in relation to capital expenditures (being projects completed prior to the lockdown period) and £7 million of interest payments that fell due during the period. The Combined Group therefore effectively reduced, deferred or offset all of its unmitigated £8 million weekly operating cash cost burden during this 14-week lockdown period. Of the £8 million unmitigated weekly operating cash cost, £4 million was saved through a combination of reducing operating costs, landlord forbearance and assistance received from governments (furlough monies, fixed overhead compensation and rates relief), £2.0 million (comprising £2.5 million of deferred payments net of £0.5 million of receipts) has been deferred into the second half of 2020 and £2 million has been offset through various revenue and other cash collection activities. The second half of 2020 and 2021 will inevitably see increased cash outflows 96 ----- as deferred payments are settled and interest payments are made as they fall due and management’s plan takes this into account. For more information about the risks associated with the impact of the current and subsequent waves of COVID-19 and current and future lockdowns on our ability to minimize cash burn, see “Risk Factors— _The negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is significant and its effects will continue to materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control”._ We also benefited from our geographic diversification during the initial reopening following the initial lockdown period, with a range of reopening dates: Switzerland (11 May), Poland (6 June), Denmark (11 June), Northern Ireland (10 July), England (25 July) and Wales (10 August). The health and wellbeing of our members and staff remains of paramount importance and we are fully engaged to ensure that our gyms, when open, are a safe place to work and a safe place to work out. We have implemented new standards and protocols which are being put in place across the industry. These measures, including personal sanitization, capacity limits, social distancing and abundant cleaning facilities, reduce the risk of transmission for members attending a gym and for our colleagues who work in them. We believe that our approach to variable pricing and capacity management – which is currently best developed in the UK estate – places us well to optimize our value proposition. For example, during the initial reopening, across 274 gyms in the UK, capacity limits ranged from 37 members to 197 members. We track gym capacity, which is set by gym and which can be changed in real-time. We use a data-led approach to manage capacity, leveraging our understanding of usage trends by gym and space allocation and work out station volumes, as well as member feedback. There are a number of levers in addition to club capacity limit that are available to us to help us manage capacity, including number of stations available, hours, classes offered, off-peak product and our booking system. Decisions relating to capacity management in the UK, where COVID-19 related restrictions are currently tightest, are based on daily performance reviews at the gym level. Additionally, we employ a COVID-19 risk monitoring tool as the basis for twice-weekly risk assessments in the UK and weekly risk assessments in Denmark. This risk monitoring tool is based on daily public testing data provided by government sources in the UK and Denmark, uses risk parameters and methodologies set out by the German Public Health Institute (The Koch Institute) and assesses each individual site for risk based on the local area and the specific location of each individual member. This allows management to target additional safety measures (for members and for our team members) and we believe it gives us early warnings of where local lockdowns may come into force. This tool is coupled with industry-wide (UK and European) data covering member visits, EHO visits, infected member/staff incidence and transmission incidence, which provides a coherent data set for discussions with local and national governments to explain why gyms should remain open in the event of further lockdowns. Member feedback on our first reopening was positive and translated to positive member trends in likefor-like member volumes as well as gym visits, particularly among the younger member demographic which displayed a greater propensity to return to the gym. This initial membership trend continued in the UK, where our median member age is below that of our gyms in Denmark and Switzerland: the UK business has the youngest demographic mix in the group (median member age is 28 in the UK, 30 in Denmark and 31 in Switzerland). As at October 18, 2020, we had approximately 1.6 million closing members across the Combined Group, which represents like-for-like members versus membership levels at the same point in 2019 of 80% in the UK, 90% in Denmark and 93% in Switzerland and there have been no confirmed reports of COVID-19 transmission in our gyms reported after more than 26 million visits since reopening. Member visits in the UK increased to 86% in late October, as compared to the same point in 2019. In August 2020, like-for-like average revenue per member was higher than August 2019, with an increase of 3% in the UK and 7% in Denmark. Despite the extended closure period due to mandated government lockdown measures in the countries in which we operate, our business returned to profitability in August and September 2020 following the reopening of the UK estate, with gyms in both Switzerland and Denmark returning to profitability in the month of their reopening. The charts below show the resilience of our business model as evidenced by our rapid return to profitability in August and September following initial lockdown period in the countries in which we operate. 97 ----- While the trend observed in August and September 2020 demonstrated our resilience at that point in time, there can be no assurance that our recovery following subsequent lockdowns would be comparably robust. Overall, as of November 9, 2020 253 (49%) of our sites were open: - **UK: All 236 of our sites in England are currently shut down as a result of the national lockdown that went into effect on November 5, 2020. Our 38 sites across Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland remain open, with the sites in Wales having been closed for two weeks until November 9, 2020, due to the Welsh “fire-break” lockdown. More broadly, PureGym continues to collate and share evidence with national, regional and local authorities that indicates that gyms are relatively low-risk environments and make a strong positive contribution to public health. - **Denmark: 179 out of 185 Fitness World gyms remain open. On October 23, 2020, the Danish government announced new COVID-19 restrictions which have an impact on the operation of gyms such as Fitness World, including for example restrictions on group exercise classes of more than 10 people and requirement to wear a face mask when entering, exiting or staying in a gyms lounge, although not while exercising). These changes may have an impact on member satisfaction and member numbers. In addition, on November 5, 2020, the Danish government announced a number of COVID-19 related restrictions and measures in the area of Northern Jutland following the discovery of a mutated coronavirus referred to as “Cluster 5”, which is believed to spread from minks to humans. Consequently, the Northern Jutland region has been placed on partial lockdown and Fitness World has closed six gyms in the area as a result of the restrictions. The partial lockdown is currently in effect until December 3, 2020, however, there is a risk that it could be extended or that further regional lockdowns, closures or restrictions could be imposed. The Danish government continues to focus on local and sector specific containment measures The management team continue to monitor the situation carefully and are ready to react to regulatory changes. - **Switzerland: 36 out of 39 of our gyms in Switzerland remain open; viral infection rates are on par with the UK and we were informed on October 23, 2020 that one canton (Bern) would be instituting a local lockdown which required closure of three gyms. Management will continue to monitor the situation carefully across Switzerland. - **Poland: our 19 gyms in Poland were closed on October 17, 2020 as part of a range of measures instituted by the national government to stem rising virus rates. The effect of COVID-19 on our business and the wider fitness industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. In this Offering Memorandum, we present financial and other operating data as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to its usefulness as regards our historical performance, this data represents the ordinary course operations of our business before the Acquisition and before the impact of COVID-19. We have 98 ----- also presented financial and other operating data as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020, which include the results of the Fitness World Group from January 14, 2020 and which represent the impact on our business of the Acquisition and COVID-19. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations will differ in respect of the current year and for future periods, when compared to the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion. For additional detail, see “Summary—Recent Developments—Impact _of COVID-19”. IFRS 16 (Leases)_ With respect to the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements, Pure Gym applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method, for transition and measuring right of use assets using the retrospective calculation, both as defined by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. Cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard was therefore recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. The 2017 Topco Financial Statements and the 2018 Topco Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or Pure Gym EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. See Note 27 “Change in Accounting Policies” of the 2019 Pure Gym Financial Statements. _Roll out of Pure Gyms_ New gym openings have been a significant driver of our growth during the periods under review and our roll out strategy has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations. We opened 22 gyms in 2017, 30 gyms in 2018 and 41 gyms in 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the estate increased by 241 gyms as a result of the Fitness World acquisition in January 2020 and by six gyms as a result of organic openings (four in the UK and two in Switzerland). Prior to lockdown, a further eight organic Pure Gym sites were developed in the UK and were ready for opening, all of which have now opened post-period end. We have not closed or relocated any organic gyms in the UK during the period, however as part of an estate optimization plan in Denmark, three Fitness World gyms were closed, with members successfully migrated – in the main – to alternative nearby gyms within our estate. The chart below shows the member levels of seven recently opened UK gyms as compared to our targeted average. 99 ----- Source: Management data; OC&C analysis. 1. Bank has been excluded as it is a London city centre gym. _Pre-opening period_ Prior to opening, each new Pure Gym typically undergoes a two to three-month long pre-opening period following commencement of the lease. During this period, construction of the gym is completed, a significant amount of marketing is conducted and discounted membership offers are typically made to attract new members. Pre-Opening Costs during the pre-opening period averaged £85,000 per New Gym opened in the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a post-IFRS 16 basis) and largely consisted of staff costs and marketing expenses. The impact of IFRS 16 was to reduce average pre-opening costs during the period by £37,000 being rent expense that would otherwise have been charged to the income statement on an IAS 17 basis. _Maturity profile_ Once a new Pure Gym opens, its membership base generally increases rapidly in the first three to six months eventually reaching mature levels after approximately 24 months. Revenue per member also increases as members who join following opening typically pay higher monthly membership fees than those on pre-opening offers. Growth in revenue per member is also supported by the expiration of pre-opening offers, which generally terminate between three and 12 months after opening, when members who remain on these offers receive an automatic price uplift. Together, these factors typically drive increases in revenue and result in growth in Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA as a significant proportion of gym operating and property costs are fixed. We categorize a gym as a Mature Gym at the end of its second year of operation, as a gym’s EBITDA tends to be substantially mature after 24 months, whereas during the first 24 months we usually see an increase in EBITDA. Typically, a gym’s third year is the first full year during which it delivers an annual Mature Gym EBITDA. For example, we consider a gym that opened in August 2017 a Mature Gym for the year ended December 31, 2019, although its EBITDA tends to stabilize after August 2019. Accordingly, the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 would be the first full financial year during which that gym delivers an annual Mature Gym EBITDA. 100 ----- The following table shows selected financial information for the UK Mature Gym portfolio for year ended December 31, 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, 92% of Pure Gym revenue was attributable to membership fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, 92% and 91% of Pure Gym revenue was attributable to membership fees, respectively. Accordingly, our revenue is significantly dependent on membership volumes. Membership volumes are affected by numerous factors, including the total number of Pure Gyms in operation, the prices our gyms charge, the sizes and locations of our gyms, competitive dynamics in the value gym market and seasonality, amongst others. Pure Gym membership has grown substantially from approximately 927,000 as of December 31, 2017 to approximately 1,135,000 as of December 31, 2019. This growth has been driven primarily by the opening of new gyms, the maturation of recent openings, and the acquisition of Ovalhouse Limited (trading as Soho Gyms) in 2018. As at June 30, 2020, membership for the Combined Group was 1,697,000, of which 1,128,000 is attributable to Pure Gyms and 560,000 to the gyms in the Fitness World group. The following table shows certain membership information for different categories of our gym portfolios for the periods indicated.

The majority of site operating costs are controlled_ centrally and senior management is focused on leveraging scale and implementing other initiatives to control costs and improve efficiencies. Site operating costs, other than property costs, are generally consistent across all Pure Gyms and do not typically vary significantly between gyms. Accordingly, site operating costs as a percentage of revenue for a Mature Gym are substantially lower than for a New Gym. For the year ended December 31, 2019, site operating costs, including depreciation, as a percentage of revenue for our 192 Mature Gyms was 58.5% as compared to 61.8% for all of our gyms. 102 ----- The following table sets out our gym site operating costs for the UK Mature Gym portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019 on a post-IFRS 16 basis.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Average Revenue per Member per Month increased from £18.00 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to £18.90 for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely as a result of both increased membership fees and additional charges for value-added options that we offer such as premium memberships (See _Business— _Members—Membership Offerings—Pure Gym). In the six months ended June 30, 2020, Average Revenue per_ Member per Month decreased to £11.20 for the Combined Group due to the COVID-19 closure impact. For an increased monthly fee, Pure Gym’s members can choose to upgrade to a premium membership option. This allows access to additional gyms and provides members with a number of additional benefits, for example, the ability to book classes earlier than standard members and four guest passes a month. We started offering these premium membership options in late 2016, and as of December 31, 2019, 23% of our members are on a premium product. Due to the effect of pre-opening offers, Average New Gym Revenue per Member per Month is initially lower than Average Mature Gym Revenue per Member per Month.

Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditures also increased over the same period due to the growing portfolio of gyms. We maintain a comprehensive maintenance and refurbishment program for our gyms, with initial and ongoing capital expenditures consisting of expenses in relation to equipment, fixtures and fittings, IT and leasehold costs. We estimate that a Pure Gym will generally be fully refurbished within six to eight years of opening at a cost of approximately £0.6 million per gym, and this cost will typically be phased in over the sixth to eighth years following opening. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the estate increased by 241 gyms as a result of the Fitness World acquisition in January 2020 and by six gyms as a result of organic openings (four in the UK and two in Switzerland). Prior to lockdown, a further eight organic Pure Gym sites were developed in the UK and were ready for opening, all of which have now opened post-period end. We have not closed or relocated any organic gyms in the UK during the period. As part of an estate optimization plan in Denmark, three Fitness World gyms were closed, with members successfully migrated – in the main – to alternative nearby gyms within our estate. As a part of our cash preservation measures taken in response to COVID-19, all capital expenditure on scheduled refurbishment was paused and only essential maintenance works were carried out. Each of our Pure Gyms generally require approximately £25,000 to £30,000 of capital investment on an annual basis for maintenance, incorporating some minor enhancements. This maintenance expenditure, in addition to the scheduled site refurbishments, is expected to resume in 2021. In 2020, we have so far opened 19 new gyms (12 in the UK, of which two were SBF gyms, five in Denmark and two in Poland). We do not plan to open any further new gyms before 2021. The Initial Capital Investment for each Pure Gym is estimated to be on average £1.2 million for a large box gym and on average £0.7 million for a SBF gym.

Pure Gym’s net cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 were £1.2 million, a decline of £25.8 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019. Operating cash flows of the group were significantly reduced by COVID-19. Membership subscriptions were frozen during the closure period, but this lost revenue was offset in part by government mitigation schemes combined with swift management action to reduce costs and preserve cash. Pure Gym’s net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £69.5 million, a decrease of £18.5 million, or 21.0%, compared to £88.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was principally as a result of increased interest payments. Pure Gym’s net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £88.0 million, an increase of £97.8 million compared to £(9.9) million in the year December 31, 2017. This increase was principally the result of payment of cumulative loan note interest and exceptional costs associated with the sale of Pure Gym to LGP in 2017 and the associated refinancing of Pure Gym. Working Capital Cash Flow for the six months ended June 30, 2020 of £16.1 million benefited from deferment of supplier payments at the period end, a measure taken in response to mitigate the cashflow impact of COVID-19. Working Capital Cash Flow for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was negative £6.0 million and this was primarily due to the unwind of year end accruals. Pure Gym benefited from Working Capital Cash Flow of £3.1 million, £13.5 million and £3.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Our Working Capital Cash Flow is generally positive, largely because membership fees are paid by members one month in advance, we benefit from favourable payment terms with our suppliers, and for years 2017 and 2018 on an IAS 17 basis, the cash property lease rental costs are lower than our property lease rental costs accrued in the income statement due to rent free periods on new gyms and the accounting requirement that future minimum or expected increases in rents are amortized equally over the life of each lease. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our total cash outflow on property lease rental was £40.5 million, or 15.9% of revenue. On a post-IFRS 16 basis, the presentation of this cash outflow on property leases is split across net cash generated from operating activities (being interest of £28.8 million) and net cash generated from financing activities (being capital of £11.7 million). 110 ----- _Net cash flows used in investing activities_ Net cash flows used in investing activities consist of expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and amounts paid for acquisitions, less proceeds from disposals and the portion of any capital expenditure funded through finance leases. Net cash outflow from investing activities was £254.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to £21.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and related to the acquisition of Fitness World, net of cash acquired. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £69.4 million, which was primarily the result of purchasing property, plant and equipment for 41 new sites. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £61.5 million, which was primarily a result of purchasing property, plant and equipment for 30 new organic sites along with acquiring Soho Gyms. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were £38.4 million, which was primarily a result of purchasing property, plant and equipment for 22 new gyms. _Net cash flows used in financing activities_ Pure Gym’s net cash flows from financing activities consists of the drawdown and repayment of bank loans, finance leases and shareholder debt. Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2020 was £288.8 million and consisted of £380.9 million of proceeds from the Bridge Facility obtained to acquire Fitness World, net of the repayment of £118 million debt acquired, in addition to the net drawings on the revolving credit facility of £37.0 million and finance lease capital payments of £13.2 million. Net cash generated from financing activities in prior periods primarily related to the issuances of Existing Notes. Net cash flows generated from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £28.2 million, which was a result of the issue of additional Existing Notes, net of the capital element of property leases on a post-IFRS 16 basis.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Pure Gym—Overview—Significant factors affecting our results of operations—Impact of COVID-19”. IFRS 16_ With respect to the 2019 Fitness World Financial Statements, Fitness World applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective method”. Therefore, cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard was recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 was to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or Fitness World EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. See Note 29 “Changes in accounting policies and disclosures” of the 2019 Fitness World Financial Statements. _Roll out of Fitness World clubs_ New gym openings have been a significant driver of our growth during the periods under review and our roll out strategy has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant effect on our results of operations.

This increase was principally a result of the impact of IFRS 16 implementation on January 1, 2019, which reduced other administrative expenses for the period by DKK 25.1 million, being a reduction in property lease costs that would otherwise have been charged under IAS 17 of DKK 357.4 million offset by an increased deprecation charge associated with right of use assets of DKK 332.3 million, the full period effect of operating the Basefit gyms following the acquisition from October 2018 and subsequent growth in these gyms as well as the full period effect of gyms opened in the prior period. _Special items_ Special items for the year ended December 31, 2019 were DKK 28.5 million, a decrease of DKK 7.8 million compared to DKK 36.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.

This was mainly due to the acquisition of Basefit.ch AG and other smaller acquisitions made in 2018.

Over this same period, the number of health and fitness clubs grew from 6,312 to 7,239, reflecting a CAGR of 3.5%, while the number of health and fitness club members grew from 8.8 million to 10.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 4.3% (Source: LDC Report). As of December 2019, 16% of the UK population was a member of a health and fitness club (Source: LDC Report). The 4.3% CAGR in health and fitness club members from December 2015 to December 2019 can be primarily attributed to the growth of value clubs and the increasing focus of UK consumers on health and wellbeing. This increasing focus on wellbeing is partially driven by consumers’ growing awareness of the significant benefits of a healthy lifestyle, as well as government initiatives such as “Change4Life”, a public health program that began in 2009 to tackle unhealthy lifestyles by encouraging exercise and healthy eating, and “This Girl Can”, an award-winning campaign launched in January 2015 to encourage more women in England to take part in sports and physical activity. Operators are also diversifying gym locations into less populated areas targeting smaller population catchment areas, supporting growth in penetration rates. Other factors have also contributed to the growth of the market over the past five years, including modest population growth, increases in consumers’ disposable incomes and innovation and new technology in fitness. The UK health and fitness club market is split into two main segments: public clubs and private clubs. The private clubs segment can be further split into: (i) premium clubs; (ii) mid-market clubs and (iii) value clubs.

Mid-market and premium clubs are generally larger in size and usually contain a wider range of facilities including, for example, wet areas (e.g. swimming pools, spas and saunas), racquet sports courts (e.g. tennis courts and squash courts), and social areas for members (e.g. bars and cafes), in addition to standard gym equipment and exercise classes. As of December 2019, there were 3,827 mid-market/Premium clubs in the UK with 4.2 million members, equivalent to an average of 1.1 members per club. Members are often required to sign up to fixedduration membership contracts, which typically include early termination fees. Mid-market and premium clubs generally have higher operating costs than value clubs due to their larger size, increased number of facilities offered, greater number of staff (e.g. in-gym sales and marketing teams and 129 ----- fully staffed reception and refreshment areas) and higher maintenance costs (e.g. cleaning and maintenance of wet areas). Value clubs (consisting of “low cost” clubs as defined by LDC) are private clubs that in general charge £25 or less per month across the majority of clubs in the chain. Value clubs offer a more focused product that is designed for consumers who only want to pay for and use fitness equipment (e.g. cardiovascular machines, fixed resistance machines, free-weights and fitness studios), rather than wet facilities such as swimming pools. Accordingly, only 5% of value clubs offer wet facilities as compared to 32% for UK private club operators (Source: LDC Report). Members of value clubs are generally not required to sign up to fixed-duration membership contracts and can in general cancel their memberships at any time without material financial consequence. Value clubs also generally have longer opening hours than traditional private clubs (e.g., the majority of Pure Gyms are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year (“24x7x365 access”)). The largest value club operators are Pure Gym and The Gym. (Source: LDC Report). The value club market has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. Since December 2015, the number of value clubs increased from 319 to 683 as of December 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 21.0%, while the number of value club members grew from 1.3 million to 2.8 million, reflecting a CAGR of 21.1% (Source: LDC _Report).

As a result of the strong growth in value club gyms and members, the revenues received in the value club market increased rapidly over December 2015 to December 2019 from £0.3 billion to £0.6 billion, a CAGR of 23.3% (Source: LDC Report).

However, value clubs have made a significant entrance into the market by taking market share from mid-market clubs and growing the overall number of private club members by attracting new consumers to the market that have not previously been members of health and fitness clubs. We believe that value clubs have been able to take market share because they offer a more affordable, flexible and “value for money” product than other private clubs. According to a consumer survey conducted by the CSR Report on our behalf in January 2016, 27%, 27% and 26% of consumers surveyed listed their primary reason for selecting a gym as proximity, price and value for money, respectively. We also believe that value clubs have been able to grow the overall number of private club members as value clubs address the most significant barriers to UK consumers taking on gym memberships (high membership fees and the desire not to enter into a fixed-duration membership contract) and appeal to a broad range of consumers. The recent shift in UK consumer trends towards “value for money” is also prevalent in other industries such as the supermarket industry where value operators such as Lidl and Aldi have taken market share from incumbent mid-market operators such as Wm Morrison and Tesco, and in the airline industry where value carriers, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, have taken market share from traditional premium airlines such as British Airways. An underlying element of this trend is the simplicity and consistency of a high-quality, yet affordable offering that aims to perfect the core product with “no frills”, akin to Premier Inn or Travelodge in the hospitality sector. Despite expansion of the value segment over the past years, there is significant opportunity for growth of value operators in the UK. There is an estimated potential for 1,200 – 1,400 low cost gyms in the UK (Source: _PwC UK Low Cost Gyms Report), supported by overall increase in gym memberships penetration rates and_ increasingly polarized landscape of lower and higher cost options.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Mid-market and premium clubs generally contain a wide range of facilities including, for example, wet areas (e.g. swimming pools, spas and saunas), racquet sports courts (e.g. tennis courts and squash courts), and social areas for members (e.g. bars and cafes), in addition to standard gym equipment and exercise classes. As of December 2019, there were 253 mid-market / premium clubs in Denmark with 194 thousand members, equivalent to an average of 770 members per club. Mid-market and premium clubs generally have higher operating costs than value clubs due to their larger size, increased number of facilities offered, greater number of staff (e.g. in-gym sales and marketing teams and fully staffed reception and refreshment areas) and higher maintenance costs (e.g. cleaning and maintenance of wet areas). Value clubs are private clubs that charge an average monthly membership fee of £19. Value clubs offer a more focused product that is designed for consumers who only want to pay for and use fitness equipment (e.g. cardiovascular machines, fixed resistance machines, free-weights and fitness studios), rather than wet facilities such as swimming pools. Members of value clubs are generally not required to sign up to fixed-duration membership contracts. Value clubs also generally have longer opening hours than traditional private clubs.

The information has been extracted from a variety of sources released by public and private organizations. The industry information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information published by such sources, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Throughout 2020, COVID-19 caused unprecedented disruption to our industry. Any forward-looking statements contained in the industry and market data presented below were made prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (except where stated otherwise) and have not been updated to account for the impact of such pandemic. There can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if the COVID-19 pandemic had been taken into account. See “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”._ Throughout the first ten months of 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, resulting in governments in affected areas taking unprecedented steps by enforcing lockdowns, in each case leading to business slowdowns and shutdowns. The spread of COVID-19 has had a material negative impact on the fitness industry, resulting in the temporary closure of a substantial number of gyms, which has led to an overall slowdown of the fitness market. Due to the closure of gyms, operators have increasingly frozen memberships in order to retain members, but have effectively ceased to generate revenue throughout the lockdown periods. As a consequence, gym operators have had to shift attention and resources from managing their business in an attractive environment to managing their cash burn rates in order to maintain sufficient liquidity during the lockdown period. Globally, various operators have not managed to retain sufficient capital and smaller, less profitable gym operators such as Xercise4Less and DW Fitness, in particular have experienced financial distress or filed for bankruptcy. In many regions, governments have offered support packages to support businesses and employees that are unable to operate due to COVID-19. Being among the most impacted industries, the fitness industry has benefitted from government support in many instances. These support measures include, but are not limited to, job-retention schemes, tax deferrals, business rates holidays and loan schemes. In addition, many operators have renegotiated their lease agreements, resulting in landlords allowing rent reductions and rent deferrals to share the burden of non-operating gym facilities. For more information about the risks associated with the impact of subsequent waves of COVID-19 and lockdowns on our ability to minimize cash burn via government aid, see “Risk Factors—The negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is significant and its effects will continue to _materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control”._ Following the initial easing of the initial lockdowns towards the end of the summer of 2020, our industry was focused on re-opening. The first weeks of re-opening displayed positive membership trends in many regions, with a study conducted in Norway providing evidence that going to the gym does not increase the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. In a swift response to the lockdowns, gym operators have quickly increased physical distancing between members by spacing equipment apart, in addition to introducing limits on the number of people using the facilities and enhanced cleaning protocols. At present, a ""second wave"" of the pandemic is currently underway across Europe, with many jurisdictions reimposing restrictions on movement, opening hours and required safety measures, all of which have impacted our industry. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, our industry is in the process of assessing the evolving COVID-19 situation, including an ongoing ""second wave"" across Europe, which remains dynamic and varied across and within the different countries in which we operate, including preparing for potential future local and national lockdowns. Regardless of the industry and governmental measures taken over the past months, the pandemic will have a lasting impact on industry dynamics post-lockdown. As a result of some operators struggling to re-open after business closures, there are expected to be opportunities for surviving operators to acquire the members that will be in search of a new gym as supply may be limited while the pandemic takes its toll on operators in the industry. A few of our competitors have already announced sale and closure, while others have been sold into administration shortly before or after reopening, and a few other competitors have either already faced liquidity issues or will possibly face liquidity issues in the near future due to lack of access to capital. 124 ----- The closure of other gym operators could lead to increased market share for the existing players. According to company information, these closures have already resulted in increased operational performance for Pure Gyms, as shown in the charts below: The charts above present a select number of Pure Gyms that we believe are currently drawing demand away from other, nearby gyms that have recently closed down or not reopened after the end of the first national lockdown period. Within the industry, there has been a rising trend of customers moving towards value operators and this trend is expected to accelerate in the near-term, as it did following the 2008 financial crisis, with consumer demand for the access to gyms, and particularly for access to Pure Gyms, likely to remain strong. According to a Sport England Survey of 311 respondents who were gym members as of May 4, 2020, 86% indicated that they would be likely to take out a gym membership. In the same survey of 1,575 respondents who were not gym members as of May 4, 2020, only 29% indicated that they would be likely to take out a gym membership, with the majority of cancellations in the non-gym member group being due to COVID-19 related reasons. The Sport England Survey also underscored the propensity of the younger demographic (ages 16-34) to want to start a gym membership following lockdown. Currently, 32% of total Pure Gym members are in the 16-24 age cohort and 36% are in the 25-34 age cohort, suggesting that our younger demographic is more likely to continue their gym membership across our estate. 125 ----- The recessionary environment that has resulted from months of lockdown is expected to further drive consumers to consider their gym budget and the value segment offers an attractive lower monthly cost. In addition, members are deemed less likely to be willing to engage in long-term contracts, as their spending budget generally remains uncertain throughout a crisis. The charts below demonstrate consumers’ willingness to continue spending on value gym offerings in a recessionary environment, as well as the leisure sub-sector’s overall growth during the prior economic downturn. Sources: Euromonitor, ONS, Mintel, LDC, OC&C analysis. 1. OC&C conducted a consumer survey in May 2017. The respondents were asked the following question: “Which of the following items would you be most likely to reduce spending on in the event of an economic downturn (Rank top 5)”. N = 1,779. Although a possible recession could change the dynamics in the fitness industry, the expectation is that members will continue to be willing to go the gym. Based on survey results, consumers were strongly considering going back to the gym at re-opening, which also reflects in the first months of data since re-opening. This is partly driven by the increased awareness of the importance of physical and mental well-being in a world shaken by a pandemic, which is strengthened by the extensive safety protocols operators have put in place. During lockdown there was, understandably, a rapid growth in consumers accessing online- and home-workout content. Although companies focused on these markets have benefitted from this trend, survey results show that users do not all view this as a replacement for the gym. Instead, alternative workout possibilities (online, at home, etc.) are expected to complement gym memberships, leading to a more integrated gym experience both offline and online. Gym operators also stand to benefit from online offerings as many have increased their online applications and virtual workouts. This could benefit gym operators by providing opportunities to further engage with their member base and help offset some of the costs of the lockdown. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Pure Gym and Fitness World were operating in an attractive and growing market, within which the growing value segment continues to have a favourable outlook. The European health and fitness club market had a market value of £24.0 billion as of December 2019 (Source: OC&C Report) and fitness club memberships continue to increase across most of the European geographies. The European health and fitness club market covers 33 countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and the UK. Over the four years from December 2015 to December 2019, members of the European fitness market increased from 54 million to 65 million, which reflects a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4.5% (Source: OC&C Report). In the UK, the health and fitness club market continues to benefit from the UK population becoming more health-conscious and from various government initiatives designed to promote healthy living and active lifestyles. Further stimulation of mental and physical well-being is expected in the aftermath of COVID-19. The 126 ----- UK health market has also benefitted from the increasing prevalence of value gyms, which have increased the availability of fitness facilities to a larger proportion of the population. The value gym market share increased from 7% to 13% over the past four years between December 2015 and December 2019, as a percentage of total market value (Source: LDC Report, OC&C Report). Historically, the UK health and fitness market has been served by mid-market and premium private gym operators and by public gym operators. While the value gym segment has grown quickly over the past several years, we believe there remains significant opportunity for further growth due to value gyms’ broad consumer appeal, even more so in a recessionary environment. Currently, 16% of the United Kingdom population is a member of a gym, which is below equivalent penetration rates in Sweden (22%), Norway (22%) and the U.S. (20%) (Source: OC&C Report). In Denmark 19% of the Danish population are gym members, and in Switzerland and Poland it is 14% and 8% respectively indicating that further growth is possible in all of our markets. In Denmark, market share of the value segment increased from 44% to 57% over the past four years between 2015 and 2019, as a percentage of total market value. The high market share of value gyms is mainly driven by the clear leadership position of Fitness World in Denmark. The value gym market has demonstrated resilience during periods of economic decline and can also support growth in these conditions as consumers consider cost-conscious alternatives. Consumer spending on gyms has shown resilience during periods of decreased overall economic activity, as demonstrated by a 2.1% CAGR in total gym spend in the UK health and fitness club market between 2006 and 2012, during which period total gym spend did not fall during any individual year. From 2008 to 2012, value gyms grew significantly, with membership increasing by a CAGR of 121% (Source: LDC Report, OC&C Report).",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

In addition, our scale enables us to pursue partnerships and other commercial arrangements that further differentiate our product offering and value proposition. _Property Acquisition—We have historically had a strong landlord covenant rating and have benefitted_ from “tenant of choice” status given our scale, strong brand and high quality product. As a result, we are generally able to secure our selected sites on attractive lease terms throughout the UK and Denmark. _Technology—We have invested heavily in building out our digital presence and software engineering_ teams and third-party technology relationships.

As a result, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the outperformance in the countries in which we operate, including for the following reasons: - _Increasing scale and a healthy degree of geographic diversification—Upon is acquisition of Fitness World, the newly Combined Group was number two in Europe by number of gyms with over 500 sites (517 sites as of November 9, 2020, consisting of 253 open sites, 236 closed sites in England, six closed sites in Denmark, three closed sites in Switzerland and 19 closed sites in Poland due to COVID-19 restrictions) and had a Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of £161.2 million as of December 31, 2019 (on a pro forma basis).

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated £255 million in UK revenue, £160 million in Danish revenue, £27 million in Swiss revenue and £5 million in Polish revenue. We have the largest gym estate and membership base in the UK market with 11% of total UK gym members and we are a leader in Danish fitness industry with an estimated 43% market share. We believe our expansive presence allows us to procure services and products on favourable terms due to the larger volume of our operations, which gives us superior purchasing power compared to smaller gym operators or new entrants into the market. - _High barriers to scale—We believe that new fitness brands would experience extreme difficulty in attempting to disrupt our strong presence and overall member loyalty, particularly in the UK and in Denmark. We are present in some of the most attractive locations, making it difficult for new entrants to open competing clubs given our accumulated expertise for identifying gym sites. We also have a diversified network of gyms which allows us to offer multi-site membership more effectively. Key features of our business that new entrants would have difficulty in scaling include: - _Expertise in property management—Given our established operating track record and position as the value gym industry leader in the UK and Denmark with national scale, we have acquired significant expertise in property acquisition and management. We are skilled at identifying site locations that will be successful and provide strong ROCE. In order to maintain our market-leading position, we have a strong site selection and property development team with industry expertise supported by an external team of professionals, such as lawyers, architects and planning consultants, as well as the technological tools at our disposal. In particular, we utilize a quantitative whitespace tool to identify attractive new locations in all geographies. The whitespace tool takes into account population statistics, drive time, local demographics, commercial space in catchment area, office locations data, competitor locations and infrastructure (for example, proximity to train stations) when analysing potential new sites. The whitespace tool both identifies attractive cities as well as optimal locations for rollout within a city. - _Industry leading technology platform—We continue to invest in our technology platform, consisting of both websites and mobile applications, where our members can book classes, pay for their memberships and other ancillary services. As the fitness industry increasingly converges with the digital sector, we believe that our technology platform allows our members to more easily access and purchase our services, which helps us attract and retain members. Additionally, our technology-enabled platform allows us to analyse user-specific data which in turn, supports our operational performance. This allows our management to better control all aspects of our pricing strategy, product development and promotional activities. Pure Gym and Fitness World have independently invested in their technological platforms and the Combined 142 ----- Group will benefit from the combination of IT capabilities across its operations as these systems converge. - _Leading marketing expertise driving strong brand awareness—We have an increasingly sophisticated, multi-channel digital-led marketing strategy which is not overly reliant on any single channel. We employ a range of marketing techniques through various media channels in order to promote a contemporary and differentiated brand, which would be difficult for new entrants to replicate given our resources and prior marketing experience. - _Superior convenience as a result of network scale—We have the largest gym network in the UK and Denmark, which allows us to capitalize on potential members’ desire for proximity. We believe this to be a competitive advantage, given that research indicates that proximity is among the top two most important factors for members when choosing a gym. - _Greater access to capital allowing for rapid growth—Based on our strong operating cash flow conversion, which is driven by our highly efficient and high-margin operating model, comparatively low maintenance capital expenditure requirements and positive working capital inflows, we are able to continue investing in new and existing sites. This allows us to protect and grow our market share, while we observe that some mid-market gym operators are often choosing not to reinvest in their existing sites or in expansion. - _Pricing sophistication—We have the ability to employ dynamic pricing at certain gyms in order to tailor our price points to the local market. This allows us to adapt to local markets by managing member enrolment and thus optimize revenues. - _Purchasing Scale—We believe we are the largest purchaser of gym equipment in our key geographies from leading suppliers including Matrix, Precor and Technogym, thereby reducing the costs of constructing and operating our gyms. - _Highly experienced team with significant industry know-how—Our team has exceptional local knowledge, which is based on strong relationships that they have developed over time.

Our gyms are clean, well-maintained and are fitted out with high-quality changing rooms and shower facilities and audio/visual systems. We have welcoming environments and we seek to support all members in the pursuit of their fitness goals, regardless of their current abilities, as demonstrated by our “everybody welcome” philosophy in Pure Gyms and “create healthy habits for all” philosophy in Fitness World clubs. _Affordable pricing—Our flexible and low-cost membership structure provides excellent value for money_ for our members, with student discounts and day passes at Pure Gym locations and off-peak membership options.

Accordingly, members have the freedom and the flexibility to leave at their convenience without incurring cancellation fees and have the ability to freeze their memberships for months at a time. - _Access—We generally offer 24x7x365 access in the UK and extended opening hours in Denmark. This contrasts with the opening hours of mid-market and premium operators, which tend to be more restricted. Clubs in Switzerland are open for 14 to 17 hours a day during weekdays with more limited weekend hours depending on each club. - _Free classes—We have dedicated group exercise studios, including purpose-built stationary cycling studios in many locations. Most Pure Gym clubs offer over 50 free classes per week taught by professional personal trainers. Fitness World incorporates a wide range of class offerings in their membership model. Other operators in the value market do not typically offer such an extensive range of classes. - _Premium Memberships—For an additional monthly premium, our members can choose to upgrade their enrolment options, which provides them with a number of additional benefits. For example, they may have the ability to book classes earlier than standard members, guest passes and larger discounts on sports and fitness brands or receive a set number of personal training sessions a year. - _Online Membership Management—Our online website and app platforms allow members to manage their membership online, freeze or cancel their membership, book classes, locate gym facilities, track fitness data and engage in fitness challenges.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The operating model allows us to offer a compelling customer proposition, support high levels of membership and require low levels of operating and Initial Capital Investment costs. Collectively, these factors drive strong unit economics and ROCEs. The key characteristics of the model are as follows: _Highly capital efficient—Greenfield gyms require a known level of maintenance and refurbishment_ capital expenditure post initial pre-opening investments relating to leasehold costs and fit-out. Landlords will often contribute to the initial fit-out of clubs and in Denmark, these landlord contributions are often significant. Gyms generate stable and predictable EBITDA at maturity (2436 months post opening), driving attractive ROCE. _Low personnel costs—We are able to operate our gyms with low levels of employed personnel primarily_ through the use of technology. For example, Pure Gym uses an online joining process and Fitness World offers in-app enrolment, both of which eliminate the need for a dedicated in-gym sales forces which are commonly used by mid-market and premium operators. Members at Pure Gym and Fitness World locations also use fully-automated PIN-controlled entry portals or member cards to facilitate secure access to gyms, which eliminates the need for additional staff. We believe that we can build upon existing commonalities between Pure Gym and Fitness World and further increase personnel cost efficiency by applying some UK best practices to Fitness World gyms through measures such as unmanned hours covered by video surveillance with tailored alert systems. _Highly effective utilization of space—Unlike most mid-market and premium operators, we do not install_ pools, spas, saunas, steam room, extensive cafes or other high-end amenities in our gyms. These amenities are generally expensive to construct, operate and maintain and take up a significant amount of leased space. We believe that these amenities are generally less utilized by members and that by eliminating them we are able to install a greater number of pieces of high utilization fitness equipment, such as treadmills, free weights and stationary bikes. As a result, our gyms in the UK, 144 ----- Denmark and Switzerland can support high levels of membership while operating on low operating and Initial Capital Investment costs. In addition to consistent and predictable growth, we have strong overall gym performance in the countries in which we operate. For our UK operations, revenue increased from £159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 16.8%. Similarly, Pure Gym Run-Rate Adjusted increased from £69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 14.5%. For the acquired Fitness World, revenue increased from £121.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 16.6%. Fitness World Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA increased from £28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to £51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a CAGR of 22.3%. The Combined Group benefits from a highly cash generative business model, which is driven by manageable maintenance capital expenditure requirements and positive working capital inflows. The working capital dynamics are underpinned by rent free periods for new leases, favourable terms with our primary gym equipment providers, and payments from members being received in advance, while major suppliers are paid in arrears. Following the historical period of investment, there is limited further expenditure required in central functions (for example, a head office), which helps to ensure that we are a fully scalable platform going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Key Strengths,212.2.6,Highly experienced executive leadership team,"Our senior management has an established track record of delivering growth and operational excellence in their current roles at the company and in their prior roles at a range of other businesses. Senior management is supported by an experienced management team in key areas, including property acquisition, property development, operations, IT, marketing, human resources and finance. The experienced management team from Fitness World has proven capabilities to drive growth across multiple geographies. The individuals that form part of our property acquisition and development teams are highly experienced in the markets in which we operate. They have strong relationships with landlords, agents, developers and contractors and a proven ability to identify and develop a large number of successful sites while promoting consistent growth as evidenced by our estate growth. We believe that the strength and experience of the property acquisition and development teams ensures that we are well placed to secure attractive new gym sites. Under the current CEO, Pure Gym has grown from an operator of 84 gyms with £37 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to an operator of over 500 gyms with £161.2 million of Combined Group Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 (on a pro forma basis). In addition to a strong track record of operational excellence and property acquisition expertise, our leadership team also adheres to a balanced fiscal policy of deleveraging. Pure Gym has consistently reduced its leverage over the past three years. In November 2017, Pure Gym had a leverage ratio of 4.6x (calculated as senior secured net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA). As of December 2018, this reduced to 3.9x and as of December 2019, the leverage ratio was further reduced to 3.6x, demonstrating a consistent organic deleveraging profile. Further, we have a clear deleveraging strategy for the future as we intend to: - deploy new equity capital in a considered and measured way to open new sites, improve existing sites and deliver technology assets; - reduce leverage by growing EBITDA through new site openings and deployment of technology assets in our core business and through capital-light franchising growth; and - balance capital deployment with cashflow generation and progressive deleveraging. Pure Gym has made substantial investments in management over the past two years and important business functions are now generally managed internally, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. For example, important IT functions were brought in-house in 2015 and the IT team was strengthened with a number of new hires. The senior management team is comprised of high calibre individuals with broad experience from various sectors and previous businesses. This ensures that our senior management and other important management teams are well invested and are capable of executing both our focus on performance delivery and our growth strategy. We have a strong and differentiated culture centred on collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship and we believe that this culture has been a key driver of our ability to deliver strong historical growth and widen the gap between us and other operators in the value gym market. 145 ----- This culture has also helped us to attract and retain high quality personnel and create a highly motivated work force that is dedicated to delivering the best product possible. Pure Gym is recognized as an “employer of choice” after being placed in the Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2018 (the results of which are based on employee feedback).",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

211,Offerings 2020.md,212,BUSINESS,212.3,Strategy,212.3.1,A rigorous focus on operational excellence to drive the growth and profitability of our existing estate,"We remain focused on maintaining the high-quality performance of all our gyms and delivering profitable growth across our existing estate. Management drives revenue performance in a number of ways, including: _Maintaining high standards through targeted investments—We are focused on carefully investing in our_ existing estate in order to maintain the high-quality of our gyms and we seek to continuously optimize the product offer and member experience. This in turn supports our ability to drive membership volumes and tenures, word of mouth recommendations and provide value for money for our members. _Driving Average Revenue Per Member (“ARPM”)—We take a multi-layered approach to increasing_ ARPM by: - _Developing new commercial products—We have implemented and continue to develop new membership options to attract certain types of new members to our gyms and increase our fee yields while consistently offering excellent value for money. For example, Pure Gym has continued to see an increase in penetration of its premium membership products across its gyms. These products take advantage of our technology platform to offer members the option to prebook classes on a priority basis, take a friend to the gym, obtain multi-site access and freeze their memberships. Similarly, Fitness World offers premium membership options for members who are interested in sports nutritional products or a set number of personal training sessions per year. - _Increasing ancillary sales per visit—Ancillary sales are an integral part of the initiative to increase ARPM. For example, Fitness World has successfully grown ancillary sales through its personal training programs and through developing its own successful brand of nutritional supplements by: - educating over 300 new personal trainers and over 400 new instructors through their Fitness Institute and Fitness World Academy; and - offering nutritional products ranging from sports and energy drinks, protein bars and protein powder for purchase through its on-site vending machines, at reception, or through membership options, such as Fitness World’s “All In” membership in its Denmark clubs, which entitles members to one nutritional product per day. - _Bringing the UK’s variable pricing expertise to Fitness World markets—Fitness World does not currently offer dynamic pricing in the same way that Pure Gym can in the UK. It is believed that there are potential upsides to bringing Pure Gym’s pricing expertise for setting membership fees specific to local markets Denmark and Switzerland. Our operational experts tailor pricing to specific local markets and monitor and change the specific prices over time as the market and our competition evolve. In turn, this allows us to monitor member enrolment, manage capacity and maximize revenue and returns. - _Optimizing site capacity—We seek to optimize the capacity of our existing gyms where this is possible and viable. Capacity optimization can involve the physical extension of gyms, or the 146 ----- redesign of certain aspects of gyms to eliminate site-specific utilization bottlenecks, such as the substitution of low utilization equipment, or the installation of additional automated entry portals or access gates to increase capacity. - _Marketing and CRM—We have strengthened our marketing approaches and we are taking a more sophisticated and data-driven approach to membership acquisition and retention. Pure Gym’s brand awareness is strong but has further room for significant growth in the context of our large estate of gyms. We utilize channels, such as television advertising and social media, to increase brand awareness and drive membership growth. Fitness World’s brand awareness is high in Denmark and we are continuing to build on this awareness by marketing services and products through the Fitness World designated app, social media, and through our association with brand ambassadors. - _Development of new sales channels and cross marketing—We are leveraging our nationwide scale in the UK and in Denmark to identify opportunities to partner and enter into commercial arrangements with large corporations that have the potential to deliver incremental membership volumes. - _Leveraging our technology infrastructure—We have made significant investments in our IT team and infrastructure and believe this helps us provide a value-added member experience and the opportunity for additional member sales. _Maintaining a rigorous focus on cost containment—Our ability to offer low membership fees and_ generate strong unit economics and ROCEs is underpinned by our low-cost operating model. As a result, we are focused on optimizing and controlling gym-level operating costs, as well as Initial Capital Investment Costs. These costs are controlled centrally and we intend to continue to leverage our growing scale in order to achieve more favourable purchasing terms with third-party suppliers, service providers and contractors. In addition, we are pursuing a number of ongoing operational efficiency projects, such as energy saving initiatives, to minimize future gym-level cost increases and improve returns. Following several years of investment into central functions such as IT, marketing and finance, we believe that our central functions are well invested and that we will not require significant incremental central cost expansion in the medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

We continue to focus on driving the operational and financial performance of New Gyms as they mature, with key areas of focus including: - Using our experience to select attractive gym locations where the demand and demographics result in predictable financial performance - Consistency of delivery and high standards - Leveraging our experience to adapt to local markets - Optimization of volume and ARPM in each gym - Driving scale benefits - Successfully increasing margins and member enrolment for newly-acquired businesses We plan to leverage our experience to continue the organic roll out of new gyms with strong ROCE. Future growth in the value segment will be driven by the development of new value gyms, continued market share gains from mid-market and premium operators, as well as public gyms operated by local authorities, and overall growth in gym participation rates due in part to the increasing awareness and availability of value gyms in each of our markets. The significant opportunity for further growth in the value gym market is evidenced by: - The significant success of the value gym concept to date and its broad consumer appeal. 147 ----- - The current overall penetration rates of gym membership in existing markets as of December 2019; only 16% of the British population, 19% of Danish population, 14% of the Swiss population, and 8% of the Polish population have gym memberships (Source: OC&C Report). We believe that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this substantial market penetration opportunity as market leaders in the United Kingdom and Denmark with a long, successful track record of opening new gyms and rapidly growing membership, revenue and profitability. The Combined Group has a structured and disciplined approach to site identification, acquisition and development. Our property acquisition teams are highly experienced and have a strong network of property agents, landlords and developers that provide us with a substantial number of new site opportunities. Our gyms have been proven to work across the United Kingdom and Denmark in a wide variety of property types and, accordingly, management considers a broad number of locations for new gyms. We have also proven our ability to innovate through initially testing and now proving the SBF concept in the UK, which features gyms that are 6,000 to 9,000 square feet in size and enable us to adapt the Pure Gym model to smaller local markets. The UK and Denmark have similar levels of ROCE though different cost structures. Gyms in Denmark generate lower margins and require lower initial capital expenditure compared to UK gyms, due to sizeable landlord contributions and that are partly offset by higher rents. Landlords in Denmark frequently pay for a substantial part of the initial club fit-out costs, thus reducing the payback periods and increasing ROCE.

In November 2009, the first two Pure Gyms were opened in Manchester and Leeds, with a third gym opened in Edinburgh in December 2009. Pure Gym built upon the success of its first three gyms and opened six new gyms in 2010. Since 2010, Pure Gym has increased the pace of roll out of new gyms. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Pure Gym opened 41 gyms. (See “Business—Estate Overview—Pure Gym”). In January 2015, Humphrey Cobbold, formerly the CEO of Wiggle, an online cycling goods retailer, joined Pure Gym as its Chief Executive Officer. In June 2015, Sir Chris Hoy, an eleven-time world champion and six-time Olympic champion track cyclist, invested in Pure Gym and was appointed as a special advisor and brand ambassador.

Subsequent to the acquisition, Pure Gym divested or closed 12 LA Fitness gyms while retaining 31 LA Fitness gyms and, in September 2017, Pure Gym completed the conversion of all 31 of the LA Fitness gyms to the Pure Gym format. In 2018, Pure Gym acquired Ovalhouse Limited (trading as Soho Gyms) consisting of ten fitness clubs based in prime locations throughout London. Four of the ten gyms were converted into the Pure Gym model in 2018, five Soho Gyms were converted in the first half of 2019 and the remaining site is pending conversion in 2020 subject to re-evaluation of the gym site for acoustics and leasing terms. In September 2018, Alex Wood joined Pure Gym as the new Chief Financial Officer (See “Management—Directors—Alex Wood, Chief Financial Officer”).

As a result, in addition to the common features described above, certain gyms may have specific features, such as “ladies only” areas. Pure Gym’s gyms do not have cafes, saunas, steam rooms, spas or pools, which are typically used by a small percentage of gym members. These amenities result in higher operating and Initial Capital Investment costs, and lower the amount of high utilization gym floor space, which limits the number of members gyms can support. Pure Gym has successfully proven a new gym format, which it refers to as “small box format” or “SBF” gyms. These gyms are very similar to other Pure Gyms but are smaller in size, typically in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 square feet. The SBF gyms enable Pure Gym to grow into areas that would not otherwise support a larger 153 ----- sized gym. As of December 31, 2019, Pure Gym’s estate consisted of 15 SBF gyms, 14 of which were organic and one which was acquired. _Fitness World_ Fitness World gyms vary in size between approximately 8,000 square feet and 45,000 square feet (gross), with an average size of approximately 13,500 square feet (gross) as of December 31, 2019. Fitness World gyms generally have very similar characteristics to Pure Gyms with the following differences to highlight: - digital membership platform and dedicated apps to compete in fitness challenges, receive ondemand training programs, book personal training sessions and track fitness metrics; - products from its sports nutrition brand, Functional Nutrition, including ready-to-drink and powder supplementation products for sale in vending machines across its clubs; - receptionists present during the hours of operation at most fitness club locations; - in-house personal trainers and an accompanying Fitness Institute that trains over 400 personal trainers a year; - enhanced “digital cycling” programs; and - low-cost fitness clubs called “Urban Gyms” which remove staffed reception desks, shower facilities, and group classes that are unutilized by cost-conscious members. Going forward, the Fitness World model and the fundamental characteristics of Fitness World clubs will remain in place as the Combined Group will continue to invest in the existing estate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

This base level is then increased as membership begins to increase and actual usage patterns are observed and analysed. This is part of Pure Gym’s capital efficient fit-out strategy and ensures that it is able to tailor its product offering at the local level. Pure Gym is focused on maintaining the high quality of its gym equipment in order to provide its members with a compelling in-gym experience. As such, Pure Gym has a comprehensive fitness equipment and maintenance program with Matrix and Precor, who are contracted to repair any non-functioning piece of equipment within 48 hours. Pure Gym has a six to eight-year replacement cycle for cardio equipment over which time the equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis.

The additional fee for each personal training session on top of the membership fee clients pay for gym access is agreed with and paid directly to the personal trainer. There are typically between 10 and 15 personal trainers at each gym, depending on the number of members. All personal trainers at Pure Gym locations currently operate as independent contractors and are classified as rent-paying personal trainers (“Rent PTs”) or PT/FCs. Rent PTs are self-employed personal trainers who pay rent to use Pure Gym premises to train their clients. Rent is set contractually for each gym using the market rate for each locality and is paid on the 1[st] of each month. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our _business—Pure Gym may be adversely affected by a change in the historical employment status of personal trainers operating at its gyms”._ After extensive trials, Pure Gym recently rolled out a new operating model across all sites in which Pure Gym employs Fitness Coaches (“FCs”) for 12 hours per week under the terms of a standard employment contract. FCs may spend these 12 hours leading induction sessions for new members at Pure Gym, taking exercise classes, undertaking light cleaning, answering any questions members may have and generally having a visible presence on the gym floor. Separately, FCs will typically enter into a license agreement to be a rent-paying personal trainer. Where an individual performs both roles, they are referred to as “PT/FCs”. The PT/FC model replaces the historic Hours PT model, offers FCs clearer career development opportunity within Pure Gym and gives them certain benefits of being employed such as annual leave allowance, free gym membership and access to free employee assistance. At the same time, it provides Pure Gym with more control over its day-to-day operations during the 12 hours it employs FCs. This, in turn enables gym managers to operate their gyms more effectively. Based on the information currently available as well as high level business forecasts, Pure Gym does not expect the impact of the change in operating model set out above to cause a material adverse change to its Adjusted EBITDA. Pure Gym aims to attract fitness professionals who are passionate about fitness and who specialize in specific areas such as sports therapy, injury rehabilitation, nutrition and strength and conditioning. _Fitness World_ Personal training is offered in 184 out of 241 Fitness World clubs and continues to be a popular service among members.

In addition to this “Core” membership, Pure Gym offers a number of additional options. There are discounted “Off Peak” memberships available in many gyms, where access is restricted to quieter times so pricing is lower. In addition, members can choose to pay a higher fee and select premium membership options such as “Multi” and “Plus” which provide additional benefits such as being able to access more than one gym, bringing a guest along to work out with, priority class bookings, or entitlement to additional services such as Yanga sports water and/or massage beds in some gyms. These options provide members with a range of flexibility to tailor their membership to best suit their personal needs. This also assists Pure Gym in optimizing revenue 159 ----- across gyms to leverage its nationwide footprint and optimizes value added sales since each premium products earns Pure Gym an extra £5-7 per month. As of December 31, 2019, 74% of members held “Core” memberships, 3% held “Off Peak” memberships and 23% held premium options. In addition to memberships, Pure Gym sells shorter term “day passes” which can be bought (at a slightly higher price) to access facilities for specific one, three, seven, or 30 days at a time. This is a useful “trial” option for prospects or people who travel repeatedly. These “pay as you go” options are not deemed memberships, so they do not form part of the membership count. _Fitness World_ Fitness World offers the widest range of flexible membership options in its home market of Denmark.

On the other end of the spectrum, the Fitness Premium membership includes access to any Fitness World club, five personal training sessions per year, one sports nutrition product at the facility per day, and an option to freeze membership once per year. Fitness World tailors the membership options it offers in each region. For example, in highly concentrated gyms in Copenhagen, Fitness World does not offer the more basic gym-access only memberships. Basefit offers three membership options in its facilities in Switzerland. The first option is for base membership through a monthly or annual contract. The second option if members choose to commit to a 12-month binding period is to purchase an annual membership for off-peak gym access or an annual membership for regular hours access.

A structured and disciplined approach has been crucial for successful site acquisition and has helped Pure Gym build a strong nationwide site portfolio. Pure Gym has a four-stage new site acquisition process which includes: (1) Initial Site Targeting; (2) Preliminary Screening of Opportunities; (3) Detailed Evaluation and Assessment of Priorities; and (4) Formal Feasibility Reports and Investment Decision Making (as described below). Pure Gym leases all of its gym sites. (a) The Property Acquisition Team Pure Gym has a dedicated six-person property acquisition team, headed by the property acquisition director, who is responsible for the acquisition of new gym sites. The team reports to the UK Finance Director, who provides oversight, strategic direction and leadership. The responsibilities of the property acquisition team include identifying potential site locations, evaluating their suitability as Pure Gyms, developing financial 162 ----- forecasts for prospective sites in conjunction with the operations, finance and development teams and negotiating lease terms with landlords. The individuals who form part of Pure Gym’s property acquisition team are highly experienced in the UK property market and have strong relationships with landlords, developers, agents and other gym operators who may be looking to divest sites. The property acquisition team uses extensive data and proprietary tools to identify and evaluate new gym sites. (b) Initial Site Targeting Pure Gym uses a number of approaches to ensure it is identifying a large number and broad cross section of potential new locations for its gyms across the UK: (i) First, Pure Gym has categorized the UK into different catchment areas from major conurbations to cities and towns to ensure it has a “top down” list of priority site locations from across the country. (ii) Second, Pure Gym has worked with external consultants to build a proprietary postcode driven assessment model to help it identify potentially attractive locations using demographic, socio-economic, and other data. The model forecasts estimated financial returns expected from gyms opened in those locations. The model is tested against proprietary data from Pure Gym’s portfolio of existing sites, which is the largest network of gyms in the UK This “bottom up” approach generates a prioritized list of over 200 locations which are a key focus area for the property acquisition team. (iii) Third, Pure Gym’s property acquisition team continually reviews sources such as planning registers as well as maintaining close contact with landlords, property agents and developers. (iv) Fourth, Pure Gym is active in seeking out and pursuing opportunities to take over leases from existing gym operators. Since inception, Pure Gym has taken on 34 leases of sites at which a gym was previously operated by another operator (excluding an incremental 41 M&A Conversions). (v) Lastly, Pure Gym consistently updates its processes and databases and analyses the performance of its existing gyms in order to identify similar locations that build on previous successes. (c) Preliminary Screening of Opportunities Given the number of locations and opportunities that it identifies, the Pure Gym business has developed a disciplined and efficient approach to screening opportunities. There are six key evaluation parameters to this screening process: - site characteristics; - headline population and demographic characteristics; - likely lease terms; - location characteristics; - local competitive dynamics; and - other important local considerations. The preliminary screening process uses data, analysis, internal tools and the judgment of the property acquisition team to decide whether or not to proceed with a given site opportunity. The key output of the preliminary screening stage is a decision to complete a formal site assessment. (d) Detailed Evaluation and Assessment of Priorities 163 ----- At this stage of the process, Pure Gym invests more time, effort and money to reach a decision on whether to prepare a formal feasibility report and ask the Capex Committee, which includes the CEO and CFO, for formal approval for the site. The key steps at this stage are: - two members of property acquisition team visit the site; - development team, architectural design team and a nominated contractor visit the site; - discussions and negotiations with the landlord, planners and potentially other leaseholders; - detailed analysis and consolidation of feedback from the operations and development teams; - creation of financial forecast and returns model; and - analysis of potential impact on existing sites, if relevant. (e) Formal Feasibility Report and Investment Decision Making If a site is deemed to be attractive following the detailed evaluation, a formal feasibility report is prepared. The work and documentation for these reports is standardized and they are prepared by the property acquisition team. If the Capex Committee approves a formal feasibility report, the lease for the site will be entered into, unless the circumstances change in the intervening period. Pure Gym believes that it has developed a rigorous, transparent and professional approach to identifying new sites and to guiding decision making over capital investment. Pure Gym also believes that the discipline of its property acquisition process, combined with the institutional knowledge gained from opening more gyms than any other private, low-cost gym operator in the UK since 2009 is a major contributor to its significant growth, competitive advantage and success. Pure Gym believes the power of its property acquisition team and process is evidenced by the fact that it has never closed an organic Pure Gym site and its Mature Gyms delivered an Average Gym ROCE of 43% in 2019. (f) Site Development Once a lease for a new site has been entered into, the development team takes responsibility for managing the construction of the gym. Pure Gym has robust processes, a proprietary data set of benchmark costs, and very strong contractor and supplier relationships to assist in the development of sites. These factors continue to be a major contributor to Pure Gym’s strong growth, competitive advantage and success. The development team consists of 31 people as at December 31, 2019, including the property development director and four project departmental leaders. The development team is responsible for managing the development of new sites and the refurbishment of existing sites. The development team uses third party contractors to execute actual site works. Each new gym fit out is put out to tender with at least two contractors. Pure Gym has longstanding relationships with its contractors as well as with other key third-party business partners such as architects, acoustic engineers and other building services providers. Pure Gym’s strong relationships and continuity with these partners has enabled it to cost effectively develop and open a large number of new gyms each year, while simultaneously delivering a consistent, high level of quality. Construction and development of each new gym generally takes 8 to 10 weeks and the costs and timings of developing an Organic Conversion gym is generally the same as for an Organic Greenfield gym. Pure Gym follows the traditional method of development in the UK health and fitness industry, by which the landlord is generally responsible for the shell of the unit, while the operator is responsible for the design and fit-out of the unit. (g) Gym opening targets and pipeline The Combined Group has had a strong pipeline of new organic gyms: we have opened 19 new locations in 2020 (12 in the UK, five in Denmark and two in Poland) with no further openings planned for this year. We are targeting to open approximately 25 to 40 organic gyms across the Combined Group in 2021, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. 164 ----- Pure Gym believes that it has a substantial advantage over competitors for acquiring leased space given its strong brand, leading market position, historically strong landlord covenant, excellent reputation and proven ability to drive foot traffic to landlords’ properties. Pure Gym believes that there is a market opportunity for around 1,200 to 1,400 value gyms and approximately 4.5 million to 5.0 million value gym members in the UK market. (h) Property leases Pure Gym seeks to enter economically feasible leases with sufficient terms to justify the development costs of gyms. In addition, Pure Gym also seeks to ensure that its leases protect it from substantial increases in rents due to potential future volatility in the commercial property market and provide it with sufficient flexibility to exit unprofitable locations. Pure Gym’s organic site lease agreements typically include the following key terms, which provide it with substantial visibility over its future property costs: - monthly or quarterly rents paid in advance based on a fee per square foot of leased space; - monthly or quarterly service charges, where relevant, paid in advance; - typically up to 12 months rent-free period at the start of the lease; - landlord contributions to fund a certain amount of fit-outs costs; - 15-year terms; - no landlord breaks; - tenant-only break rights at year 10; - rent reviews every five years, based largely on RPI with caps of approximately 3–4% per annum and collars of approximately 0–2% per annum in London and open market rent reviews typically outside of London; and - security of tenure at the expiration of the lease, whereby we have the right to apply for a new tenancy at the end of the term, and the landlord may only oppose the grant of a new tenancy on very limited grounds. While Pure Gym is generally able to standardize these terms for most of its gyms, many of the leases that were acquired from LA Fitness have different terms than described above. These alternate terms include longer lease terms, fixed rent uplifts not tied to RPI, open market rent reviews and no tenant break rights. Despite these differences, Pure Gym believes the leases acquired from LA Fitness are attractive. The following table sets forth the remaining lease lengths for Pure Gym’s estate of gyms. As reflected in the table below, 61% of Pure Gym leases have at least ten years remaining on their terms.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The main differences are that the Fitness World estate is more mature in Denmark and consequently, the Danish acquisitions team is smaller than that of Pure Gym. The Combined Group will benefit from best practices application of site selection tools and analysis of new sites will be subject to the Combined Group’s Capex Committee approval process. 165 ----- (a) The Property Acquisition Team Fitness World has an experienced property team that is responsible for identifying potential targets and consistently tracking local competitors. The property team leverages its experience from Fitness World’s 241 club estate, its credibility with landlords and its strong relationships with local real-estate agents in order to leverage scale and negotiate the best possible rental deals. The property team uses multiple site identification methods to identify potential targets and establishes potential hurdles for each location with a focus on membership potential at each site. The team is also responsible for detailed property development specifications and ensuring consistent execution across the gym estate. Fitness World leases all of its gym sites. (b) Initial Site Targeting Fitness World Denmark has a dedicated two-person property acquisition team which is responsible for the acquisition of new gym sites. The responsibilities of the property acquisition team include identifying potential site locations, evaluating their suitability as Fitness World clubs, developing financial forecasts for prospective sites in conjunction with the operations, finance and development teams and negotiating lease terms with landlords. The individuals who form part of Fitness World’s property acquisition team are highly experienced in the Danish property market and have strong relationships with landlords, developers, agents and other gym operators who may be looking to divest sites. The property acquisition team uses a white space tool developed together with PwC to identify and evaluate new gym sites. In Switzerland, Fitness World has a similar site-targeting process but with only one employee in each country responsible for the acquisition of new gym sites. (c) Preliminary Screening of Opportunities When potential locations and opportunities are identified, Fitness World Retail Development screens the sites using different parameters such as proper retail and fitness space, fit into expansion strategy and eco-system, demographics and member potential, proper lease terms, and competitive strength in the area. The preliminary screening process uses data, analysis, internal tools and the judgment of the Fitness World Retail Development team to decide whether to proceed with a given site opportunity. The key output of the preliminary screening stage is a decision to complete a formal site assessment. (d) Detailed Evaluation and Assessment of Priorities If the site makes it through the preliminary screening phase, a more detailed evaluation of the site will take place. This evaluation includes, but is not always limited to: - A site visit with at least two people from the site evaluation team (Fitness World Retail Development and Fitness World Facility Management); - A meeting with the landlord and/or real estate agent to discuss initial commercial terms and plans for the location to see whether the site will satisfy Fitness World standards for reasonable member price points and competitive leasing terms; and - Taking photographs inside of the site including digital drawings. - Drawing the future Fitness World club images; - Negotiating commercial and rental agreements with the landlord and/or real estate agent and reaching an agreement; and - Developing a feasibility study or business case on the project with projected member potential, revenue, EBITDA, club contribution margin and the cannibalization effect from clubs in the potential eco-system based on the analysis from the white space tools and other resources. (e) Formal Report and Investment Decision Making If a site is deemed to be an attractive option following the detailed evaluation, a formal feasibility report is prepared and presented to the Capex Committee of the Combined Group, which includes the CEO and CFO. If 166 ----- the Capex Committee approves the site, Fitness World will enter into the lease for the site, unless there are changed circumstances in the intervening period. Fitness World believes that it has developed a rigorous, transparent and professional approach to identifying new sites and to guiding decision making over capital investment. Fitness World also believes that the discipline of its property acquisition process, combined with the industry knowledge gained from opening more gyms than any other gym operator in Denmark since 2005, is a major contributor to its significant growth, competitive advantage and success. (f) Site Development Once a lease for a new site has been entered into, the Fitness World Retail Development Team takes responsibility for managing the construction of the gym in cooperation with the Fitness World Retail Operations Team, which starts preparing for future staffing needs. Fitness World has robust processes, a proprietary data set of benchmark costs and has recently entered into strong contractor and supplier relationships to assist in the development of sites. These factors will continue to be a major contributor to Fitness World’s strong growth, competitive advantage and success. Fitness World uses third party contractors to execute actual site works. In rare cases, the landlord can build the club if it fits into a bigger project, but Fitness World prefers to carry out the site development itself. Fitness world has strong relationships with its contractors and third party business partners such as acoustic engineers and other building service providers. Construction and development of each new gym approximately takes three months. If another fitness club is acquired, the process takes a shorter amount of time, but can often be more complicated due to the members already in the club, their habits and preferences. Fitness World follows the traditional method of development in the Danish health and fitness industry by which the landlord is generally responsible for the shell of the club, while the operator is responsible for the design and fit-out of the club. (g) Property leases Fitness World seeks to enter into economically feasible leases with sufficient terms to justify the development costs of gyms. In addition, Fitness World also seeks to ensure that its leases protect it from substantial increases in rents due to potential future volatility in the commercial property market and provide it with sufficient flexibility to exit unprofitable locations.

Considerable focus and attention is placed on local advertising campaigns for gyms that are in the pre-opening phase or have recently opened. Approximately £50,000 is budgeted for each new gym opening to support all advertising in order to build high local awareness ahead of the open date.

He has since agreed to extend his association with Pure Gym for a further three years. Dina Asher-Smith joined as a brand ambassador in April 2019 on an initial three-year contract. Dina is a sprinter and the UK’s fastest ever woman, currently holding World Championship Gold and Silver medals. She is one of the UK’s leading sports celebrities with a strong reputation and a growing national presence in media, which will further increase her exposure and may support Pure Gym’s brand presence by association. Sir Chris Hoy will also play an active part in the Olympics, further increasing his exposure. Pure Gym monitors the visibility and preference of its brand on a quarterly basis. In November 2019, national brand awareness stood at 44%, over twice the level of the closest value-gym competitor and second in the whole of the gym sector.

Google analytics premium, channel attribution modelling, sales modelling and other techniques are used to ensure that Fitness World can track and measure CPA and marketing return on investment as accurately as possible. Based on Google analytics and search engine optimization reports, approximately 50% of customer acquisitions were online and 50% in club conversion. Fitness World has developed a mobile app as a platform for all members, which offers free training programs, an option to follow member training from any location in or outside of the fitness club with “healthkit” integration, free Bodytracker to track fitness metrics with data through a personal app and monthly challenges. The mobile app usage is an effective marketing tool and has resulted in increased retention of existing members.

The eXerp system interfaces with the Gantner gym access system, which controls gym access for members 169 ----- via PIN, RFID wristband and key fob. These systems allow Pure Gyms to operate without a staffed reception. Pure Gym’s online joining process also allows it to operate without an expensive in-gym sales force. Technology is also used to reduce fit out and maintenance costs. For example, equipment heat maps are developed in partnership with suppliers and used to configure newly opened gyms to reduce wear and tear on equipment and provide equipment utilization reports. Pure Gym has also developed and uses a proprietary capacity management tool, which allows it to track and monitor the capacity of gyms and identify bottlenecks at different stages of the member journey.

By virtue of their low cost, no contract and flexible model, Pure Gym and Fitness World believe that they have opened up the opportunity for physical activity to many hundreds of thousands of people who would otherwise have been excluded from such activity. The Combined Group has encouraged widespread localized activities by its individual gyms and regions as well as empowering management teams in gyms to do what they feel makes a difference in their local communities. For example, over the last year, Pure Gym has supported local charity runs in Scotland, helped hospitals in Manchester, and supported collections for homeless people in the West Midlands while also working with charitable and other organizations such as the Macmillan Cancer Relief and Action Medical Research. More recently, Pure Gym raised over £350,000 for Mental Health UK by completing a seven day relay linking all Pure Gyms across the country. Fitness World also runs charity events throughout the year. The most notable of these events is the Team Rynkeby “Bike for the kids” initiative in which 70 Fitness World clubs coordinate nationwide cycling events. The proceeds from tickets to the cycling events are then donated to Child Cancer Foundation Denmark. Fitness World most recently donated DKK 0.6 million in 2019. In terms of governance and participation in the business, the Combined Group works to high standards. The management board of Pure Gym in the UK is chaired by the Chief Executive and three out of seven members including the MD of the UK business are women, which management believes is appropriate given that over 40% of Pure Gym’s members are women. An open and constructive culture is nurtured carefully and there are multiple routes for staff across the whole business to communicate and raise issues with members of the senior management team. There is a whistle-blowing policy in place in addition to a fully-equipped HR team that actively ensures there are alternative routes beyond line management through which staff can raise concerns. The Combined Group is focused on ways to reduce energy consumption in its gyms and has placed emphasis on designing its gyms with a number of energy saving and “green” features. The following is a selection of features that have been incorporated throughout the estate, where practically possible: - mechanical and electrical systems that comply with government energy-saving schemes, including HMRC’s Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme for energy-saving technologies; - LED energy-saving lighting and water-saving bathroom and shower facilities; - energy-efficient fitness equipment, including treadmills, exercise bikes and other self-powered cardio equipment that have display screens powered by batteries and user-generated electricity; and - recycling the building materials from the fit out of its gyms. Over the last 12 months, the Combined Group has commenced a more structured program to systematically analyse all areas of energy usage and environmental impact and to develop strategies to reduce these significantly over the coming years.

Pure Gym and Fitness World believe that this ensures consistent application of their health and safety policies across their estate. Pure gyms incorporate a number of features to ensure the health and safety of its members, staff, associates and business partners.

In addition, each of the Pure Gyms have continuously recording closed-circuit television security cameras, which are proactively monitored during non-peak hours, for the monitoring and reporting of accidents and other emergencies. Furthermore, Pure Gyms have help points where members can speak live to the individuals who are monitoring the CCTV feeds and automated defibrillators are installed in all gyms. Pure Gym employees undergo a continuous and extensive training program in health and safety policies, which is conducted through e-learning modules. In the year ended December 31, 2019, of the approximately 70 million visits to a Pure Gym, only 0.01% resulted in health and safety incidents.

The Issuer is a holding company whose only significant assets will be the Capital Stock of its Subsidiaries and receivables under intra-group financing arrangements.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be declared entirely void or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

Within 217 ----- 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder with the following information: (1) a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control” and all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed; (3) any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have the Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer and (b) at the Issuer’s option, the Notes so accepted for cancellation. Change of control events with respect to the Issuer will constitute a mandatory prepayment event under the Revolving Credit Facility and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer constitute a default thereunder. If we experience a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment event or default under our agreements, we could seek a waiver of such mandatory prepayment event or default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. However, in the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance such Indebtedness, amounts outstanding under such Indebtedness could be declared due and payable. The Revolving Credit Facility contains, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources, and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may 218 ----- _not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events and change of control events.”_ Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if, pro _forma for such transaction, the Issuer’s Total Net Leverage Ratio remains below a certain threshold._ A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon notice given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). A Change of Control Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified (at any time, including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Revolving Credit Facility contains, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer (or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries) becomes a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this Description of the Notes as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period.

During the Suspension Period, the Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged and the obligation to grant further Guarantees will be suspended. Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of _Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date_ on which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”)._ 223 ----- There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.K. pound sterling-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock, the U.K. pound sterling-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock denominated in a foreign currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.K. pound sterling equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided_ if such Indebtedness is incurred or Disqualified Stock is issued, to refinance other Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, as applicable, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.K. pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.K. pound sterling-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock does not exceed (1) the principal amount of such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, as applicable, being refinanced _plus_ (2) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting discounts, defeasance costs, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, as applicable, being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date will be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Issuer dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such 235 ----- Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured, (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it is issued or guaranteed by other obligors or secured by other collateral or (3) secured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other secured Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority lien with respect to the same collateral. If any Indebtedness is refinanced in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a percentage of RunRate Adjusted EBITDA, and such refinancing would cause the percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated based on the Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA will not be deemed to be exceeded to the extent the principal amount of such obligations secured by such newly incurred Indebtedness does not exceed the sum of (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus (ii) the related costs incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

If since the beginning of such Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Test Period will have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such Test Period as if such Specified Transaction had occurred at the beginning of the most recently ended Test Period. For purposes of this definition in the Indenture, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any Specified Transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations will be made in good faith by a Financial Officer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run-rate” cost savings, synergies and operating expense reductions resulting from or related to any such Specified Transaction (including the Transactions) which is being given pro forma effect that have been realized or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies are taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of any such Specified Transaction (in each case as though such cost savings, synergies and operating expense reductions had been realized on the first day of the applicable period and as if such cost savings, synergies and operating expense reductions were realized for the entirety of such period).

For the purpose of determining Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma effect shall be given on the same basis as for calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation will be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Financial Officer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in 269 ----- accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, will be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. For purposes of this definition in the Indenture, any amount in a currency other than U.K. pound sterling will be converted to U.K. pound sterling based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the most recent twelve month period immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner consistent with that used in calculating Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable Test Period. “Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of, without duplication: (1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period; (2) all cash dividends or other cash distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Preferred Stock during such period; and (3) all cash dividends or other cash distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any series of Disqualified Stock during such period. “GAAP” means International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time. Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. 293 ----- To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; _provided_ that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 295 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The comments do not deal with other United Kingdom tax aspects of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. It applies only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. The following is a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It is not intended as tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser. Holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult with their professional advisers. Holders of Notes who may be liable to taxation in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes are particularly advised to consult their professional adviser as to whether they are so liable (and if so under the laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only to certain United Kingdom taxation aspects of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, holders of Notes should be aware that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The International Stock Exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” for these purposes. Securities such as the Notes will be treated as listed on The International Stock Exchange if they are included in the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on The International Stock Exchange. In other cases, absent any other relief or exemption, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an applicable double taxation treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a holder of Notes, HMRC can issue a direction to the Issuer to pay interest to the holder of Notes without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double taxation treaty). The references to “interest” in this description of United Kingdom taxation mean “interest” as understood in United Kingdom tax law. The statements do not take any account of any different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation. In particular, where Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount, then any such element of premium may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Interest on the Notes should constitute United Kingdom source income for United Kingdom tax purposes. Accordingly, and subject to certain exceptions applying to various categories of investors (including, in particular, exceptions applying to persons not resident in the United Kingdom), holders of Notes may be subject to United Kingdom tax by way of assessment (including self-assessment) on such payments of interest even when paid without withholding for United Kingdom tax. Holders of Notes may wish to note that, in certain circumstances, HMRC have powers to obtain certain information relating to the Notes, including in relation to interest and other payments derived from the Notes.

The summary is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; 297 ----- - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers or traders in securities; - S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; - tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation or an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level.

Qualified stated interest generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate. The stated interest on the Notes will qualify as “qualified stated interest”. A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of qualified stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the pound sterling interest payment (determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of such qualified stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the pounds sterling received.

The U.S. dollar 298 ----- value of such pound sterling denominated accrued qualified stated interest will generally be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within the applicable taxable year.

If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued qualified stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt of the qualified stated interest.

As a result, U.S. Holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity”, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the OID includible in income for each prior accrual period, and reduced by any cash payments received on the Note (other than qualified stated interest). The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “Tax Considerations—Payments of qualified stated interest”. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax_ basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note, increased by any OID previously included in income by such U.S. Holder with respect to such Note, and reduced by any cash payments received on the Note (other than qualified stated interest). The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized will be translated into U.S. dollars based on the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes this election, the election must be applied consistently by such holder from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that has not made the settlement date election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (as ordinary income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate on the date of settlement) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized (based on the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition). A U.S. Holder will also recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal of a Note (taxable as ordinary income or loss) upon the sale or other taxable disposition of the Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price of the Note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note.

Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year.

The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss financial institutions are disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or by means of group requests within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will not be transferred automatically in the absence of consent, and instead will be exchanged only within the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the double taxation agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland. In this regard, on July 17, 2019, the U.S. Senate approved the 2009 protocol (the “Protocol”) amending the double taxation agreement regarding income tax between Switzerland and the U.S. (the “amended DTA”). The Protocol had been approved by the Swiss Federal Assembly on June 18, 2010. On September 20, 2019, Switzerland and the U.S. exchanged the instruments of ratification of the Protocol. With the exchange of the ratification instruments, the amended DTA formally entered into force. The Protocol introduces a mechanism for the exchange of information upon request in tax matters between Switzerland and the United States, which is in line with international standards, and allows the United States to make group requests under FATCA concerning non-consenting U.S. accounts and non-consenting nonparticipating foreign financial institutions. On October 8, 2014, the Swiss Federal Council approved a mandate for negotiations with the U.S. on changing the current direct-notification-based regime to a regime where the relevant information is sent to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which in turn provides the information to the U.S. tax authorities. _Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters_ Switzerland has concluded a multilateral agreement with the European Union on the international automatic exchange of information (the “AEOI”) in tax matters. The agreement became effective as of January 1, 2017, and applies to all 27 EU member states and also Gibraltar. On November 19, 2014, Switzerland signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (the “MCAA”). The MCAA is based on article 6 of the OECD/Council of Europe administrative assistance convention and is intended to ensure the uniform implementation of Automatic Exchange of Information (the “AEOI”). The Federal Act on the International Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (the “AEOI Act”) entered into force on January 1, 2017. The AEOI Act is the legal basis for the implementation of the AEOI standard in Switzerland. The AEOI is being introduced in Switzerland through bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements. The agreements have, and will be, concluded on the basis of guaranteed reciprocity, compliance with the principle 302 ----- of speciality (i.e. the information exchanged may only be used to assess and levy taxes (and for criminal tax proceedings)) and adequate data protection.

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests”, defined as the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. A company’s centre of main interests may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the centre of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the centre of main interests being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other EU member state. If the centre of main interests of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the centre of main interests of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency Regulation. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s centre 304 ----- of main interests is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the EU member state where the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the EU member state within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a EU member state that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. In order to avoid the opening of secondary proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the EU member state in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that EU member state. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in an EU member state other than the EU member state in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary proceedings are opened. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan, however, is voluntary. Brexit, i.e. the UK ceasing to be a member state of the European Union on January 31, 2020, will not have an immediate impact on cross-border corporate restructuring and insolvency as EU regulations will continue to apply until the end of the transition period, which, unless extended, will run until December 31, 2020. The position beyond December 31, 2020 is unknown at this time as it depends on a trade deal being agreed between the UK and the EU, and whether or not such a deal includes a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of a deal addressing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the “centre of main interest” rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating security is not a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Party for unsecured creditors (please see “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations— England and Wales—Prescribed Part” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation_ to floating charge security. Please note, however, that, with prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English insolvency law, there is a possibility that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document governed by English law take effect as floating 306 ----- charges because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant charging company to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of an English Company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge”.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (provided the floating charge has become enforceable), and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company went into an immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations—England and Wales—Priority of claims” below._ An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. During an administration there is a statutory moratorium and, in general, no legal proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. A court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory purposes of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). If an English Company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it would not be able to be enforced while it is in administration without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator (although a demand for payment could be made under a Guarantee granted by it). There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, a secured creditor will not be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver. If the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed and any ordinary receiver already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company out of court, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Company must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of the Insolvency Act and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative 307 ----- receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. A floating charge qualifies if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English Company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure), and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations—England and Wales—Fixed versus floating charges” above)._",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

There are two forms of winding-up: (a)_ compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the latter two proceedings is the solvency of the company in question: in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the 308 ----- company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. In the case of compulsory winding-up, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected). Unlike compulsory liquidation, when a creditors’ voluntary liquidation commences there is no automatic moratorium on proceedings against the company. The liquidator, any creditor or contributory may, however, apply to the court for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company; to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up; to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): First ranking_ claims: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness; _Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the_ order of priority in which expenses are paid); _Third ranking claims: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include_ (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit. The Finance Act 2020 additionally provides that, with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1, 2020, claims by HMRC dating from the 12 months before the onset of the relevant company’s insolvency in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee national insurance contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer national insurance contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers will also constitute secondary preferential debts. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all preferential debts within each category rank equally; _Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._ However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (please see 309 ----- “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency _Law Considerations—England and Wales—Prescribed part”); Fifth ranking claims:_ - first, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - second, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - third, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. _Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_ funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the English company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court will generally not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he was a creditor of the English company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into.

The requirement for an English company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or becoming insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, irrespective of whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

An English Company may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s “centre of main interests” is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable.

The CIG Act affects the foregoing analysis and that analysis should be read bearing in mind the factors outlined below. The explanatory notes to the CIG Act (during its passage as a bill through Parliament) stated that its purpose is, among other things, “to introduce greater flexibility into the insolvency regime, allowing companies breathing space to explore options for rescue whilst supplies are protected, so they can have the maximum chance of survival”. 314 ----- The CIG Act contains three key measures to achieve that purpose that may be of particular relevance to the holders of the Notes. First, the CIG Act provides for a new, free-standing moratorium for UK companies, which is intended to allow a company in financial distress a breathing space in which to explore its rescue and restructuring options free from creditor action. The moratorium is overseen by an insolvency practitioner acting as a monitor although the directors remain in charge of running the business on a day-to-day basis. Certain types of financial services companies are ineligible for the moratorium, including parties to capital market arrangements. Secondly, the CIG Act provides for a new restructuring plan procedure which is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of arrangement (approval by creditors and sanction by the court), but which will additionally include the ability for a company to bind classes of creditors (and, if appropriate, members) to a restructuring plan, where not all classes have voted in favour of it (known as cross-class cram down). The compromise or arrangement proposed under the plan must be sanctioned by the court and will be subject to meeting certain conditions. As is the case with a scheme of arrangement, the court will always have absolute discretion over whether to refuse to sanction a restructuring plan. For example, even if the conditions of crossclass cram down are met, the court may refuse to sanction a restructuring plan on the basis it is not just and equitable. The Secretary of State may by regulations exclude “authorised persons” or company of a “specified” description as defined in section 31 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (which may include creditors of the Issuer and/or one or more of the Guarantors). Thirdly, the CIG Act provides for temporary restrictions on certain types of enforcement action in respect of unpaid debts. Specifically, the CIG Act: (i) prevents any statutory demands made against companies in the period between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 from being used as the basis of a winding-up petition at any point on or after April 27, 2020; and (ii) provides that a creditor cannot present a winding-up petition between April 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 based on the company's inability to pay its debts as they fall due unless that creditor has reasonable grounds for believing that (a) COVID-19 has not had a financial effect on the company or (b) the company would be unable to pay its debts even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to each English Company would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law (unless that company’s centre of main interests for the purposes of the Insolvency Regulation is held to be in an EU member state in which case the laws of that jurisdiction will, subject to certain exceptions, govern the relevant insolvency proceedings). The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Similarly, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in Great Britain, provide that a foreign (i.e. non-English) court may have jurisdiction where an English 305 ----- Company has its centre of main interests, or where it has an “establishment”, in such foreign jurisdiction. In case of any conflict, the Insolvency Regulation will prevail over the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including (without limitation) by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company’s members resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (see below). Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the English Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the English Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the English Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court (or an appeal court, as the case may be) to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a statement of the debtor’s liquidity status, documenting the debtor’s inability to pay its obligations as they fall due, and that the insolvency is not of a purely temporary nature. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security, see below. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor’s claim against the debtor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been duly performed (hence, is considered invalid in case of a bankruptcy), the creditor does not have adequate security. 315 ----- The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates its business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (a debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy. A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if (i) the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security in assets belonging to the debtor, (ii) the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security in assets of a third party (provided the terms of such third party security restrict the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings) and/or (iii) the creditor’s claim is not due and a third party offers to provide adequate and valid security, in each case as further set out in Section 20 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act. In this context, adequate security means security which provides full coverage for the creditor’s claim against the debtor. Third party security also includes any guarantee whereby the guarantor assumes primary liability (selvskyldnerkaution). If the security would be avoidable in bankruptcy or if the applicable act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor would not have adequate security for these purposes. In order to petition for bankruptcy, the creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. This does not mean that the creditor is required to have a basis of execution for its claim (e.g., a judgment in a civil case, a settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage) or that the creditor’s claim must be due and payable in all circumstances. However, not all claims that have not yet become due and payable may form the basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that the creditor will not recover any part of its claim in case the debtor were to be declared bankrupt. However, if there is reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor has entered into transaction(s) that may be avoided in a bankruptcy, the creditor may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have any substantial assets. In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the potentially avoidable transactions with some degree of certainty. If a creditor has filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor and the conditions for declaring the debtor bankrupt are not satisfied, the creditor may be liable to pay damages if the debtor has suffered a loss and/or to pay compensation for damage to the debtor’s reputation. In connection with a bankruptcy petition, the petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the bankruptcy estate. In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount up to DKK 40,000, unless the creditor accepts otherwise. If the debtor has filed the petition for bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the available and unencumbered funds of the bankruptcy estate or a willing third party. If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced against a Danish Guarantor, payments by that Danish Guarantor under its Guarantee may be delayed and may not be made in full. If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced against a Danish Guarantor, the holders of Notes, after adjudication of the claim by the Trustee/courts, will receive payments from that Danish Guarantor under its Guarantee (to the extent not covered by valid security) as a calculated dividend i.e. of the proceeds of any free and unencumbered (after payments of certain expenses and senior/preferential claims, see below) assets which have been liquidated as part of the bankruptcy proceedings based on the outstanding amount guaranteed. Often, the dividend will be disbursed as a lump sum at the time of the conclusions of the bankruptcy estate. Provisions on avoidance and set-off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the Guarantees. Enforcement of security interests provided by the debtor in the debtor’s assets is restricted under Danish bankruptcy laws. Those security interests (except for those qualified as “håndpant eller anden tilsvarende _sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy Act) may only be enforced by the bankruptcy trustee (kurator)._ However, mortgagees and execution creditors may demand enforcement of such security interests six months after the declaration of bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The creditor’s meeting is scheduled to a 316 ----- date after the bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated and the proceedings haven been opened. The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is normally the case. The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules set out in the Danish Bankruptcy Act. The trustee must not be a related party of the debtor or otherwise dependent on the debtor and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. As a further general rule, the bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee.

Reconstruction proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor company or a creditor. The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the company operates its business. Reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor company is “insolvent” as defined in the Danish Bankruptcy Act. For these purposes, the definition of “insolvent” is the same as for bankruptcy proceedings - see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark —Bankruptcy Proceedings” above._ If the insolvency criterion is satisfied, the bankruptcy court will appoint a reconstructor and a restructuring accountant to administrate the debtor company. The incumbent management will continue to operate the company, but any material transactions may not be carried out without the prior approval of the reconstructor. Payment of creditors may only be done in accordance with the statutory priority of claims. See “Limitations on _Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark—Priority of Claims” below. However, the court may decide that the reconstructor_ takes over the management as such. The reconstruction of a company must aim to achieve the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of the business of the company by transferring the business; or (3) a combination of a compulsory composition and a transfer of business (or part thereof). The reconstructor must try to achieve these objectives in no particular order. If the reconstructor does not realize any of these objectives - in a way that enables the company to fulfil its duties (likely after a compulsory composition) as they fall due - the company will automatically enter into bankruptcy proceedings, unless it turns out that the company is not (or is no longer) insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The decision to liquidate a company is made by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting that also appoints a liquidator. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved. Liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding under Danish law and only companies that are solvent can be liquidated.

Transactions favouring particular creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors pursuant to the statutory priority of claims may include, among other things, payment by unusual means of payment, payments made in advance of the due date of the debt or payments that have critically deteriorated the debtor’s ability to pay, in each case provided that the relevant payment did not appear to be ordinary, or the provision of security for debts already incurred (known as “old debt”). Below is a summary of (i) the avoidance rule relating to security for old debt (other than security by way of a registered floating charge (virksomhedspant or fordringspant), in respect of which special rules apply) and (ii) the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions. Other avoidance rules are not summarized herein. Pursuant to Section 70 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, any security interest which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, or which is not duly perfected without undue delay after the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, can be avoided if the relevant act of perfection is completed later than the date falling three months prior to the “deadline date” (fristdagen). The deadline date is further defined in Section 1 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act. In practice, the deadline date will often be the date on which the bankruptcy court received a petition for reconstruction proceedings or bankruptcy. The hardening period of three months is extended to two years if the security is provided in favour of a related party of the debtor unless it is proven that the debtor neither was, nor upon creation of the security became, insolvent. Pursuant to Section 74 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act (known as the “general clause” (generalklausulen), any disposition which unduly favours a creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the debtor’s property is prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the debtor’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the debtor was, or by the disposition became, insolvent, and the favoured party knew or ought to have known about the debtor’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the disposition “improper” (utilbørlig). For these purposes, transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behaviour will generally be deemed improper. Improper behaviour may be any such behaviour which is contrary to the purpose of insolvency proceedings, for example, where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to satisfaction of their claims. This general avoidance rule is not subject to any fixed hardening period, meaning that a transaction may be vulnerable to be set aside even if it was completed long before the deadline date, provided that the aforementioned conditions are otherwise satisfied.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The trustee registers all claims and examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive a dividend. The ranking of creditors is set out in Section 93 - 98 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act which indicates the order in which claims against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate are settled (excluding claims that are fully covered by valid security). All higher ranking claims must be satisfied in full before any claims in the next level will be entitled to a dividend. The priority of claims is as follows: - _First, claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings and claims according to affirmed agreements; - _Second, claims in connection with any preceding restructuring or liquidation proceedings and related matters; - _Third, “privilege claims”, mainly employee salary claims, including salary income taxes (relating to salary claims being filed) but excluding salary claims from the management board (direktører), who are not salaried employees (funktionærer); - _Fourth, claims of suppliers for duty on products that are delivered to the debtor and duty paid for the purpose of resale within a period of twelve months prior to the date of the bankruptcy petition 318 ----- being filed (but only (i) as regards certain specifically listed duties, and (ii) to the extent of the supplier’s claim for reimbursement of the duties are prepaid); - _Fifth, other unsecured claims (e.g., all other claims except for deferred claims); and - _Sixth, deferred claims (e.g., claims relating to interest accrued after the cut-off date (usually the bankruptcy date), certain parts of instalments under certain lease agreements, claims of compensation that do not reflect actual losses to the beneficiary, fines, promises of gifts and subordinate loan capital, and related matters).

Pursuant to Section 206(1) of the Danish Companies Act, a Danish limited liability company may not, directly or indirectly, provide any loan, guarantee, security or other financial assistance in relation to the financing and/or refinancing of a third party’s acquisition of shares in the company or its direct or indirect parent companies (the “prohibition against financial assistance”). The prohibition against financial assistance also applies to subsidiaries of the Danish company whether or not incorporated in Denmark. However, pursuant to Section 206(2) of the Danish Companies Act, the prohibition against financial assistance does not apply if the financial assistance (i) is granted on the basis of a credit rating of the persons receiving financial assistance, (ii) has been approved by the company’s general meeting, such approval to be based on a written report submitted by the company’s central management body specifying certain matters relating to the financial assistance in question, (iii) does not exceed what is advisable, having regard to the company’s financial position, (iv) does not exceed the company’s distributable reserves and (v) is provided on arm’s length terms. In addition, pursuant to Section 210(1) of the Danish Companies Act, a Danish limited liability company may not, directly or indirectly, provide any loan, guarantee, security or other financial assistance in favour of, among others, its shareholders (the “prohibition against upstream shareholder loans”). The prohibition against upstream shareholder loans does, however, not apply in case of loans, etc. to direct and indirect parent companies which are limited liability companies incorporated in any member state of the European Union or the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United States. Further, pursuant to Section 210(2) of the Danish Companies Act, the prohibition against upstream shareholder loans does not apply if the financial assistance (i) does not exceed the company’s distributable reserves, (ii) is provided on arm’s length terms, (iii) has been approved by the company’s general meeting or by the company’s central management body on the basis of an authorization granted by the general meeting, (iv) does not exceed the amount proposed or accepted by the company’s central management body and (v) occurs after presentation of the company’s first annual report. _Corporate Benefit_ In order for a Danish company to provide a guarantee or security in relation to another group company’s debt, it is a general requirement under Danish law that the Danish company obtains an adequate corporate benefit from such guarantee or security. This is related to the general duty of the board of directors and the management board of a Danish company to act responsibly (forsvarligt) and to ensure a proper management of the company’s assets. Further, the board of directors and the management board must always act in the best interests of the Danish company’s individual interest. When assessing whether it is in the Danish company’s best interest to guarantee or secure another group company’s debt, the board of directors and the management board should consider all relevant circumstances, including (i) the company’s financial position, capital and liquidity resources, (ii) the benefits that the company will obtain from providing the guarantee or security, (iii) the potential risks related to providing the guarantee or security, including an assessment of the credit rating of the principal debtor, and (iv) securing that the arrangement is on arms’ length terms. 319 ----- If sufficient corporate benefit is not obtained, among others, the guarantee or security may be null and void. It is not clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit can be established when a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company. _Guarantee Limitations_ To comply with the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions, any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries will be deemed not to be so granted and limited if and to the extent required to comply with the provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation, as set out in Sections 206-212 of the Danish Companies Act. In addition, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors will be subject to a fixed cap as determined by the board of directors of the relevant Danish Guarantor. Any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor will be subject to a fixed cap of DKK 150 million (£18.4 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1316 to £1.000 as of September 18, 2020) with respect to Fitness World Group A/S and a fixed cap of DKK 185 million (£22.8 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1316 to £1.000 as of September 18, 2020) with respect to Fitness World A/S (together, the ""Danish **Guarantee Caps""). The Danish Guarantee Caps will apply on an aggregate basis with respect to any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor in respect of the Notes, the Existing Notes and the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Danish Guarantor, your claims may be severely limited or even reduced to zero. The above-mentioned limitations will apply to the guarantees and security interests granted by the Danish Guarantors as well as obligations of the Danish Guarantors or other Danish companies under the Intercreditor Agreement, including, without limitation, obligations and liabilities under or pursuant to any provisions relating to subordination, turnover, rights of recourse, mandatory prepayments, other application of proceeds and/or release of liabilities on distressed disposals. Furthermore, certain obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (such as, for example, obligations in respect of subordination and turnover of claims) will constitute a security interest under Danish law and may not be valid and/or enforceable to the extent such security interest has not been duly perfected. Consequently, and pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the obligations of each Danish Guarantor with respect to any guarantee, security and other obligations in relation to the Notes and the Note Documents will be subject to limitation language, which may severely limit the value of any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance granted by such Danish Guarantor. See _“Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Financial assistance, _corporate benefit and other limitations on the Danish Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Danish Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Danish Collateral”. Dividend Restrictions in Connection with Government Aid Received in Connection with COVID-19_ In addition, there are further limitations on the ability of the Danish Guarantors and other direct and indirect Danish subsidiaries of the Issuer to make dividends to assist in servicing the Notes and other debt as a result of government aid received in connection with COVID-19. Fitness World A/S has received DKK 110 million (£13.4 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1792 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) in compensation for fixed costs under the Danish fixed cost compensation scheme enacted in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Pursuant to Danish Executive Order No. 574 of 5 May 2020 regarding compensation for fixed costs to businesses in financial crisis due to COVID-19, as amended, it is a condition to the receipt of compensation for fixed costs in excess of DKK 60 million (£7.3 million, as converted to pounds sterling at the average rate of DKK 8.1792 to £1.000 as of June 30, 2020) that the recipient company does not complete a capital reduction for financial years 2020 and 2021, including by way of payment of dividends and/or buy-back of the company's own shares. Accordingly, Fitness World A/S is prohibited from paying out any dividends for financial years 2020 and 2021, unless Fitness World A/S repays the fixed cost compensation received in excess of DKK 60 million.

The agreed enforcement procedures are not binding on third parties such as creditors that have registered an attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets. Such third-party attachments and rights can only be cleared through a court administered public auction. In the absence of specifically agreed enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public auction in accordance with the Danish Administration of Justice Act (Consolidated Act No. 938 of 10 September 2019 as amended, retsplejeloven). Pledges of shares and accounts as well as security assignments of receivables may be enforced without an execution order.

Absent perfection or registration of the Security Agent with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), the holder of the security interest may not be able to enforce its rights in the Danish Collateral against third parties, including a bankruptcy administrator and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same assets.

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of the relevant company having granted the Danish Collateral; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security Agent have and will maintain the capacity to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of bankruptcy of the relevant company having granted the Danish Collateral; (iii) whether the security and guarantees can be validly granted in favour of the Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether the holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently.

In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA, _Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favourable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of a bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of a Swiss debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf _Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed on a private liquidation. However, if bankruptcy is declared_ while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted. _Summary of Current Insolvency Regulations in Effect in Switzerland_ The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._ Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency laws in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent 323 ----- there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the overindebtedness (Art. 725 Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and over indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in over indebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for bankruptcy without delay and non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both damage claims and (in extraordinary cases) sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out of court) workout within a relatively short period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of time is supposed to be. However, many legal scholars consider such period to be four to six weeks. Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over indebted. If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection. For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage). The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office delivers continuation threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) to the debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of the threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court. The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings (summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Furthermore, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings. Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In 324 ----- such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honoured if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the Swiss government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische _Stundung) for a maximum period of up to four months or not. With its decision the court appoints a commissioner_ provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case circumstances would justify it, the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) may withhold a public announcement of the granting of the provisional moratorium, provided third party interests are well protected. In such case, (i) the creditors and other authorities will not be notified, (ii) debt collection proceedings may still be initiated or further pursued (unless challenged by the debtor) and (iii) a provisional commissioner (provisorischer Sachwalter) must be appointed in all circumstances. In case it is obvious that there are no chances for a successful reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag), the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht), acting on its own motion, opens insolvency proceedings over the debtor. In case the moratorium has been granted provisionally (provisorische _Stundung) and in case during the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a_ composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely (definitive Stundung) and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition agreements: The ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag), the composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and the composition agreement in insolvency proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). During a definitive moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due 325 ----- upon adjudication). However, a debtor may, subject to consent by the commissioner (Sachwalter), terminate longterm agreements (Dauerschuldverhältnisse) (other than employment agreements) without notice (even if notice periods apply under the agreement as such), provided (i) the continuation of the long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) would impede or at least seriously challenge the intended financial recovery and (ii) provided the counterparty to such long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) is held harmless (it being understood that the respective claim would be a claim in the composition proceeding (Nachlassforderung)). Interest payments will be stopped for unsecured claims during the moratorium (unless otherwise explicitly provided in the composition agreement). The moratorium aims at facilitating a rehabilitation of the debtor under protection of the court or the conclusion of one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Privileged claims must be paid in full.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of art. 111 Swiss Code of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA), in which case the right of objection pursuant to art. 41 DEBA (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible. In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA). After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party to the security documents relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from “accessory” security interests and have a secured claim, the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to _the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Security over the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted by local laws”._",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

In particular, a transaction (which term includes 326 ----- the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) that is detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: - The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for already existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any way other than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is excluded if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the intention to disadvantage its creditors, or discriminate some creditors against others or to favour some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence must have been known, to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable. If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and/or any security interest and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained by the holders of the Notes under a guarantee and/or security interest that have been avoided would have to be repaid by the holders of the Notes. The Swiss principles on avoidance may, therefore, limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover payments due on the guarantee and/or any security interest. 327 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Therefore, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will contain certain limitation language in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations of the Swiss Guarantor, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantor to grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of the Issuers without the risk of violating such restrictions under Swiss law and to protect management from personal liability; such “limitation language” is standard market practice for, amongst others, indentures, guarantees and security documents in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or any security granted by the Swiss Guarantor apply in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations must be within the corporate purposes and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and must not result in a repayment of the share capital, legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or other non-permitted distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will limit the value of any 322 ----- Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations assumed by the Swiss Guarantor to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that the Swiss Guarantor is permitted to distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at such time. Presently, the freely distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves available for distribution (minus, without double counting, any freely disposable equity that has to be blocked for any loans granted by the Swiss Guarantor to a direct or indirect parent company of the Swiss Guarantor or a direct or indirect subsidiary of any parent company pursuant to applicable Swiss corporate law and applicable accounting standards) at the time or times at which payment in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations is requested. In addition, the enforcement of the Swiss Guarantor’s Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to Swiss withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double taxation treaties) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations are regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained above under “The Offering—Additional _Amounts” or in the Indenture or any other documentation related to the Notes. In addition, any obligation to_ gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations granted by the Swiss Guarantor would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor.

Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager agrees that it shall act in accordance with Regulation (EU) 596/2014 on market abuse (market abuse regulation) (and implementing and delegated regulations thereunder) as regards exemptions for buy-back programs and stabilization of financial instruments. The Stabilizing Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the Stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a Stabilizing transaction or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will undertake any such stabilization action nor with respect to the direction or magnitude of any stabilization action taken. Such stabilization action, if commenced, may begin on or after the date of adequate public disclosure of the final terms of the offer of Notes and may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the issue and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court being recognized by the English court as having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and establishing a debt or being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law; - the U.S. judgment not contravening public policy or statute in England and Wales; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and is not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is (i) not a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or (ii) conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; 338 ----- - the U.S. judgment is given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for the settlement of disputes; or - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Accordingly, a judgement rendered by a U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in Denmark. A final judgement properly obtained in a U.S. federal or state court would not be recognized nor enforced by the Danish courts without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated. In connection with any such re-examination, such judgement would generally be accepted as material evidence, but the parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents of the relevant foreign law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead. Further, certain remedies available under U.S. federal or state law may not be allowed in Danish courts, i.e. if they are contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other, punitive damages. The Danish courts may award damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses. Similarly, procedural remedies, including specific rules on the taking of evidence such as the rules on “discovery” in the U.S., may not be available in legal proceedings before Danish courts. Similarly to the above, there can be no certainty that the Danish courts will enforce court judgements or orders obtained in the United States against any of the directors, officers, or other executives of a Danish Guarantor.

211,Offerings 2020.md,522,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,522.3,Switzerland,522.3.1,,"We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding set forth in particular by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische _Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of_ the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include amongst others: - The U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective; 339 ----- - The judgment being final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law, or no ordinary legal remedy being available against such judgment; - The defendant having had the chance to defend itself against any unduly or untimely served complaint except for a defendant that unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before the respective court; - The original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil procedure law, in particular the right to be heard; - The matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter (Verfahren) pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and - The enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht). In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer _Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and_ recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Furthermore, it is not certain that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland, would apply U.S. federal or state laws. The applicable law will be determined in particular in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale _Privatrecht), which may limit the right of the parties to choose the applicable law. As an example, notwithstanding_ a valid choice of law by the parties to an agreement, a court of Switzerland or other authority will not apply a provisions of foreign law if and to the extent that this would, in the court’s or authority’s view, lead to a result violating Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public) or similar general principles. Moreover, a court of Switzerland or other authority will apply, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties, any provisions of Swiss law (and, subject to further conditions, of another foreign law) which in the court’s or authority’s view imperatively demand application in view of their specific purpose (lois d’application immédiate). Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. For example, with respect to the production of evidence, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Swiss law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment annually and management consider if there are any indicators of impairment for non-current assets. We focused on this area because the determination as to whether or not goodwill is impaired involves subjective judgements and estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. On an annual basis, management calculate the amount of headroom between the value in use of the Group’s Cash Generating Units (‘CGU’s) and their carrying value to determine whether there is a potential impairment of the goodwill relating to those CGUs. The value in use of the CGU is dependent on a number of key assumptions which include: - Forecast cash flows for the next four years; - A long-term (terminal) growth rate applied beyond the end of the four year forecast period; and - A discount rate applied to the model. There were no indicators of impairment identified by management. See the accounting policies section within the financial statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, note 3 for the critical judgements and estimates disclosure and note 11 for detailed goodwill disclosures. We understood and evaluated management’s budgeting and forecasting process. We obtained the Group impairment analysis and tested the reasonableness of the key assumptions, including the following: - We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non-current assets being assessed for impairment to the balance sheet. - We challenged management’s calculated Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used for discounting future cashflows within the impairment model, utilising valuation specialists to assess the cost of capital for the Group and comparable organisations. - We traced the forecast financial information within the model to the latest Board approved budget and challenged management to provide support to corroborate trading assumptions, support for capital expenditure and considered the accuracy of previous forecasts. - We evaluated management’s short term growth rate implied in the cash flows for the distinct four year period, obtaining external industry reports to challenge management’s assumption, with no contradictory evidence being identified. - We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and to quantify the downside changes needed before an impairment would be required. We also assessed the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the key assumptions. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
211,Offerings 2020.md,522,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,522.19,Our audit approach,522.19.5,Key audit matter_** **_How our audit addressed the key audit matter Risk of material misstatement in implementing IFRS 16 ‘Leases’,"The Group has adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ on 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach, measuring the ‘Lease Liability’ from transition and the ‘Right of Use asset’ at its carrying value based on application of IFRS 16 from inception of the lease, as permitted by the accounting standard. The adoption of the new accounting standard resulted in the Group recognising a lease liability of £299.4m based on applying an incremental borrowing rate to discount the remaining future lease payments as at 1 January 2019 of £516.6m. An associated right of use asset of £218.8m has also been recognised, along with an adjustment to equity of £70.7m representing the difference between the carrying value of the right of use asset being recognised and the lease liability, along with other financial statement line items at that date (see note 27). We focused on this area because the impact to the Group’s balance sheet is significant and the transition requires management to exercise judgement, in particular in calculating an incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease. There is also a significant impact (increase) on the Group’s main key performance indicator, EBITDA, versus the previous approach under IAS 17. See the accounting policies section for details of the policies applied in the current year and notes 12, 16 and 27 for the disclosures showing the impact of adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 and as at 31 December 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Going concern is considered a key area of focus based on the financial position of the Group and the assessment by management requires subjective judgements and estimates about the future cash flows of the business. Management have performed an assessment of going concern, preparing cash flow forecasts for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving the Group financial statements. In preparing their assessment management have included the cash flows of the Fitness World business acquired on 14 January 2020 and compared these cash flows against the Group’s existing facilities including the bridging loan facility entered into by the Group on 13 January 2020 (see note 28). Management have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, that there are sufficient cash flows to settle liabilities as they fall due in this period and that there is adequate headroom in the banking facilities, including meeting the banking covenant during this We understood and evaluated management’s transition approach, ensuring it was consistent with the requirements of IFRS 16. We obtained the detailed workings and tested the lease inputs, including the following: - A sample of key lease terms, including; payments, start dates and end dates; - A sample of lease modifications and lease remeasurements; - Recalculating of the lease liability and right of use asset; - Recalculating of interest and depreciation; and - Assessing the completeness of leases. The incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is a sensitive assumption that has a significant impact on the resulting lease liability. We challenged management’s IBR through the use of a valuations expert, assessing management’s judgement and challenging the methodology and calculation inputs, taking into account the life of the leases and the current credit rating of the group. We also assessed management’s disclosures relating to the change in accounting policy are consistent with the requirements of IFRS 16. We understood and evaluated management’s cash forecasting process. Management have supported their going concern conclusions by preparing forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and incorporating over this period the cash flows of Fitness World Group which was acquired on 14 January 2020. We obtained these forecasts and tested the key assumptions for reasonableness, including the following: - Understanding the banking facilities available to the Group and associated covenants attached to those facilities. - Considering the components of current liabilities to understand those that represented future cash outflows and those that were non-cash items. - Assessing the consistency between the cash flow forecasts used in management’s going concern assessment and those used for their annual goodwill impairment test. - Assessing whether there are adequate resources throughout the going concern period provided by the bridging facility, which will automatically convert to a term loan repayable in February 2025 from 13 January 2021 should permanent facilities not be put in place prior to this date. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality_** £2,900,000 (2018: £1,800,000). How we determined it_** 2.5% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA'). Rationale for benchmark applied_** Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, EBITDA is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £1,500,000 and £2,700,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York law. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Substantially all of the assets of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and their respective directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any suit, action or proceedings in relation to the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws or other laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Issuer or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions and judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, any Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. While the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is summarized in part below for England and Denmark, you should consult with your own advisors in any relevant jurisdictions to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments. _(b) Operating lease agreements_ #### Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. The notional value of any rent free period and any other lease incentive provided by the landlord is spread on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Financial instruments Financial liabilities The company initially recognises financial liabilities at fair value where applicable (net of any transaction costs) and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. Derivative financial instruments The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps to hedge risks associated with interest rate movements. The Group initially recognises such instruments at fair value where applicable and subsequently remeasures at each balance sheet date. The Group had no separable derivatives at the balance sheet date. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before 31 December 2018 or 1 January 2018 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. In the prior period, the Group assessed at the end of each reporting period whether there was objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets was impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets was impaired and impairment losses were incurred only if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that could be reliably estimated. For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss was measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that had not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset was reduced and the amount of the loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective and therefore have not been applied in these financial statements: • Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ on clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions; • Amendments to IFRS 4 ‘Insurance contracts’ regarding the implementation of IFRS 9; • Amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Prepayment features with negative compensation’ regarding termination rights in order to allow measurement at amortised cost even in the case of negative compensation payments. • Amendments to IAS 28 ‘ Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures’ on clarifying that an entity applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied. • Amendment to IAS 40 ‘Investment property’ relating to transfers of investment property; • IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’; • IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’ • IFRS 16 ‘Leases’; and • IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ Other than in respect of IFRS 16, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements. IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The group has carried out a project to review all of the group’s leasing arrangements in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the group’s operating leases. As at the reporting date, the group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £522.1m (see note 22), all of which are long term and thus impacted by adoption of IFRS 16. The group expects to recognise right-of-use assets of approximately £217.8m on 1 January 2019, and lease liabilities of £302.4m (after adjustments for prepayments and accrued lease payments recognised as at 31 December 2018).

Adjusted EBITDA as presented in the Strategic Report will not be impacted. Operating cash inflows will increase and financing cash inflows decrease by approximately £7.5m as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities will be classified as cash flows from financing activities. #### 3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. #### (a) Impairment of non-financial assets The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based on the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including carrying values is included in note 12. #### (b) Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment The annual deprecation charge for property, plant and equipment is sensitive to changes in the estimates useful economic lives and residual values of the assets. The assessment of useful economic lives and residual values is determined to be a critical accounting judgement and is re-assessed annually. They are amended when necessary to reflect current estimates, based on technological advancement, future investments, economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets. See note 11 for the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment and note 2 for the useful economic lives for each class of assets. (c) Recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. The calculation of the deferred tax asset is based on an estimation of the likely taxes due which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate determination of certain items.  Where the actual tax position differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on the income tax and the deferred tax asset in the period when such determination is made.

The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment annually and management consider if there are any indicators of impairment for non-current assets. No impairment charge has been recorded by management in the current year. We focused on this area because the determination as to whether or not goodwill is impaired involves subjective judgements and estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. On an annual basis, management calculate the amount of headroom between the value in use of the Group’s Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) and their carrying value to determine whether there is a potential impairment of the goodwill relating to those CGUs. The value in use of the CGU is dependent on a number of key assumptions which include: - Forecast cash flows for the next five years; - A long-term (terminal) growth rate applied beyond the end of the five year forecast period; and - A discount rate applied to the model. There were no indicators of impairment identified by management. See the accounting policies section within the financial statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates and Note 12 for detailed goodwill disclosures. _Risk of material misstatement in acquisition accounting_ During the period the Group acquired the Gym Topco Limited group for £308.2m and Ovalhouse Limited for £18.8m and have accounted for the acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, generating goodwill of £460.2m. Accounting for business combinations under IFRS 3 requires management to make judgements and estimates, in particular with respect to the identification and valuation of intangible assets and any fair value adjustments on assets and liabilities acquired. Intangible assets of £58.7m associated with the Pure Gym brand and £8.2m for customer relationships were recognised and were allocated useful economic lives (‘UEL’) of 20 years and 9 months respectively. There were no intangible assets recognised as part of the acquisition of Ovalhouse Limited. We understood and evaluated management’s budgeting and forecasting process. We obtained the group impairment analysis and tested the reasonableness of the key assumptions, including the following: - We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non-current assets being assessed for impairment to the balance sheet. - We challenged management’s calculated group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used for discounting future cashflows within the impairment model, utilising valuation specialists to assess the cost of capital for the group and comparable organisations. - We traced the forecast financial information within the model to the latest Board approved budget and challenged management to provide support to corroborate trading assumptions, support for capital expenditure and considered the accuracy of previous forecasts. - We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions and to quantify the downside changes needed before an impairment would be required at the CGU level. We determined that the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the WACC are appropriate. For both acquisitions: - We read the sale and purchase agreement to understand the terms of the transaction and obtained management’s analysis of the book and fair values of the acquired balance sheet on the acquisition date. - We agreed the book values of the items on the acquisition balance sheets to underlying records and performed appropriate substantive procedures. - We assessed management’s work on the identification and valuation of intangible assets, including the appropriateness of the assumptions used and the UELs assigned to the identified intangible assets, utilising valuation specialists in that work. For the acquisition of Ovalhouse we assessed management’s conclusions that there were no intangible assets recognised. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued) _Risk of material misstatement in acquisition accounting (continued) Going Concern_ During the current period the Group has made a loss before tax and has net liabilities and net current liabilities at the balance sheet date. Going concern is considered a key area of focus based on the financial position of the group and the assessment by management requires subjective judgements and estimates about the future cash flows of the business. Management have performed an assessment of going concern, preparing cash flow forecasts for a period of at least 12 months from the anticipated date of approving the group financial statements. Management have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, that there are sufficient cash flows to settle liabilities as they fall due in this period and that there is adequate headroom in the banking facilities, including meeting the banking covenant during this period. _How we tailored the audit scope_ - We assessed the business combinations disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and concluded that they are in accordance with IFRS 3. We understood and evaluated management’s cash forecasting process. Management have supported their going concern conclusions by preparing forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. We obtained these forecasts and tested the key assumptions for reasonableness, including the following: Understanding the banking facilities available to the group and associated covenants attached to those facilities. Considering the components of current liabilities to understand those that represented future cash outflows and those that were non-cash items. Assessing the consistency between the cash flow forecasts used in management’s going concern assessment and those used for their annual goodwill impairment test. We also performed sensitivity analysis to ascertain the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would result in either a breach of the banking covenants or the group exceeding available bank facilities. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates. All business activities are within the UK and subject to audit by the group engagement team, the significant majority of trading is undertaken by the Pure Gym Limited component. _Materiality_ The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall group materiality_** £1,800,000 (2017: not applicable - first year audit). How we determined it_** 2.5% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’). Rationale for benchmark applied_** We believe that EBITDA is a primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £1,250,000 and £1,750,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued) _Materiality (continued)_ We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £90,000 (2017: not applicable - first year audit) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all ----- of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued) _Key audit matters_ Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below. _Strategic Report and Directors’ Report_ In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the period ended 31 December 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- ## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued) _Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_ Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. _Use of this report_ This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. ### Other required reporting",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet by lessees, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The group is undertaking a project to review all of the group’s leasing arrangements in light of the new lease accounting rules in IFRS 16. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the group’s operating leases. As at the reporting date, the group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £522.1m (see note 22), all of which are long term and thus impacted by adoption of IFRS 16. The group expects to recognise right-of-use assets of approximately £217.8m on 1 January 2019, and lease liabilities of £302.4m (after adjustments for prepayments and accrued lease payments recognised as at 31 December 2018). Overall net liabilities will be approximately £79.3m higher (before adjusting for deferred tax assets to be recognised), and net current liabilities will be £2.3m higher due to the difference between current liabilities recognised under IFRS 16 and the IAS 17 deferred rent accrual. ----- #### At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective and therefore have not been applied in these financial statements: • Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’ on clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions; • Amendments to IFRS 4 ‘Insurance contracts’ regarding the implementation of IFRS 9; • Amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Prepayment features with negative compensation’ regarding termination rights in order to allow measurement at amortised cost even in the case of negative compensation payments. • Amendments to IAS 28 ‘ Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures’ on clarifying that an entity applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied. • Amendment to IAS 40 ‘Investment property’ relating to transfers of investment property; • IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’; • IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’ • IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’; • IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers'; • IFRS 16 ‘Leases’; and • IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ Other than in respect of IFRS 16, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements. IFRS 16 will require most operating leases to be brought onto the balance sheet. The directors are currently assessing the impact that the application of this standard will have on the Group financial statements. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. #### (a) Impairment of non-financial assets The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based on the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including carrying values is included in note 12. #### (b) Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment The annual deprecation charge for property, plant and equipment is sensitive to changes in the estimates, useful economic lives and residual values of the assets. The assessment of useful economic lives and residual values is determined to be a critical accounting judgement and is re-assessed annually. They are amended when necessary to reflect current estimates, based on technological advancement, future investments, economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets. See note 11 for the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment and note 2 for the useful economic lives for each class of assets. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a four-year period. EBITDA projections reflect the maturity profile of the existing estate and the key assumptions are: average annual capital expenditure of £17.4m on existing sites (2016: £13.7m), pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2016: 10%) and a long term growth rate of 2% (2016: 2%).

In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities. #### Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer).

Following the acquisition of Soho Gyms, non-recurring costs of £637,000 were incurred in the year associated with the transition and integration of Soho Gyms into the PureGym model (2017: £20,000 relating to the transition and integration of LA Fitness). During the prior year, the PureGym group was sold to Leonard Green & Partners and in doing so recognised exceptional transaction expenses of £14,144,000 in the year ended 31 December 2017 and residual costs of £266,000 in the current year. #### During the year ended 31 December 2016, the group made plans to proceed with an initial public offering (“IPO”) of PureGym onto the London Stock Exchange.

The amounts set out above include remuneration in respect of the highest paid director as follows: 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Emoluments **851** 820 ----- #### The key management of the group are deemed to be the same as the directors of the group, therefore no additional disclosure of key management compensation has been provided. ----- #### 9 Finance costs 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Interest on bank loans and overdrafts **46** 13,783 Finance lease interest **301** 501 Commitment fees **92** 439 Amortisation of capitalised finance costs **-** 6,928 Preference share interest **-** 2,951 Loan note interest **-** 10,708 Interest payable to group undertakings **28,171** 2,266 Other **47** 251 28,657** 37,827 #### Interest and finance charges paid for financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss totalled £28,518,000 (2017: £30,209,000). 10 Income tax 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Current tax: - UK corporation tax on profits for the year **1,396** 753 - Adjustments in respect of prior periods **(250) Total current tax charge **1,146** 753 Deferred tax: - Origination and reversal of timing differences **2,078** 2,846 - Adjustments in respect of prior periods **53** (46) - Effect of changes in tax rates **(235) Total deferred tax charge **1,896** 2,800 Total tax charge in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 3,042** 3,553 ----- #### 10 Income tax (continued) The tax charge for the year is higher (2017: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 19% (2017: 19.25%). The differences are explained below: 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Profit / (loss) on ordinary activities before tax **14,417** (14,497) Tax on profit / loss on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% (2017: 19.25%) **2,739** (2,791) Effects of: - Fixed asset differences **1,769** 1,645 - Expenses not deductible for tax purposes **182** 5,532 - Impact of rate differences **(235)** (458) - Unrelieved tax losses and other deductions **63** (30) - Adjustments in respect of prior periods **(428)** (46) - Deferred tax not recognised **66** (260) - Amounts claimed for group relief for nil consideration **(1,114) Total tax charge for the year** **3,042** 3,553 #### The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK remained at 19% throughout the period and accordingly the company’s profits for this period are taxed at an effective rate of 19% (2017: 19.25%). Deferred tax has been measured at 17% in these financial statements as that is the rate at which the timing differences are expected to reverse. Factors that may affect future tax charges Legislation to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in the budget on 16 March 2017 and was substantively enacted on 6 September 2017. Accordingly deferred tax has been provided at the rate at which the temporary difference is expected to reverse. ----- #### 10 Income tax (continued) #### 10 Income tax (continued) At the year end, the group had losses from certain group companies carried forward for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised. These losses totalled £13,376,000 (2017: £13,550,000) and the unrecognised deferred tax asset totalled £2,274,000 (2017: £1,423,000). The asset has not been recognised as the directors are of the opinion that it is unlikely that suitable taxable profits will arise in these entities in the foreseeable future. #### 11 Property, plant and equipment #### 11 Property, plant and equipment (continued) #### 12 Intangible assets (continued) generating unit (CGU) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a fouryear period. All goodwill has been allocated to the single identified CGU, being “Gyms”. EBITDA projections reflect the maturity profile of the existing estate and the key assumptions are: average annual capital expenditure of £23.1m on existing sites (2017: £17.4m), pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2017: 10%) and a long term growth rate of 2% (2017: 2%). Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and current plans for site refurbishments. The pre-tax discount rate reflects specific risks relating to the Group and the market in which it operates. The long-term growth rate is determined based on a combination of industry and countrylevel forecasts. There is sufficient headroom such that any reasonable sensitivity performed does not reduce the recoverable amount to lower than carrying value. #### 13 Inventories 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Finished goods and goods for resale **1,278** 1,160 #### Inventories recognised as an expense during the year ended 31 December 2018 amounted to £2,962,000 (2017: £3,110,000). These were included in administrative expenses. 14 Trade and other receivables Current 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 Trade receivables **783** 609 Loss allowance **- Trade receivables – net **783** 609 Prepayments **13,470** 11,951 Other debtors **3,310** 2,917 17,563** 15,477 #### The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 month before 31 December and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it ----- #### 14 Trade and other receivables (continued) sells its services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 is £nil as all trade receivables are current and the expected loss rate for the group is 0% (2017: £nil and 0% respectively). #### 16 Borrowings #### At 31 December 2018, the Group was not drawn down on the facility. The group has been in compliance with all covenants during the current and prior financial years. ----- #### 16 Borrowings (continued) Finance leases **2018** **2017 £’000** **£’000** Commitments in relation to finance leases are payable as follows: Within one year **1,208** 1,208 Later than one year and not later than five years **2,720** 3,927 Minimum lease payments - commitments** **3,928** 5,135 Future finance charges **(394)** (666) Recognised as a liability** **3,534** 4,469 The present value of finance lease liabilities is as follows: Within one year **1,006** 934 Later than one year and not later than five years **2,528** 3,535 Minimum lease payments – present value** **3,534** 4,469 #### Finance leases are secured against the assets to which they relate. 17 Financial instruments #### 27 Financial instruments (continued) Set out below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all the financial instruments as carried in the financial statements, other than finance leases and those for which the fair value approximates closely with their carrying value. The fair value of all borrowings are calculated by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a Level 2 valuation. Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the value measurements: • Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets • Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active markets; and • Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique. There were no transfers between levels throughout the period under review. All liabilities listed below are categorised as Level 2. #### 18 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued) As at 31 December 2018 the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments by way of finance leases and amounts owed to group undertakings. At 31 December 2017 (after taking into account the effect of interest rate caps and finance leases), 29% of the group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities: #### 19 Share capital, premium and other reserves 2018** **2018** 2017 2017 £’000** **No.** £’000 No. 2018** 2017 £’000** £’000 _Adjustments for:_ Net finance cost **28,202** 37,757 Depreciation **30,008** 26,382 Amortisation **-** 229 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment **1,177** 732 Share based payments **248 Exceptional costs **1,771** 13,802 Changes in working capital Inventories **(83)** (45) Trade and other receivables **(1,111)** (2,699) Trade and other creditors **16,861** 7,565 Cash generated from operations** **91,490** 69,226 ----- #### 21  Analysis of net debt #### 23 Controlling party (continued) The ultimate controlling party is Leonard Green & Partners LP, 11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, California 90025, United States of America. 24 Interests in other entities _In the opinion of the directors, the Group has a single principal subsidiary at 31 December 2018, Pure Gym Limited. This company is 100% owned by the group, is incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its principal activity is the provision of facilities for physical fitness._ #### 25 Related party transactions A former director of the company, P W D Roberts is a partner in Countrywide Leisure Management which was a related party until 30 November 2017. During the year the partnership was paid management fees (including directors fees and office rental) of £nil (2017: £146,000). Yes Mail Interactive is a company controlled by former shareholder, CCMP Capital LP and was a related party until 30 November 2017. During the year the company was paid £nil (2017: £324,000) for marketing services. At the year-end an amount of £nil was due to Yes Mail Interactive (2017: £32,000). CCMP Capital Advisors LP was a shareholder and related party of the group until 30 November 2017. During the year the group paid monitoring fees of £nil (2017: £60,000) to CCMP Capital Advisors LP and reimbursed them for expenses incurred of £nil (2017: £17,000). As at 31 December 2018, amounts owed to fellow group companies includes £367,127,000 owed to the immediate parent company, Pinnacle Bidco PLC (2017: £335,795000 owed to Pinnacle Bidco PLC and £2,482,000 due from Pinnacle Bidco PLC), repayable on 30 November 2027, and £116,000 (2017: £nil) owed to the ultimate parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited. Associated net interest charged to the income statement totals £27,793,000 (2017: £2,248,000). 26 Business combinations On 21 June 2018, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ovalhouse Limited for cash consideration of £18,754,000 with £18,254,000 cash paid on completion and £500,000 deferred, pending successful extension of a property lease, which remains outstanding at 31 December 2018. Ovalhouse Limited is registered in the United Kingdom and provides physical fitness facilities across 10 gyms in the London region under the brand of “Soho Gyms”. As a result of the acquisition, the group is expected to increase its presence in the market. It also expects to reduce costs through economies of scale. The goodwill of £18,558,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the attractive property portfolio and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the group and Soho Gyms. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. ----- #### 26 Business combinations (continued) The following table summarises the consideration paid for Soho Gyms and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. #### Cash and cash equivalents In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities. #### Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) #### 3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions (continued) (c) Recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. The calculation of the deferred tax asset is based on an estimation of the likely taxes due which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate determination of certain items.  Where the actual tax position differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on the income tax and the deferred tax asset in the period when such determination is made. Detail of the tax charge and deferred tax asset are set out in note 10. 4 Revenue _Revenue relates wholly to sales in the United Kingdom and is analysed by service or product as follows:_ #### 5 Operating profit (continued) A reconciliation from operating profit to Group EBITDA is as follows: #### 7 Auditors’ remuneration _The remuneration of the auditors is analysed as follows:_ #### 8 Employees and directors (continued) Total emoluments relating to Directors are as follows: #### 10 Income tax #### 10 Income tax (continued) The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK was 19% throughout the period and accordingly the company’s profits for this period are taxed at this rate. Deferred tax has been measured at 17% in these financial statements as that is the rate at which the timing differences are expected to reverse. Factors that may affect future tax charges Legislation to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in the budget on 16 March 2017 and was substantively enacted on 6 September 2017. Accordingly deferred tax has been provided at the rate at which the temporary difference is expected to reverse. #### 10 Income tax (continued) #### 11 Property, plant and equipment #### 12 Intangible assets (continued) Additions to goodwill in the period consisted of £441,657,000 in respect of the acquisition of Gym Topco Limited and £18,558,000 in respect of the acquisition of Ovalhouse Limited (see note 26). Brands and customer relationships were capitalised at fair value in relation to the acquisition of Gym Topco Limited in November 2017. At 31 December 2018, the net book value attributable to Pure Gym customer relationships was £nil, with related amortisation of £8,204,000 included in administrative expenses for the period. Net book value attributable to the brands acquired through Gym Topco Limited was £55,491,000, with related amortisation of £3,178,000 included in administrative expenses for the period. The remaining amortisation period of the brands at 31 December 2018 is 18 years, 11 months. No other intangible assets were identified in respect of the acquisition of Ovalhouse Limited. Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a four-year period. All goodwill has been allocated to the single identified CGU, being “Gyms”. EBITDA projections reflect the maturity profile of the existing estate and the key assumptions are: average annual capital expenditure of £23.1m on existing sites, pre-tax discount rate of 10% and a long-term growth rate of 2%. Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and current plans for site refurbishments. The pre-tax discount rate reflects specific risks relating to the Group and the market in which it operates. The long-term growth rate is determined based on a combination of industry and countrylevel forecasts. There is sufficient headroom such that any reasonable sensitivity performed does not reduce the recoverable amount to lower than carrying value. #### 13 Inventories **2018 £’000** Finished goods and goods for resale **1,278 #### Inventories recognised as an expense during the period ended 31 December 2018 amounted to £3,128,000.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 is £nil as all trade receivables are current and the expected loss rate for the group is 0%. 15 Trade and other payables **2018 £’000** Trade creditors **13,705 Other taxation and social security **650 Other liabilities **1,027 Accruals **39,897 Contract liabilities – membership income **11,705 Deferred rent accrual **5,238 Corporation tax payable **497 VAT payable **3,981 **76,700** #### The deferred rent accrual relates to accumulated difference between cash rentals paid and rental charges from operating leases in the income statement and is outside the scope of IAS 39 (financial instruments). The amounts included in contract liabilities are expected to be recognised in revenue during the next reporting period. ----- #### 16 Borrowings #### 16 Borrowings (continued) Financing (continued) The revolving credit facility is repayable on 30 November 2024, secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of the company and certain of its subsidiaries and subject to a financial covenant of net leverage ratio lower than or equal to 7.7 when drawdown of the facility is greater than 40%. At 31 December 2018, the Group was not drawn down on the facility. The group has been in compliance with all covenants during the current financial period. Finance leases **2018 £’000** Commitments in relation to finance leases are payable as follows: Within one year **1,208 Later than one year and not later than five years **2,720 #### 17 Financial instruments #### 18 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk, credit risk, and market risk arising from interest rate risk. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The key market risk affecting the group is interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain borrowings and deposits. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. During the period, the Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates related primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates. As at 31 December 2018 the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments by way of senior secured loan notes, amounts owed to group undertakings, and finance leases. The Group has access to a £60m revolving credit facility with floating interest rates but was not drawn down on this facility at the end of the period. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities: #### 19 Share capital and premium #### obtained from the registered office: Town Centre House, Merrion Centre, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS2 8LY.

Associated interest charged to the income statement totals £26,065,000. 26 Business combinations _Gym Topco Limited_ #### On 30 November 2017, Pinnacle Bidco Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Gym Topco Limited (“the PureGym group”) for £308,236,000. The principal activity of the PureGym group is the provision of physical fitness facilities. The goodwill of £441,657,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired workforce, and anticipated future earnings from future new customers. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. ----- #### 26 Business combinations (continued) The following table summarises the consideration paid for Gym Topco Limited and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired: #### 26 Business combinations (continued) _Ovalhouse Limited_ #### On 21 June 2018, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ovalhouse Limited for cash consideration of £18,754,000 with £18,254,000 cash paid on completion and £500,000 deferred, pending successful extension of a property lease, which remains outstanding at 31 December 2018.

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) Trade and other payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. #### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) #### 3 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. #### (a) Impairment of non-financial assets The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based on the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including carrying values is included in note 12. #### (b) Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment The annual deprecation charge for property, plant and equipment is sensitive to changes in the estimates useful economic lives and residual values of the assets. The assessment of useful economic lives and residual values is determined to be a critical accounting judgement and is re-assessed annually. They are amended when necessary to reflect current estimates, based on technological advancement, future investments, economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets. See note 11 for the carrying amount of the property plant and equipment and note 2 for the useful economic lives for each class of assets. (c) Recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted. The calculation of the deferred tax asset is based on an estimation of the likely taxes due which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate determination of certain items.  Where the actual tax position differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on the income tax and the deferred tax asset in the period when such determination is made. Detail of the tax charge and deferred tax asset are set out in note 10. ----- #### 4 Revenue _Revenue relates wholly to sales in the United Kingdom and is analysed by service or product as follows:_ 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Member income **183,549** 147,451 Vending income **5,520** 4,621 Other income **8,963** 7,865 198,032** 159,937 #### 5 Operating profit 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Costs relating to the sale of the group **14,144 Costs relating to acquisition of the LA Fitness Group **-** 361 Integration and transition costs **20** 2,315 Impairment of tangible fixed assets **-** 3,260 Costs relating to the aborted Initial Public Offering **(362)** 6,776 13,802** 12,712 #### On 30 November 2017 Gym Topco Limited and subsidiaries was sold to the Leonard Green group and in doing so the group recognised exceptional transaction fees of £14,144,000 (2016: £nil). In 2015 the Group purchased the LA Fitness Group and in doing so incurred residual transaction costs of £361,000 in the prior year. Residual costs associated with the transition and integration of LA Fitness into the Pure Gym model of £20,000 were incurred in the year (2016: £2,315,000). Exceptional impairment charges of £3,260,000 were also recognised in the prior year against certain items of property, plant and equipment to reflect their expected on-going value in use. During the year ended 31 December 2016 the group made plans to proceed with an initial public offering (“IPO”) of Pure Gym onto the London Stock Exchange. Subsequently the group decided that executing an IPO in volatile market conditions would not be in the long-term interests of the group and its stakeholders and decided not to proceed. Exceptional costs incurred in connection with this totalled £6,776,000 in the year ended 31 December 2016 and following confirmation of previously estimated fees, a credit of £362,000 arose in the current year upon release of surplus accruals. 7 Auditors’ remuneration _The remuneration of the auditors are analysed as follows:_ 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Audit of the parent company and group financial statements **8** 7 Audit of subsidiary financial statements **97** 95 Other assurance services **686** 992 791** 1,094 #### Other assurance services in the current and prior year relate to exceptional costs incurred in connection with the sale of the Group to the Leonard Green group and the aborted IPO respectively (note 6). ----- #### 8 Employees and directors 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Wages and salaries **22,699** 19,387 Social security costs **2,242** 1,906 Other pension costs **304** 262 25,245** 21,555 #### The group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all employees using a master trust (occupational trust-based) pension scheme. The total cost expensed in the year was £304,000 (2016: £262,000) and outstanding pension contributions at the year-end totalled £43,000 (2016: £38,000). On 30 November 2017 the Directors and certain employees subscribed for 630,000 Ordinary A1 and A2 shares in Pinnacle Topco Limited. These shares have service and vesting conditions attached and are therefore in the scope of IFRS 2 'Share based payments'. The directors have applied a Black-Scholes model to calculate a grant date fair value of these shares for IFRS 2 purposes as £2.39 per share, concluding that the total charge and charge in any given period will not be material. Consequently, no share based payment charge has been recorded in these financial statements. The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the group during the year was made up as follows: 2017** 2016 No.** No. Central support **243** 211 Operations **520** 465 763** 676 #### Total emoluments relating to Directors are as follows: 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Aggregate emoluments **1,459** 1,112 Contributions to defined contribution schemes **6** 5 1,465** 1,117 #### Two directors were members of the defined contribution scheme as at 31 December 2017 (2016: two).

Deferred tax has been measured at 17% in these financial statements as that is the rate at which the timing differences are expected to reverse. Factors that may affect future tax charges Legislation to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax from 19% to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced in the budget on 16 March 2016 and was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. Accordingly deferred tax has been provided at the rate at which the temporary difference is expected to reverse. ----- #### 10 Income tax (continued) #### 10 Income tax (continued) _The movement in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows:_ #### 11 Property, plant and equipment #### 12 Intangible assets #### 14 Trade and other receivables 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Trade receivables **609** 222 Less provision for impairment of trade receivables **-** (29) Trade receivables – net **609** 193 Prepayments and accrued income **11,951** 10,560 Other debtors **2,917** 1,977 15,477** 12,730 #### The average credit period taken for trade receivables is 36 days (2016: 54 days). As of 31 December 2017, trade receivables of £nil (2016: £nil) were past due but not impaired. As of 31 December 2017, trade receivables of £nil (2016: £35,000) were impaired.

All of the Group's receivables are denominated in Sterling. The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain assets which are considered to be impaired. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. 15 Trade and other payables 2017** 2016 £’000** £’000 Trade creditors **14,458** 11,475 Other taxation and social security **1,636** 466 Other liabilities **1,377** 766 Accruals **15,482** 20,654 Deferred income **10,416** 8,176 Deferred rent accrual **26,075** 22,522 VAT payable **947** 1,426 70,391** 65,485 #### The deferred rent accrual relates to accumulated difference between cash rentals paid and rental charges from operating leases in the income statement and is outside the scope of IAS 39 (financial instruments). ----- #### 16 Borrowings #### 16 Borrowings (continued) Bank loans and overdrafts (continued) The new facilities are held by parent company, Pinnacle Bidco plc and are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of certain subsidiaries of the Gym Topco group. The £60 million revolving facility is subject to quarterly covenant testing of its leverage ratio. Prior to the refinancing, the group was party to a £240 million committed financing facility with four international banks (Ares Management, Barclays Bank, Goldman Sachs and Haymarket Financial, collectively ""the Lenders""). This facility consisted of a £150 million term loan, a £75 million capex facility and a £15 million overdraft facility and was subject to quarterly covenant testing of the following ratios: fixed charge cover, adjusted leverage and maximum levels of capital expenditure. All outstanding amounts under this facility were repaid in full on 30 November 2017. The group has been in compliance with all covenants during the current and prior financial years. Finance leases Finance leases are secured against the assets to which they relate. Loan notes During the year the group had £90,969,506 unsecured, non-convertible loan notes in issue accruing interest at a fixed rate of 9.4% (2016: £90,969,506), with principal and interest repayable in full on 23 May 2021, or earlier on sale of the business. On completion of the sale of the Group to the Leonard Green group on 30 November 2017, the loan notes and related interest were repaid in full. Preference shares The Preferred A Ordinary shares accrued fixed interest at 9.4% of the issue price On completion of the sale of the group to the Leonard Green group on 30 November 2017, the preference shares were converted to ordinary share capital (note 19) and the cumulative accrued interest of £14,822,505 was converted to an amount payable to the new parent company (Pinnacle Bidco plc) and then subsequently waived, creating a capital contribution reserve. ----- #### 17 Financial instruments The Group entered into an interest rate cap to restrict the LIBOR element of interest payable on £100 million of its drawn borrowings at a rate not higher than 1.75%. In accordance with IAS 39, the cap is considered to be closely related to the debt instrument and has therefore not been recognised separately as an embedded derivative. The premium payable to acquire the cap is amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the term of the debt. The Group does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. All of the group’s financial instruments are classified as loans and receivables. Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the financial instruments as carried in the financial statements. The fair value of financial derivatives and borrowings are calculated by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a Level 2 valuation, as detailed below: Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the value measurements: • Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets • Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active markets; and • Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique. There were no transfers between levels throughout the periods under review. The fair values of the other financial instruments approximates closely with their carrying values. #### 18 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The key market risk affecting the group is interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 December 2017 and 2016. The analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives are all constant. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. During the year, the Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates related primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates. As at 31 December 2017 the Group had a temporary bridging facility in place and therefore only 1% of its borrowings were in fixed rate instruments by way of finance leases (2016: 44% by way of shareholder loans and finance leases with exposure on the remaining bank borrowings managed by entering into interest rate derivatives, in which it agreed to cap rates or exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount). At 31 December 2017 (after taking into account the effect of interest rate caps and finance leases), 29% of the group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest (2016: 70%, taking account of interest rate caps, shareholder loans and finance leases). On 24 January 2018, the temporary bridging facility was exchanged for £360 million of senior notes at a fixed rate of 6.375% (see note 25) thereby limiting the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk going forwards to that on the £60 million revolving credit facility only. As a result, the annual impact of a notional 0.5% interest rate movement on its drawn debt as at 31 December 2017 is limited to its overdraft and equates to £25,000 (2016: £1,075,000 relating to £215 million of drawn bank debt). Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities: ----- #### 18 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued) #### 19 Share capital and premium (continued) On 30 November 2017 the company reduced the nominal value of the ordinary B shares from £0.01 to £0.0001, reduced the nominal value of the ordinary C shares from £0.01 to £0.0001 and reduced the value of the ordinary D shares from £0.0003 to £0.0001. On the same day the company re-designated the preferred A, ordinary B, ordinary C and ordinary D shares to a new class of ordinary shares.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred.

In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate using the interest rates from recent third party financing received as a starting point. This rate is then adjusted to make it specific to the lease based on the lease term and security. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: - fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; and - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss as ‘profit on lease modifications’ if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets as part of ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities as a separate line item in the statement of financial position. A small number of property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated from a particular gym. For individual gyms, up to 100% of lease payments are on the basis of variable payment terms with a range of percentages as a proportion of sales. Variable lease payments that depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right- of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. #### Policies applicable prior to 1 January 2019 Leases _(a) Finance lease agreements_ #### Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the statement of financial position as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated in accordance with the above depreciation policies. Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments. _(b) Operating lease agreements_ #### Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. The notional value of any rent free period or any other lease incentive provided by the landlord is spread on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. Financial instruments Financial liabilities The company initially recognises financial liabilities at fair value where applicable (net of any transaction costs) and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest method over the life of the loan. Derivative financial instruments The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or foreign currency forward contracts to hedge risks associated with interest rate movements or foreign exchange. The Group initially recognises such instruments at fair value where applicable and subsequently remeasures at each balance sheet date. Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets as ‘those to be measured at amortised cost’ or ‘those to be measured subsequently at fair value’.

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are Grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. #### Cash and cash equivalents In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.

Management assess the likelihood of a liability arising based on the contractual obligations included within leases and an assessment of the likelihood that the company will become liable for such obligations as a result of tenancies coming to an end and not being subsequently renewed. Where it is determined that such a liability is probable, an estimate is made as to the amount and timing of future cash flows required to settle the liability, and a provision is made for this liability, discounted to present value. Where it is determined that the probability of such a liability is remote, no provision is recognised. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. At 31 December 2019, the provision recognised is £100,000 (31 December 2018: £nil). Incremental borrowing rate for discounting of lease liabilities The company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments in the calculation of lease liabilities. The use of this method requires critical judgements over the impact on the incremental borrowing rate of relevant factors such as lease length and quality of security. Management utilise internal and external information to determine an appropriate rate. More information including the weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied is included in note 27.

As explained in note 27, the company has applied IFRS 16 (Leases) from 1 January 2019 with no retrospective restatement of the results of 2018. As a result, most lease costs are excluded from Group EBITDA and operating profit in 2019, but were included in 2018. #### 6 Exceptional administrative expenses Items that are material either because of their size or their nature, and that are non-recurring are considered as exceptional items and are presented within the line items to which they best relate. These items are analysed further below: 14 month period ended 31 December 2018 £’000 Costs relating to acquisitions **4,787** 868 Integration, transition and restructuring costs **2,166** 637 Exploration of acquisition and expansion opportunities **1,341 Costs relating to the purchase and sale of the Group **-** 4,180 8,294** 5,685 In the year ended 31 December 2019, the company incurred costs related to the acquisition of the Fitness World Group (see note 28), as well as other gym acquisitions. Total costs related to these acquisitions in 2019 were £4,787,000. In the 14 month period ended 31 December 2018, £868,000 was incurred in relation to the acquisition of Ovalhouse Limited. #### 6 Exceptional administrative expenses (continued) In addition, £2,166,000 of costs were incurred in 2019 relating to the transition and integration of Soho Gyms into the PureGym model and the restructuring of certain operations in the existing business (14 month period ended 31 December 2018: £637,000).

The total cost expensed in the year was £834,000 (14 month period ended 31 December 2018: £526,000) and outstanding pension contributions at the year-end were £nil (31 December 2018: £94,000). 8 Employees and directors (continued) The Directors and certain employees hold ordinary A1 and A2 shares in the company, which have service and vesting conditions attached and are therefore in the scope of IFRS 2 'Share based payments'. The directors have applied a Black-Scholes model to calculate a grant date fair value of these shares for IFRS 2 purposes as £2.39 per share. Consequently, a charge of £306,000 has been recognised during the year (14 month period ended 31 December 2018: £248,000) and is included within wages and salaries.

The remaining amortisation period of the Brands at 31 December 2019 is 17 years, 11 months. Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the Group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a four-year period. All goodwill has been allocated to the Group of CGUs to which it relates, being “Gyms”. EBITDA projections reflect the maturity profile of the existing estate and the key assumptions are: average annual capital expenditure of £25.4m (2018: £23.1m) on existing sites, pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2018: 10%) and a long-term growth rate of 2% (2018: 2%). Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and current plans for site refurbishments. The pre-tax discount rate reflects specific risks relating to the Group and the market in which it operates. The long-term growth rate is determined based on a combination of industry and countrylevel forecasts. There is sufficient headroom such that any reasonable sensitivity performed does not reduce the recoverable amount to lower than carrying value. F 32 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The key market risk affecting the Group is interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain borrowings and deposits. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. During the period, the Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates related primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates. As at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments by way of senior secured loan notes, amounts owed to Group undertakings, and finance leases. The Group has access to a £60m revolving credit facility with floating interest rates but was not drawn down on this facility at the end of the period. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves.

211,Offerings 2020.md,528,NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED),528.67,,528.67.1,,"#### Intangible assets _(a) Goodwill_ #### Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or Groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or Group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Each gym is considered to be a CGU and goodwill is assessed at the Group of CGUs level, i.e. across all gyms together. Goodwill is not amortised, instead impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. The non-amortisation of goodwill is a departure from the Companies Act 2006 requirements, however this is considered a true and fair override due to the indefinite life of the goodwill. This is an alignment with the requirements of IAS 38 for the non-amortisation of goodwill. _(b) Intangible assets acquired in business combinations_ #### The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement utilising valuation expertise and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore, management must estimate the expected useful life of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly, the value of which is shown within administrative expenses. The useful life estimated for customer lists is 1 year and for brands it is 20 years, and these assets are amortised on a straight line basis.

Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in the profit or loss. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. #### 4 Revenue _Revenue relates wholly to sales in the United Kingdom and is analysed by service or product as follows:_ #### 5 Operating profit (continued) A reconciliation from operating profit to Group EBITDA is as follows: In the year ended 31 December 2019, the company also incurred costs of £1,341,000 in relation to the exploration of acquisition and expansion opportunities (14 month period ended 31 December 2018: £nil). In November 2017, the PureGym Group was acquired by Leonard Green & Partners and expenses totalling £4,180,000 were incurred in the 14 month period ended 31 December 2018 relating to the sale. All projects ongoing at 31 December 2019 are expected to complete in 2020. #### 7 Auditors’ remuneration _The remuneration of the auditors is analysed as follows:_ #### The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the Group during the period was made up as follows: #### 10 Income tax #### 10 Income tax (continued) #### 10 Income tax (continued) #### 11 Intangible assets (continued) #### 12 Property, plant and equipment #### 12 Property, plant and equipment (continued) #### 12 Property, plant and equipment (continued) The recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets: #### 14 Trade and other receivables _Current_ 2019** 2018 £’000** £’000 Trade receivables **865** 783 Loss allowance **- Trade receivables – net **865** 783 Prepayments **15,643** 13,470 Other debtors **5,324** 3,310 Finance lease receivable **91 21,923** 17,563 #### The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been Grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2019 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it sells its services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. On that basis, the loss allowance on trade receivables and other debtors as at 31 December 2019 is £nil (31 December 2018: £nil) as all trade receivables and other debtors are current and the expected loss rate for the Group is 0% (31 December 2018: 0%).

The following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease receivables showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date. Income receivable from finance leases is presented within finance income (note 9).

Revenue recognised during 2019 that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period totalled £11,705,000 (2018: £nil).

F 46 ----- #### 27 Change in accounting policies This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019. The Group has adopted IFRS 16 retrospectively from 1 January 2019, but has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in the standard, where the modified retrospective transition approach has been adopted. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 January 2019. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘operating leases’ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on 1 January 2019 was 9.2%. For leases previously classified as finance leases the entity recognised the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability immediately before transition as the carrying amount of the right of use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement principles of IFRS 16 are only applied after that date. The transition did not result in any measurement adjustments. In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard: • the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics • the consideration of the full lease term in determining the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application • the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, and • the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. F 47 ----- #### • **£’000** Operating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018 522,096 Subtract: Rent prepayments at 31 December 2018 that relate to 2018 lease payments (5,498) 516,598 Discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate of at the date of initial application 295,887 Add: finance lease liabilities recognised as at 31 December 2018 3,534 #### 27 Change in accounting policies (continued) The associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been applied.

The Fitness World Group are a leading European low cost gym and fitness operator, and the combination gives PureGym significant scale in Continental Europe and rapidly accelerates the Group’s international expansion. Fitness World has more than 600,000 members, over 230 gyms and in 2018 earned revenues of £175m and EBITDA of £38m. The acquisition was funded through a €445 million senior secured bridge facility agreement with a variable interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, in addition to upsizing the RCF by £35 million taking the total RCF facility to £95 million. It is the Group’s intention to refinance the bridge facility during 2020, however should it remain in place on 13 January 2021 then the bridge facility agreement provides for automatic conversion to a term loan, repayable in February 2025. As at the date of issue of these financial statements, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete. As such, the disclosures required under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combination’ cannot be made with regards to this transaction, as permitted under paragraph B64 of IFRS 3. F 49 ----- #### 29 Business combinations During the year, the Group made trade and asset acquisitions of existing gym businesses. The gyms were acquired for the purpose of expanding the PureGym property portfolio and increasing the Group’s presence in the relevant local markets. All gyms acquired were closed for refurbishment following acquisition to be reopened under the PureGym model and branding.

In considering its assessment of going concern the group has carried out extensive financial modelling, taking into account the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cashflows and liquidity of the group over the next 12 month period. This has included; the unwind of deferred payments, significantly reduced revenue during any further COVID-19 closure periods (including both localised closures and a further total group lockdown), mitigation measures announced by our governments (including the potential reduction of certain mitigation measures in future), measures put in place by the group to preserve cash and to reduce discretionary expenditure (including capex) and potential reductions in revenues resulting from changes in the behaviours of members upon reopening of our gyms. Having completed this thorough analysis, the directors are confident that the business will continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date. In September 2020, the group’s ultimate shareholders, Leonard Green & Partners, invested a further £100 million into the group’s ultimate parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited, which has been loaned to the group via an intercompany loan repayable on 30 November 2027. In addition, on 18 September 2020, the terms of the group’s revolving credit facility were amended to increase the size of the facility from £95 million to £145 million and waive the existing leveragebased covenant until 30 September 2022, which is replaced with a minimum liquidity requirement of £30 million. As a result, the group has sufficient liquidity to ensure full compliance with its financial covenants and to manage further plausible downside scenarios, including any new or extended local or national lockdowns. As at the date of this report, following repayment of the outstanding £37 million draw down on the revolving credit facility in October 2020, the group’s cash balance is £121 million, and the group has £266 million of total liquidity including £145 million available through the revolving credit facility.

Consequently, it is not necessary to segregate operating segments by service or product. The group’s material reportable segments are United Kingdom and Denmark. The results from operations in all other countries in which the group operates are included in “All other segments”.

The majority of members join in January, February and March, and joiner rates also increase in September and October. Seasonality is generally positively driven by consumers' desire to improve their fitness at the start of the year and the start of new university and school terms, and is negatively driven by Christmas and summer holidays. Marketing expenditure is generally focused around peak joining periods, particularly the January/February period. During the 6 months ended 30 June 2020, the group was forced to close its gyms across the entire estate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This caused a significant reduction in revenue during the closure period. All gyms in the estate initially closed between 12 and 21 March 2020. Gyms in Switzerland reopened on 11 May 2020, in Poland on 6 June 2020, and in Denmark on 11 June 2020. Subsequent to the period end, most gyms in UK have also reopened. The majority of member income and other income is recognised over time to reflect the period over which the customer receives the services provided.

During the period ended 30 June 2020, the group’s full estate of gyms were forced to temporarily close as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has significantly reduced the forecast cash flows which were used to perform the impairment review for the 2019 Annual Report. As such, an interim impairment review was performed over the group’s intangible assets as at 31 March 2020. Goodwill was reviewed for impairment with reference to the group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. The recoverable amount of a CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations used cash flow projections based on financial budgets reviewed by management covering a four-year period. There is sufficient headroom such that any reasonable sensitivity performed does not reduce the recoverable amount to lower than carrying value.

Bank loans and overdrafts The group has £430 million of Senior Secured Notes in issue as at the period end (“the Notes”). The Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange, for which Pinnacle Bidco plc is the Issuer and certain subsidiaries of the group are guarantors. Interest accrues at a rate of 6.375%, payable half yearly in February and August and the Notes are due to be repaid in full on 15 February 2025. On 14 January 2020, the group acquired Fitness World for a consideration of DKK 2,037,110,000 (£233 million) and the acquisition was funded through a €445 million (£381 million) Senior Secured bridge facility. In general, the key terms of this debt and maximum interest rate are consistent with the group’s existing sterling notes. It is the group’s intention to refinance this facility during 2020, however should it remain in place on 14 January 2021 then the bridge facility agreement provides for automatic conversion to a term loan, repayable in February 2025. In addition, as at 30 June 2020, the group has a £95 million revolving credit facility with eight international institutions (Barclays Bank PLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse International, ING Bank N.V. Lloyds Bank plc and Danske Bank A/S, collectively ""the Lenders""), of which £10 million is designated as an overdraft facility. The revolving credit facility is repayable on 30 November 2024, secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of Pinnacle Bidco PLC and certain of its subsidiaries and subject to a financial covenant of net leverage ratio lower than or equal to 7.7 when amounts drawn down on the facility are greater than 40%. On 17 March 2020, the group drew down £85 million on the facility in order to provide readily available liquidity, if required as a result of the COVID-19 gym closures. £48 million was repaid on 23 June 2020 such that the amount drawn down at the balance sheet date was £37 million. The group has been in compliance with all covenants during the current and previous financial period. Capitalised issue costs are amortised over the period to the repayment dates of the notes and loan. Short term financing represents amounts owed to financing institutions in relation to supply chain financing arrangements. All amounts are due for repayment in less than one year.

This note presents information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s risk management framework.  Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The key market risks affecting the group are interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain borrowings and deposits. Financial instruments affected by exchange rate risk include the senior secured bridge facility. At 30 June 2020, the €445 million senior secured bridge facility had a carrying amount of £406,219,000 based on an exchange rate of 0.913. A 5% increase in the rate at 31 December 2020 would increase the carrying amount of the facility to £426,529,000 and cause an increase of £20,311,000 in loss for the period.  Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. During the period, the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates related primarily to the group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates. F 175 ----- ## Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Information (continued) #### 11   Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued) As at 30 June 2020, the group had the majority of its borrowing in fixed rate instruments by way of senior secured loan notes, a senior secured bridge facility, amounts owed to group undertakings, and lease liabilities. The group has drawn down £37m of the £95m revolving credit facility which has floating interest rates. As such, the group has exposure to movements in the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and the group’s leverage ratio. As at 31 December 2019 the group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves.

F 180 ----- ## Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Information (continued) #### 16 Subsequent events _During the 6 month period ended 30 June 2020, all of the group’s gyms were temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gyms in Denmark, Switzerland and Poland all reopened during the same period. Subsequent to the end of the period, most of the group’s remaining closed gyms reopened with a range of reopening dates: Northern Ireland (10 July), England (25 July),Wales (10 August), and Scotland (31 August). Following a re-emerging outbreak of COVID-19, all 236 gyms in England were re-closed on 5 November 2020, and these remain closed as at the date of this report. On 24 August 2020 Fitness World group implemented plans to optimise its profitability. The programme aims to optimise the Danish estate and operating model following the acquisition by PureGym in January 2020. It includes the closure of six Urban Gym clubs, and two low-profit Fitness World clubs as well as converting four Urban Gym clubs to Fitness World clubs. In addition, Fitness World is implementing a more efficient operating structure, impacting 328 Fitness World employees. The new structure will improve the member experience through a more skilled and smaller group of managers and by centralising functions at the head office. On 17 September 2020, the Group increased the size of its Revolving Credit Facility by £50 million to £145 million. On 18 September 2020, the Group’s ultimate parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited issued an additional £100 million of preference shares to its majority shareholder, Leonard Green & Partners. On the same day, this amount was loaned to the Group by a subsidiary of Pinnacle Topco Limited, Pinnacle Midco 2 Limited, via an intercompany loan repayable on 30 November 2027. On 9 November 2020, a filing was made to place the Polish Fitness World business into insolvency. This followed a strategic decision by the Group to withdraw support from the Polish business. This is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event in respect of the 30 June 2020 interim financial information and the impact on the group's balance sheet is expected to be an increase in net liabilities of approximately £5 million._ F 181 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

F-183 ----- As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. - Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Previously, the Group classified property leases as operating leases under IAS 17. For these leases, lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments on transition to IFRS 16, discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019. F-209 ----- For contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate as at the commencement date. At the lease commencement date, the Group assesses whether extension or termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised. If there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within the Group's control, the Group reassesses whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Other revenue includes revenues related to the sale of day passes, nutritional products and personal training sessions. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied and services rendered, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. Employee expenses comprise wages and salaries, including holiday allowance and pensions as well as other expenses for social security, etc. The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. In addition, the Group has a few defined benefit plans where the responsibility for the pension obligation to the employees lies with the Group. The Group’s net obligation is calculated annually by an actuary. The present value less fair value of any plan assets is recognised as pensions in the statement of financial position. **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** Wages and salaries 394,202 324,375 Pensions, defined contribution plans 12,272 9,104 Pensions, defined benefit plans 1,651 397 Other expenses for social security 17,848 6,108 _ _ **425,973** **339,984** _ _ Average number of full-time employees* 1,379 1,286 _ _ See also note 10 Intangible assets, note 12 Property, plant and equipment and note 13 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** Amortisation of intangible assets 131,571 92,445 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 101,654 127,891 Depreciation of right-of-use assets 368,842 _______________________ **602,067** **220,336** _ _ #### 5 Special items Special items include significant non-recurring income and expenses that Management does not consider to be part of the Group’s ordinary operations such as fundamental structural costs and other costs related to organisational changes.

The tax attributable to the profit for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. The tax expense relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to calculate the amount are those that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries in which the Group operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** Current income tax: Current income tax charge -23,234 -17,636 Prior-year adjustment to income tax charges 7,895 -756 Deferred tax: Changes in temporary differences 19,435 1,835 _  _ Deferred tax is calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: - when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised, except: - when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities, and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances arises. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed the goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period and relates to new information about facts and circumstances at the acquisition date, or recognised in the income statement. F-198 ----- Intangible assets comprise goodwill, customer base, trademarks and software. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test, initially before the end of the acquisition year. The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment together with the other non-current assets of the cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated. The assets of the CGUs are written down to the recoverable amount in the income statement if the carrying amount is higher. The recoverable amount of a CGU is generally determined as the present value of the expected future net cash flows from the entity or activity (CGU) to which the goodwill relates. Except for goodwill, all other intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortised according to the Group's accounting policies. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Goodwill acquired through business combinations with indefinite lives has been allocated to three CGUs, which are tested for impairment: - Denmark - Poland - Switzerland Other intangible assets comprising customer base, trademarks and software all relate to the activities in Denmark and Switzerland; see note 10 Intangible assets. Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Other fixtures and fittings and leasehold improvements are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is available for use. Subsequent costs, for example in connection with replacement of components of property, plant and equipment, are recognised in the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that the costs will result in future economic benefits for the Group. The replaced components are derecognised from the balance sheet, and the carrying amount is recognised in the income statement. All other expenses relating to ordinary repairs and maintenance are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Where individual components of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are depreciated separately. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets/components as follows: Other fixtures and fittings 3-10 years Leasehold improvements 8 years Depreciation is calculated on the basis of the residual value and impairment losses, if any. The depreciation period and the residual value are determined at the acquisition date and are reassessed annually. If the residual value exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation is discontinued. Depreciation charges are recognised in the income statement as amortisation and depreciation. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other operating income in the consolidated income statement.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 to lease contracts related to fitness clubs, offices, cars and other equipment. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases of lowvalue assets and short-term leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At inception of a contract entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, i.e. the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone prices. The Group has a large number of individual leases, primarily related to leasing of fitness club premises and offices. The lease terms vary between markets from a few years to rolling without a defined end date. Several of the lease contracts include extension and termination options. Most of the lease contracts include mechanisms for rent adjustments either as a fixed-percentage increase, as an adjustment based on local price indices or as market rent reviews. Goods for resale are measured at cost in accordance with the first-in, first-out method. Where the net realisable value is lower than cost, inventories are written down to this lower value. Goods for resale are measured at cost, comprising purchase price plus delivery costs. Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost or net realisable value, equivalent to nominal value less allowances for doubtful trade receivables, whichever is lower. The Group applies the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses, which uses lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables at each reporting date. The provision for expected credit losses is based on days past due for groups of customers with similar credit risk characteristics as well as an individual assessment. **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** 58,616 55,832 Trade receivables _ _ Current trade receivables 58,616 52,817 Non-current trade receivables  - 3,015 Write-downs included in trade receivables developed as follows: Write-downs at 1 January 10,575 4,700 Write downs from business combinations  - 3,166 Write-downs during the year 8,205 7,409 Write-downs realised -9,554 -4,700 _ _ **9,226** **10,575** _ _ Cash and cash equivalents include cash and deposits less bank overdrafts. **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** Cash excluding bank overdrafts 29,570 45,060 _ _ Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.

At 31 December 2019, the Group's undrawn, committed borrowing facilities totalled DKK 40 million (2018: DKK 100 million). #### 17 Provisions Provisions are recognised when, as a consequence of a past event, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and it is probable that there will be an outflow of the Group’s financial resources to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at Management’s best estimate of the costs required to settle the obligation. Discounting is applied where relevant. Restoration costs are recognised as liabilities when a legally binding lease contract obligation exists. Provision for legal disputes is recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is possible that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, the Group arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities on initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, subsequently at amortised cost. This includes directly attributable transaction and borrowing costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. Trade and other payables, bank overdrafts, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. F-217 ----- The Group recognises its financial assets at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria are met: - The asset is held within a business model the objective of which is to collect the contractual cash flows. - The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. F-218 ----- The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. Management identifies and evaluates the financial risks based on principles for overall risk management. The Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Management is of the opinion that the Group’s exposure to financial risks is limited. The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has loans, trade and other receivables and cash that derive directly from its operations. The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. It is the Group’s policy not to trade in derivatives for speculative purposes. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. To achieve this overall objective, the Group's capital management aims, for example, to ensure that it meets financial covenants connected to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Failure to meet the financial covenants would permit the bank to call in loans and borrowings. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. Net debt includes interestbearing loans and borrowings, finance lease liabilities, and trade and other payables, less cash. The net debt at 31 December was as follows: **DKK’000** **2019** **2018** Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1,036,266 1,071,368 Finance lease / lease liabilities 2,093,139 99,088 Less cash -29,570 -45,060 _ _ Lease liabilities that predate implementation of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019 are classified as finance lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities. A finance lease is classified as a lease that, in all material respects, transfers the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. The accounting treatment of assets held under finance leases and lease liabilities is described under property, plant and equipment and financial liabilities respectively. Operating lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The financial statements include the financial statements of the Group and the subsidiaries in the following table: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The costs of an acquisition are measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at fair value at the acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in special items. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in the acquire’s host contracts. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or as a financial liability. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. All contingent considerations (unless classified as equity) are measured at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed, and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree have been assigned to those units. Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the divested operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the divested operation and the portion of the CGU retained. Where settlement of any part of the cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the transaction date. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Following initial recognition, software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised, and expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Software development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets if the following criteria are met: - It is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use. - Management intends to complete the software and use or sell it. - There is an ability to use or sell the software. - It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits. - Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the software. - The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software include employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. F-201 ----- Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. The Group has assessed the remaining useful life to be finite for all recognised other intangible assets. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets. Software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed five years. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (CGUs).

No basis for impairment was found for 2019 for Denmark and Switzerland (2018: DKK 0). The impairment tests compare the carrying amount of the assets with the discounted value of future cash flows.

The value in use is established using certain key assumptions as described below. These are revenue growth, EBITDA and discount rates. Value-in-use cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by Management covering the subsequent financial year. The assumptions applied in the short to medium term are based on Management's expectations regarding the operational development and growth in product contribution. The terminal growth rates applied for the period beyond the projections do not exceed an expected weighted long-term average growth rate, including inflation, for the countries in which the Group operates. Management has used a budget period of eight years, as it expects continuing growth in Denmark and Switzerland followed by a stable period after eight years. Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks for the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the Group's specific circumstances and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investments by investors. F-204 ----- The specific discount rates, which are calculated net of tax, are generally based on 10-year Danish government bonds. The cost of debt is based on the yield to maturity on 10-year Danish government bonds plus a credit risk premium measured by the spread between the yield to maturity of 10-year EUR-denominated corporate bonds issued by comparable companies and the yield to maturity of 10year EUR-denominated German government bonds. A capital structure with a ratio of 90% between the market value of debt and equity value has been applied in the calculation based on the capital structure of comparable companies. A long-term market equity risk premium of 7.6% has been applied to reflect an expected long-term stock market return of 8%. In addition, the Group was acquired by Pinnacle Europe Holdings Limited (“PureGym”) as of 14 January 2020, which did not show any impairment. Uncertainties reflecting historical performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the future cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

This requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the relevant CGU. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-generating units (CGUs). Impairment testing is an area involving Management judgement and requires assessment as to whether the carrying amount of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets, using cash flow projections that have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions need to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

Estimated useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets are based on Management's judgement and experience. If Management identifies that the actual useful life differs materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation and amortisation, the charge is adjusted prospectively. Due to the significance of capital investment, variations between actual and estimated useful lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively. The useful life used to amortise intangible assets relates to the expected future performance of the assets acquired and Management's judgement as to the period over which economic benefits will be derived from the asset.

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition and at each reporting date. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised directly in the income statement, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in future cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment. Cash flow hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement as financial expenses. The Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in the income statement as financial expenses. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction impacts the income statement, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the same item as the hedged item when the hedged item impacts the income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described below, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: - Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities - Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable - Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable F-219 ----- For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of other financial instruments: Floating-rate borrowings are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates and Forward Topco A/S' creditworthiness. The fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The own non-performance risk at 31 December 2019 was assessed to be insignificant. The various counterparties for derivative financial instruments are principally financial institutions with investment-grade credit ratings. The applied valuation techniques are discounted cash flow models, which incorporate various inputs, including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and interest rate curves. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value. Fair values of the Group's interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined according to the discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that reflects the issuer's borrowing rate at the end of the reporting period.

The credit quality of customers is assessed based on analysis, and individual credit limits are set for each customer. The Group’s policy is that all members must pay the membership subscription upfront, and the credit risk on membership subscriptions is therefore limited to those fees that could not be collected upfront. The first measure to limit credit risk is that access to the services provided by the Group is no longer granted to customers with overdue subscriptions until the receivables have been paid in full. The Group does not hold collateral as security for the membership receivables. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions. The Group’s prepayment policy means that any account receivables related to membership subscriptions are automatically past due.

The implementation of IFRS 16 has resulted in a change in the presentation of the main part of operational leasing contracts, which from 2019 are recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with related lease liabilities. The Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (“short term leases”), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (“low-value assets”). Impact of IFRS 16 As part of implementing IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, the Group has recognised right-of-use assets of DKK 1,898 million (excluding new classification of restoration assets and previous finance lease liabilities under IAS 17) and lease liabilities of DKK 1,898 million.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the income statement under finance expenses. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement on a net basis under other operating income/(expenses). Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss, and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equities held at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or entitlement, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption, and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights in an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the investee’s other vote holders - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.

Determining the carrying amounts of some assets and liabilities requires estimates and assumptions concerning future events. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that Management assesses to be reasonable, but that by their nature involve uncertainty and unpredictability. These assumptions may have to be revised, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur. The Group is subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to actual results differing from these estimates, both positively and negatively. Specific risks for the Group are discussed in the relevant sections of the Management’s review and in the notes. The areas that involve a high degree of judgement and estimation and are material to the financial statements are described in more detail in the related notes. - Valuation of intangible assets; see note 10 - Useful life of assets; see note 12 - Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; see note 13 - Impairment test; see note 11 - Trade receivables; see note 15 - Provisions; see note 17 F-245 ----- #### Statement by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Forward TopCo A/S at 31 December 2017 and the Financial year 2017 The Consolidated Financial Statements of Forward TopCo A/S (together with its subsidiaries the “Group”) at 31 December 2017 and for the financial year 2017 included in the Offering Memorandum have been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2017 contained in the annual reports as prepared and approved by the Executive Board and Board of Directors (the “Management”) on 26 February 2018.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company at 31 December 2017 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January – 31 December 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the ""Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements"" (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""the financial statements"") section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence F-248 ----- #### We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these rules and requirements. Statement on the Management's review Management is responsible for the Management's review. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act. Based on our procedures, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the Management's review. Management's responsibilities for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report F-249 ----- #### that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The value in use is established using certain key assumptions as described below. These are revenue growth, EBITDA and discount rates. Value-in-use cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by Management covering the subsequent financial year. The assumptions applied in the short to medium term are based on Management's expectations regarding the operational development and growth in product contribution. The terminal growth rates applied for the period beyond the projections do not exceed an expected weighted long-term average growth rate, including inflation, for the countries in which the Group operates. Management has used a budget period of 8 years, as it expects continuing growth in Denmark followed by a stable period after 8 years. Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks, taking into consideration the time value of money and individual risks for the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the Group's specific circumstances and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investments by investors. The specific discount rates, which are calculated net of tax, are generally based on a 10-year Danish government bond. The cost of debt is based on the yield to maturity on 10-year Danish government bonds plus a credit risk premium measured by the spread between the yield to maturity of 10-year EUR-denominated corporate bonds issued by comparable companies and the yield to maturity of 10-year EUR-denominated German government bonds. A capital structure with a ratio of 70% between the market value of debt and equity value has been applied in the calculation based on the capital structure of comparable companies. A long-term market equity risk premium of 7.6% has been applied to reflect an expected long-term stock market return of 8%. Uncertainties reflecting historical performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the future cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.

The first measure to limit credit risk is that access to the services provided by the Group is no longer granted to customers with overdue receivables until the receivables have been fully paid. The Group does not hold collateral as security for the membership receivables. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions.

The impact of the new standard changes the classification, measurement and impairment of financial assets, furthermore the standard introduces new rules for hedge accounting. During 2017, the Group has performed a detailed impact assessment of IFRS 9. Based on the current portfolio of financial assets and liabilities there will be no significant changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets, by implementing the new IFRS 9 standard. The current portfolio consists of loans and trade receivables held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal. As such, it is concluded that these meet the criteria for amortised cost measurement under IFRS 9. Therefore, reclassification of these are not required. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, either on a 12month or lifetime basis. The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables. Based on the historically low realised loss on loans and trade receivables in the range of DKK 0 - 5 million, the new approach will not have a significant impact on The Groups consolidated financial statements. The Group has determined that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated as effective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. While IFRS 9 changes the accounting treatment for cost of hedging, hedge of risk components etc., The Group does not currently have any hedging relationships which will be impacted by the changes to the hedge accounting requirements. As IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity accounts for effective hedges, applying the hedging requirements of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact on The Group’s consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 15 will be implemented in the consolidated financial statements for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2018.

The new IFRS 16 standard will result in almost all leases being recognised in the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, a lease asset (the ‘right-of-use’ asset) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. There are only few exceptions which are related to short-term and low-value leases. As lessee, the Group will be required to separately recognise interest expenses on the finance lease liability and depreciation expenses on the right-of-use asset. Further, the Group will also be required to account for lease modifications such as changes to the lease term as well as changes in the future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments. The amount of the re-measurement will be recognised as an adjustment to the lease liability and right-of-use asset. As a result of the new standard, EBITDA as the primary performance measure in the Group will be impacted by the reclassification of expensed rent to depreciation and interest expenses. Cash flow from operating activities will be impacted positively as the classification of the lease payments related to rent premises changes from operating cash flow to cash flow from financing activities. Aside from EBITDA, IFRS 16 will also impact the balance sheet and balance sheet-related ratios such as net interest-bearing debt due to the recognition of the lease asset and finance liability. At the reporting date, the Group had non-cancellable operating lease commitments of DKK 1,242 million. During 2017, the Group performed a preliminary assessment and it is expected that most of the current leases will qualify as leases to be recognised in the balance sheet under IFRS 16 and only insignificant commitments may be covered by exceptions. Based on the preliminary assessment, The Group expects a positive impact on the EBITDA margin between 20-25%. In 2018, The group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements, including the impact from the change in the definition of the lease term, extension and termination options. As a result, no reliable amounts have been calculated which are expected to have any quantitative effect on the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows. The Group intends to adopt the standard on 1 January 2019 applying the simplified transition approach without restating comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised, except: - when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances arises.

All of ours gyms were closed since the governments in the countries of operations imposed a total lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19. In June, all of our facilities around countries of operations was reopened and our member base was back at approx. 95% of last year’s level. The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements, capex and funding of new gyms through its cash reserves. In considering its assessment of continued operations, the group has carried out extensive financial modelling, taking into account the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the cashflows and liquidity of the Group. This has included; significantly reduced revenue during the extended COVID-19 closure period, mitigation measures announced by our governments, measures put in place by the Group to preserve cash and to reduce discretionary expenditure and potential reductions in revenues resulting from changes in the behaviours of members after reopening. The currently known impact of COVID-19 on the group for the first six months in 2020 are: - A decline in revenues for the first 6 months of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 of 42% - The decline in revenue partly offset by compensation schemes received in the territories of approx. DKK 160m - A positive cash flow in the first half of 2020 of approx. DKK 100m due to mitigation actions and government support both directly through cash compensating of salary expenses and fixed cost, and deferments of various tax and VAT payments - The first full month after lockdown, July, shows revenue at same level as July 2019 To mitigate the consequences of COVID-19, the entity has taken the following actions: - Initiated several mitigation actions to preserve cash, hereunder extended supplier payments, postponed investments, cost reviews; - Obtained all compensation possible form the local governments in the countries of operation As a result of the actions and the fact that the Group activities almost have been back on a normal level immediately after reopening, the liquidity is strong and sufficient for the continued operations. Forecast for the remaining part of 2020 shows a negative cash flow from operations of approx. DKK 40m, which can be covered by current cash reserves. The forecast thereby shows a significant headroom in the liquidity reserve. The sensitivity analysis shows that the cash inflow from memberships are very firm due to termination periods and only significant reductions will impact the cash reserve. On cash outflow, the cost structures are very predictable and also show that only significant unexpected increases can exceed the cash reserve. The assessment from management is that the group can handle another 16-20 weeks of complete lockdown period before absorbing the cash reserve and therefore our modelling demonstrates that the group has sufficient liquidity to continue to operate without support.",N/A,as_expected,2020,665
