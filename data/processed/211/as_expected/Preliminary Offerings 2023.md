You are reminded that this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are

with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to,
deliver this Offering Memorandum to any other person. You may not transmit the attached Offering
Memorandum (or any copy of it or part thereof) or disclose, whether orally or in writing, any of its
content to any other person, except with the consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer
or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction
requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers (as defined
in this attached Offering Memorandum) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or
dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such
affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall this Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there by any sale
of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

This Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic
transmission and consequently neither the initial purchasers set forth in the attached Offering
Memorandum (collectively, the “Initial Purchasers”), Pinnacle Bidco plc or any of their subsidiaries
nor any person who controls them nor any director, officer, employee or agent of them or affiliate of
any such person accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between
the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available
to you on request from the Initial Purchasers. If you receive this document by e-mail, you should not
reply by e-mail to this announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generated
by using the “reply” function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this
document by e-mail, your use of this e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take
precautions to ensure that it is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

Restrictions: This Offering Memorandum is in preliminary form and is being furnished in connection
with an offering exempt from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Nothing in this electronic
transmission constitutes an offer of securities for sale in the United States or any other jurisdiction.
Recipients of the attached Offering Memorandum who intend to subscribe for or purchase securities are
reminded that any subscription or purchase may only be made on the basis of the information contained
in the final version of the preliminary offering memorandum, together with a pricing supplement, or the
final offering memorandum.

Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to or for the account or
benefit of U.S. persons (as such terms are defined in Regulation S) except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the expiration of a 40-day distribution compliance period (as
defined under Regulation S under the Securities Act) commencing on the issue date, the securities may
not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to another exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the EEA. For the purposes
of this paragraph, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (b) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a “professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c)
not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
**Regulation”).**

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparty only target**
**market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market**
assessment in the EEA in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is professional clients and eligible counterparties,
each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this
paragraph, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”); (b) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (c) not a qualified
investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”), and the expression an offer includes the communication in any
form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered
so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.


-----

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

**U.K. product governance / professional client and eligible counterparty only target market:** Solely
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the
United Kingdom in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook of Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The attached Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of FSMA
by an authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the attached Offering Memorandum and
any other material in relation to the Notes described therein are being distributed only to, and are
directed only at, persons who are not “retail investors” (as defined above) and who are (i) persons having
professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), and
persons falling within Article 49 of the Order, or (ii) persons to whom it would otherwise be lawful to
distribute them, all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” The Notes are only
available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such
Notes will be engaged in only with, Relevant Persons. The attached Offering Memorandum and its
contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or
disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United Kingdom who is not a Relevant Person.
Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the attached
Offering Memorandum or its contents.

**Preliminary Offering Memorandum** **Strictly Confidential**

**Not for general distribution in the United States**

#### Pinnacle Bidco plc

###### £805,000,000 (equivalent)


**€** **% Senior Secured Notes due 2028**

**£** **% Senior Secured Notes due 2028**

Pinnacle Bidco plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”)
€ aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and £ aggregate
principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Sterling Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The
Euro Notes will bear interest at a rate of % and will mature on, 2028. The Sterling Notes will bear interest at a rate of
% and will mature on, 2028. The Issuer will pay interest on the Euro Notes semi-annually in arrears on
each and, commencing on, 2024 and will pay interest on the Sterling Notes semi-annually in arrears on
each and, commencing on, 2024. The proceeds of the Notes will, along with cash on balance sheet, primarily
be used to repay existing indebtedness. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after, 2025, at the redemption prices specified herein. Prior
to, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus
a “make-whole” premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date. Prior to, 2025,
the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes with the net proceeds from certain
equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum (“Offering Memorandum”). Prior to, 2025, the Issuer
may, during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date (as defined herein), redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of each
of the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of such Euro Notes or Sterling Notes, as applicable,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date. The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of each of the
Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a
“change of control,” the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred if the Issuer’s consolidated net leverage is less than a specified level. See “Description of the Notes.”

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not
subordinated in right of payment of the Notes, including the Issuer’s obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). On or
about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Guarantees,” and each of them, a “Guarantee”) by certain of Issuer’s
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors,” and each of them, a “Guarantor”), each of which will provide a senior guarantee in respect of the New
Revolving Credit Facility. The Guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to such Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

Each series of Notes and Guarantees will be secured by the collateral described under “Description of the Notes—Security” (“Collateral”). The New
Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Notes will also be secured by first-priority security interests over the Collateral. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the security interests, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the
Collateral only after the New Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.” The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors will be subject to the_
limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of
and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. There are no assurances that the Notes will be listed on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange or that such listing will be maintained. The Official List of The International Stock Exchange is
not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments.

The Euro Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000. The Sterling Notes will be
issued in registered form in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000.

Each of the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes will be represented by one or more global notes, which we expect will be delivered through Euroclear
SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), on or about, 2023 (the “Issue Date”). See “Book-Entry, Delivery
**and Form.”**


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 33.**

**Issue Price for the Euro Notes:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date**

**Issue Price for the Sterling Notes:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date**

**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities**
**Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United States or to,**

condition or results of operations. We cannot guarantee that the application we will make to The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the Notes to be listed and admitted to trading on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange thereof will be approved as of the Issue Date for
the Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this
admission to trading.

The Issuer expects that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the
date specified in the last paragraph on the front cover of this Offering Memorandum, which will
be (on a U.S. T+ convention) or (on a UK/EU T+ convention)
business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)) following the date of this Offering Memorandum. Under
rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or on one of the next two
succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle
T+ U.S. / T+ U.K., to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
pricing or on one of the next succeeding two business days should consult their advisors.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN OTHER INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors:** The Notes are not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available
to any retail investor in a member state in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning
of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not
a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
**Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014**
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering, selling
or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparty only target**
**market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market**
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these
purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“U.K. Prospectus Regulation”), and the expression an offer includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as
to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K.
PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the U.K. will
be made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a

U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

**U.K. product governance / professional client and eligible counterparty only target market:** Solely
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the
United Kingdom in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties as defined in the
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial Data**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated on October 30, 2017 for the purpose of
consummating the 2017 Acquisition (as defined below) and the related financing thereof. This Offering
Memorandum does not include standalone financial statements of the Issuer. The Issuer conducts no
business operations of its own and as of the Issue Date its only material assets will be its holding of the
entire issued share capital of its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”), as well as rights
and claims under intercompany financings. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions
and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the Issuer’s only material liabilities will be its outstanding
indebtedness under the Notes and certain subordinated shareholder debt. For further information, please
see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure,” “Business” and “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements.”_

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006, including the related notes thereto (the “2022 Financial
**Statements”) and includes certain unaudited restated financial statement line items as of and for**
the year ended December 31, 2021 and as of December 31, 2020;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021, which have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006, including the related notes thereto (the “2021 Financial
**Statements”). Certain financial statement line items in the consolidated statement of**
comprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position from the 2021 Financial
Statements were subsequently restated and unaudited in the 2022 Financial Statements, for more
information see Note 30 of the 2022 Financial Statements;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 (together with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, “IFRS”), including the related notes
thereto (the “2020 Financial Statements” and, together with the 2022 Financial Statements and
the 2021 Financial Statements, the “Audited Financial Statements”). Certain financial statement
line items in the consolidated statement of financial position from the 2020 Financial Statements
were subsequently restated in the 2022 Financial Statements, and the consolidated cash flow
statement from the 2020 Financial Statements was subsequently restated in the 2021 Financial
Statements, for more information see Note 30 of the 2022 Financial Statements and Note 1 of the
consolidated cash flow statement of the 2021 Financial Statements, respectively; and

- the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group as of and for the
six months ended June 30, 2023 (prepared in accordance with UK adopted IAS 34 _Interim_
_Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IAS 34”)) with_
unaudited comparative information for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the notes thereto
(the “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements” and, together with
the Audited Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”). Certain financial statement line
items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and

i


-----

for the six months ended June 30, 2022 were subsequently restated in the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. For more information see Note 15 of the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

In our 2022 Financial Statements, we restated certain unaudited comparative amounts in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position, and
in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, we restated certain unaudited
comparative amounts in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, each to reflect the
correction of a computational error in the way in which revenue was being calculated in our Swiss
operating segment, which impacted the Group’s prior financial years, including 2021 and 2020 and the
six months ended June 30, 2022. The error was confined to the Swiss operating segment and resulted
from the use of legacy systems for the calculation of revenue, which had only been used by the Swiss
operating segment and had been in place since before the Fitness World Acquisition. The error resulted
in an overstatement of revenue of £5.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, and a
corresponding overstatement of prepayments and trade receivables (presented in the balance sheet
within trade and other receivables) and understatement of contract liabilities – membership income
(presented in the balance sheet under trade and other payables). The error also resulted in an
overstatement of VAT payable (presented in the balance sheet under trade and other payables) in line
with the overstatement of revenue.

As a result, certain amounts in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the
year ended December 31, 2021 and consolidated statement of financial position for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived
from the unaudited comparative amounts presented in the 2022 Financial Statements. For more
information see Note 30 of the 2022 Financial Statements and Note 15 of the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

Furthermore, in our 2021 Financial Statements, we restated certain unaudited comparative amounts in
the consolidated cash flow statement to reflect the correction of a misstatement of the drawdown and
repayment amounts of the Existing Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility in the Group’s
2020 Financial Statements. The misstatement resulted in a £50,000,000 overstatement of repayment of
revolving credit facility in the year ended December 31, 2020 and a corresponding £50,000,000
overstatement of the drawdown on revolving credit facility for the same period. The error was confined
to these two line items, and the restatement did not impact the net drawdown. For more information see
Note 1 of the consolidated cash flow statement of the 2021 Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying
our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Notes to the
Financial Statements.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of
the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant
differences between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”), as applied to the Group. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and
U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Group’s IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such
information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment
decision. The Indenture will impose no obligation on us to reconcile our future financial statements
prepared under IFRS to U.S. GAAP.

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditor’s reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP state that the reports including the opinions were prepared for and only for the Group’s members

ii


-----

as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act of 2006 and for no other
purpose; the independent auditors did not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by their prior consent in writing.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditor has
confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes)
other than to the Group and its members as a body, with respect to the report and to the independent
auditor’s audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in
a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other
court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have
against the independent auditor based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it
relates could be limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—Investors in the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors.”_

**Non-IFRS Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted
EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA and certain other measures (the
“Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or the
accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We define the following Non-IFRS Measures as follows:

- “Adjusted EBITDA” as the profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net
finance cost, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets,
amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant
and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, exceptional administrative expenses, and other
adjustments, after adding back Pre-Opening Costs and share based payment charges and
subtracting the Cash Rent Adjustment.

- “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by revenue for that
period.

- “As adjusted Net Debt” represents total senior secured indebtedness of the Group less cash and
cash equivalents, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions and the application of the
proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions had occurred on December 31, 2022.

- “As adjusted Net Interest Expense” represents the net of interest payable/receivable for the 12
months ended December 31, 2022 after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions and the
application of the proceeds therefrom as if the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2022.

- “Average Continuous Membership Tenure” as the average monthly tenure of all active and
paying members, including members who have frozen their membership, as of a given point in
time. This includes previous memberships where the gap in membership was 30 days or less, but
excludes the period(s) of non-membership.

- “Average Gym ROCE” as Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant portfolio of gyms for that
period divided by the Initial Capital Investment attributable to that portfolio of gyms.

- “Average Initial Capital Investment for Mature Gyms” as the Initial Capital Investment for all
Mature Gyms for a certain period divided by the number of Mature Gyms in that period.

- “Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain
period divided by the number of Mature Gyms in that period.

- “Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a
certain period divided by the revenue attributable to Mature Gyms for that period.

iii


-----

- “Average Mature Gym ROCE” as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain portfolio of
gyms for a certain period divided by the Initial Capital Investment attributable to that portfolio of
gyms.

- “Average Revenue per Member per Month” as revenue for that period divided by the number
of months in that period and further divided by the average number of members during that period.
The average number of members during that period is calculated as the average of the number of
members at corporate gyms as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in
that period.

- “Cash Rent Adjustment” as the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which
otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA (as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). From 2021 onwards,
the Cash Rent Adjustment excludes the cash impact of COVID-19 rent deferments. Therefore,
Adjusted EBITDA more closely reflects the underlying trading results of the Group for the period.

- “EBITDA” as the profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost,
depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization
and impairment of intangible fixed assets, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment,
profit/loss on lease modifications and exceptional administrative expenses.

- “Expansionary Capital Expenditure” as the Initial Capital Investment and the capital costs of
expanding corporate-owned gyms incurred in that period, and the capital costs of investments in
technology in that period.

- “Gym cohorts” as groups of clubs that opened during a specified period.

- “Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA for that period, excluding Head Office
Costs.

- “Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for
that period.

- “Head Office Costs” as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization,
related to the operation of head office functions in a given period.

- “Initial Capital Investment” refers to the capital cost of bringing a new gym into operation or
extending a gym, including expenditures on site fit out, fixtures, fittings and equipment and
excluding the cost of any right of use property assets, ongoing maintenance and refurbishment
capex.

- “Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditures” as the total capital expenditure
incurred in a period less Expansionary Capital Expenditure incurred in that period.

- “Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA” as profit for a certain period before income tax expense, net
finance cost, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets,
amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant
and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications and exceptional administrative expenses for
mature sites, after adding back the Cash Rent Adjustment and Pre-Opening Costs for mature sites
and after adding back Head Office Costs.

- “Mature Gym EBITDA” as profit for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance
cost, depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets,
amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant
and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, exceptional administrative expenses and Head
Office Costs for Mature Gyms. Mature Gym EBITDA does not include the Cash Rent Adjustment

i


-----

or adjustments for Pre-Opening Costs or other extraordinary items that were added back to
Adjusted EBITDA and Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA.

- “Mature Gyms” as corporate-owned gyms that have been open for two full financial years or
more as at the reporting date.

Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditure cash flows for that period.

- “Operating Cash Flow Conversion” as the Operating Cash Flow for that period divided by
Adjusted EBITDA for that period.

expenses.

- “ROCE” is the return on capital employed, calculated as the Initial Capital Investment attributable
to that portfolio of gyms divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant portfolio of gyms for that
period.

- “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” as the Adjusted EBITDA including any Run-Rate Adjustment.

- “Run-Rate Adjustment” as the adjustment made to both corporate-owned and franchise gyms
which are less than three years old at the end of the reporting period. These adjustments replace
the Adjusted EBITDA earned by these sites in the last twelve month period with the projected
Adjusted EBITDA for their third year of operation.

- “Senior secured net debt” is the total senior secured indebtedness of the Group (excluding finance
lease liabilities as reported under IAS17), less cash & cash equivalents.

- “Total Capital Expenditure cash flow” as Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditure
cash flow and Expansionary Capital Expenditure cash flow incurred in the period.

- “Total debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities)” as total senior secured debt plus non-property
lease liabilities.

- “Working Capital Cash Flow” as cash movements in working capital.

We present a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measure
calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its limitations. For a reconciliation of
these Non-IFRS Measures and such discussions, refer to “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other financial, operational and pro forma data.”_

We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor’s understanding of
our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is
a measure commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly
titled measures used by other companies. Our EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not
measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to
other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived
in accordance with IFRS. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and
you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as
reported under IFRS. In addition, EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “Run**Rate Adjusted EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include:**


-----

- they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of
cash flows; and

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not
to be indicative of our ongoing operations.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to
evaluate our performance.

Key performance indicators and the other non-financial operational data included in this Offering
Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation
of these indicators may not be comparable with the use or computation of similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. None of the key performance indicators or other non-financial operating
data included in this Offering Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as an alternative to
any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS.

**_Other financial, operational and as adjusted data_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain other financial, operational and as adjusted data. This
information has been provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered indicative
of actual results that would have been achieved had the as adjusted for transactions been completed on
the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or
financial position. See “Summary—Summary Other Financial, Operational and As Adjusted Data.”
This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the
ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited.

**_Unaudited LTM Financial Information_**

The unaudited financial information included in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2023, is calculated by taking the unaudited results of operations of the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries for the six month period ended June 30, 2023 and adding it to the results of
operations for the full year ended December 31, 2022 and subtracting the results of operations for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2022, derived from the unaudited comparative information presented
in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. All such information is derived

judgments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and are subject to review, change and adjustment in
the course of preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and are not intended to be a
comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the periods presented. Although we
believe the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the assumptions

are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results as of and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for

**PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding the Group and the market
in which it operates and competes. Certain market data and certain economic and industry data used in
this Offering Memorandum was obtained from independent industry publications and reports prepared
by industry consultants and certain information was obtained from reports commissioned by and
prepared for us.

Industry publications and reports generally state that the information they contain has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. While the Issuer believes that each of these studies and publications is reliable, neither the
Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified such data and cannot guarantee their
accuracy or completeness. Any third-party information described above and included in this Offering
Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and, as far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain
from the information published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate, and no
facts have been omitted which would render such information inaccurate or misleading.

As noted in this Offering Memorandum, we have obtained market and industry data relating to our
business from providers of industry data, including:

- EuropeActive, a knowledge center for the European health and fitness sector, collaborates with
Deloitte to publish the European Health & Fitness Market Report (the “Deloitte/EuropeActive
**Report”). The report summarizes the latest marketing developments for the previous year,**
including rankings of the major European fitness club operators, views on market trends and
analyses of major national fitness markets in Europe. Where we make reference to the
Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, we refer to the 2023 Deloitte European Health & Fitness Market
Report. This source provides statistics on market growth and membership as well as major drivers
behind trends in the European health and fitness market.

- OC&C, an international strategy consulting firm, was commissioned by the Group to create a
Commercial & Strategic Review report for the Group (the “OC&C Report”). This source provides
information on the UK gym market, specifically, the competitive landscape, customer behavior
and ratings as well as the Group’s historic performance and growth opportunities.

In addition to the foregoing, certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market
position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to the Group contained in this Offering
Memorandum were estimated or derived based on assumptions we deem reasonable and from our own
research, surveys or studies conducted by third parties and other industry or general publications. While
we believe the Group’s internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by
any independent sources and neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their
accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. These estimates
have been derived from management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate,
as well as information obtained from public third-party industry reports and from our customers,
distributors, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we
operate. We also provide certain estimates of the growth of markets and certain other projections related
to our industry. This information is inherently speculative and subject to risk. Because such data is often
incomplete, multiple sources are typically triangulated to develop consensus estimates. Market data and
statistics, including information regarding penetration rates and growth, volume and growth and other
information about particular regions or markets, are inherently predictive and speculative and are not
necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are generally based on market
research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the
respondents. In addition, the value of comparisons of statistics of different markets is typically limited
by many factors, including that (i) the underlying information was gathered by different methods with
varying levels of access and information available in different markets and (ii) different assumptions
were applied in compiling the data. Market studies are frequently based on information and assumptions
that may not be exact and their methodology is by their nature forward-looking and speculative.

iii


-----

Furthermore, certain forward-looking statements contained in such industry and certain market data
may not fully include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions relating to the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, macroeconomic conditions or other related developments. There can be no
assurance that such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if such
developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, or
the current macroeconomic conditions had been taken into account. See “Forward-looking Statements.”
Further, please be aware that data and statistical information in this Offering Memorandum may differ
from estimates made by our competitors or from information found in current or future studies
conducted by market research institutes, consultancy firms or independent sources. While we are not
aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, our estimates
involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. See “Risk Factors,”
“Industry Overview” and “Business” for further discussion.

**Overview**

We are the second largest gym and fitness operator in Europe by number of gyms, with over 550 sites
and approximately 1.9 million members across our estate. We provide high quality, low cost, flexible
physical fitness facilities and have market leading positions in each of our three key markets: the UK,
Denmark and Switzerland.

Our operating model provides a powerful customer proposition that is differentiated from traditional
gym operators and appeals to a broad range of consumers. The key elements of our model proposition
include affordable membership fees, flexible contracts, a large footprint in each of our key markets and
24/7 access (in most locations) to high-quality gyms. This proposition is underpinned by the
differentiated, capital-efficient and technology-enabled gym operating model, which enables us to
support high levels of membership, operate on low costs and generate strong unit economics, cash flow
conversion and ROCE, and provides us with a strong platform for expansion.

Our strategic mission is to be a leading provider of affordable and flexible fitness memberships to
high-quality fitness facilities in current and new markets. Our customer value proposition, differentiated
business model and well-managed growth strategy has allowed us to grow rapidly in multiple
geographies through new site roll-outs, acquisitions and membership expansion. We are the largest
operator of gyms in the UK both by number of gyms and members. Following our acquisition of the
Fitness World Group in 2020, we also became the leading operator in Denmark by number of gyms and
members and the leading value gym operator in Switzerland by number of gyms and members. In 2021,
we launched a franchise model with the first franchised sites opening in the Middle East, which has
allowed us to bring our affordable, accessible gym proposition to a number of exciting new markets
and provides a platform for expanding our franchised offering to other territories in the future. In 2022,
we also opened our first three corporate-owned gyms in the U.S. with over 11,000 members as of
June 30, 2023.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenue of £515.3 million and a Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA of £128.4 million, an increase of 14% and 19%, respectively, from the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

**Key Strengths**

We believe that our key strengths are as follows:

**_Attractive and resilient fitness market driven by the winning value segment gym model_**

The European health and fitness club market had total revenues of €28 billion as of December 2022,
almost reaching the pre-COVID-19 revenues of €28.2 billion as of December 2019 (Source:
_Deloitte/EuropeActive Report), and similarly, fitness club membership volumes are recovering towards,_
and in some markets beyond, pre-COVID-19 levels. Memberships are showing consistent growth across
most European geographies, driven by structural trends towards greater consumer health awareness and
high importance, government support and promotion of fitness, as well as continued increase in gym
capacity. Over the four years from February 2015 to February 2019, gym membership in Europe was

1


-----

estimated to have increased from 54 million to 65 million, which reflects an estimated CAGR of 4.8%
(Source: OC&C Report). In 2022, European memberships increased by approximately 7 million
members, or 12% from 56 million in 2021 to 63 million (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report).

The value gym segment, in which we operate, has continued its long-term growth in both volume and
market share terms, as operators have expanded the market by providing affordable fitness options to
an underserved population. In all our key geographic markets, the value gym segment has continued to
gain share. In Europe, between 2015 and 2022, the share of net gym membership additions by 15 out
of the top 20 value operators was 91%. In all our core markets of the UK, Denmark and Switzerland
the value gym segment has also grown its share of memberships. For example, in the UK (the largest
market in Europe by revenue), between February 2015 and February 2023, value operators accounted
for 82% of net new member additions, meaning value share increased from 20% in 2016 to 28% in
2022, and again to 30% in 2023 (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report).

We believe the value fitness model will have greater overall success, compared to traditional fitness
models, due to its scalability and because it is economically superior to traditional gym center operating
models. The model generates significantly higher EBITDA due to lower costs (approximately £0.4
million EBITDA for a value gym as compared to approximately £0.3 million EBITDA for a mid-market
gym), lower capital expenditure to fit out each unit (£1.0 to £1.5 million for a value gym as compared
to £1.5 to £2.0 million for a mid-market gym). This delivers higher and more sustainable ROCE
(approximately 35% for a value gym as compared to approximately 18% for a mid-market gym)
(Source: Company information). For more information, see “—Operating model combines strong
_revenue management and low labor cost.”_

The gym market has demonstrated resilience during periods of both economic uncertainty and the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to the fitness
industry, causing gyms to close across all markets in Europe and inevitably membership numbers
declined significantly during these periods of disclosure. In spite of this, the market has recovered very
strongly and is now back to pre-pandemic levels. See “Industry Overview—Overview of the gym-based
_fitness market.” Many of the larger operators have emerged stronger following the pandemic, as gym_
operators required strong liquidity positions to be able to withstand the periods of extended closure
during local and nationwide lockdowns. Some weaker operators in both the value and mid-market gym
segments exited their respective markets, thereby increasing available space for expansion and creating
underserved demand. In addition, we believe that even if a weakened competitor did not exit the market,
it will, in general, struggle to maintain product quality because it will lack the resources to reinvest and
will struggle to raise new capital in the now more challenging market for financing.

The gym market has also traded strongly through previous economic downturns. This is well
demonstrated by data through the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, evidenced by an estimated
2.1% CAGR in total gym spend in the UK health and fitness club market between 2006 and 2012.
During this time period total gym spend did not fall during any individual year. From 2008 to 2012,
value gyms grew significantly, with membership increasing by an estimated CAGR of 121% (Source:
_OC&C Report)._

As the market figures show, gyms have continued to perform strongly through the recent economic
downturn. For example, in the UK memberships are estimated to have increased from 9.5 million in
February 2022 to 10 million in February 2023, representing an increase of over 5%. Consumer research
shows that consumers prioritize their gym memberships ahead of other areas of discretionary spend
such as eating out, holidays and clothing (Source: OC&C Report).

Against this backdrop, the value sector in the UK has performed particularly well, growing from
approximately 2.7 million memberships to 3.0 million memberships, from February 2022 to
February 2023, which is an increase of 10%. During this period, the value sector has benefitted from
members of premium, mid-market, and public sector gyms trading down, with a net inflow of 219,000
members between 2022 and 2023 alone (Source: OC&C Report).

Furthermore, we believe that the difficult macroeconomic environment seen in 2022 and the first half
of 2023 has provided further challenges for many businesses with pressure from energy costs, general
inflation, interest rates and consumers acting more cautiously. Because strong, well-capitalized players,
such as the Group, will be able to maintain product quality, our relative competitive position will, we
believe, improve over time. This is further evidenced by our cost of living indicators (such as website
traffic, web conversion rate, existing member upgrades, joiner ARPM (as defined below), member
discounting, bad debt recovery, financial concern cancellations and ancillary spend) which have
generally increased or remained consistent year over year in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.
Additionally, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our UK bad debt collection rate was consistent
with the rate for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Despite the impact of COVID-19, concomitant
governmental lockdowns and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we have managed the
business well, having retained our leading market positions, optimized our cost structure, opened 98
sites between January 2020 and June 30, 2023 and continued to increase total member numbers to
1,855,000 as of June 30, 2023. For more on our resilience, see “—Excellent performance management
_and continuous improvement.”_

**_Excellent core product offering delivered across a broad range of site sizes_**

Our core product offering includes the following features:

- _High-quality facilities and inclusive philosophy—we aim to “offer a boutique fitness experience at_
a value gym price.” Our gyms are equipped with a large number of pieces of high-specification
gym equipment, including a broad selection of cardio machines, fixed resistance machines, free
weights and functional and other exercise equipment, such as TRX bands and kettlebells. Our gyms
are clean, well-maintained and are fitted out with high-quality changing rooms and shower
facilities. We offer a welcoming environment and support all members in the pursuit of their fitness
goals, regardless of their current abilities. This is demonstrated, for example, by our “everybody
welcome” philosophy;

- _Superior convenience and proximity to customers as a result of well-developed club network—we_
have the largest and most extensive gym network in the UK and Denmark, with over 50% more
sites in the UK than our closest competitor. This allows us to capitalize on potential members’
desire for proximity. We believe this to be a competitive advantage, given that research indicates
that proximity is among the top two most important factors for members when choosing a gym. In
Denmark we enjoy an even larger market share position and both scale and network advantage
than in the UK when compared to other operators;

- _Group exercise classes—we have dedicated group exercise studios, including purpose-built_
stationary cycling studios in many locations. Most of our gyms offer a wide variety of over 50
classes per week, taught by fitness professionals. Other operators in the value market do not
typically offer such an extensive range of group exercise classes;

- _Membership and access options—we offer flexibility through our range of enrollment offers,_
extended opening hours, premium or off-peak membership options and online membership
management; and

- _Highly effective utilization of space—unlike many mid-market and premium operators, we do not_
install pools, spas, saunas, steam room, extensive cafes or other high-end amenities in our gyms.
These amenities are generally expensive to construct, operate and maintain and take up a
significant amount of leased space. We believe that these amenities are generally less utilized by
members and that by eliminating them we are able to install more pieces of high utilization fitness
equipment, such as treadmills, free weights and stationary bikes. As a result, our gyms can support
high levels of membership while operating on low operating and initial capital investment costs.

3


-----

Our core product offering is hard to replicate at scale, due to our strong presence and member loyalty
in our key markets, and underpins our market leading positions as the number one value gym operator
in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland and number two gym operator in Europe.

**_Great consumer value proposition_**

We have a compelling consumer value proposition. Key elements of this proposition include:

- _Flexible membership—members can sign up with flexible contracts. Accordingly, members have_
the freedom and the flexibility to leave at their convenience without incurring cancellation fees
and have the ability to freeze their memberships for months at a time;

- _Easy to join and online membership management—our online website and app platforms allow_
members to join in just two minutes, manage their memberships, freeze or cancel their
membership, book classes, locate gym facilities, track fitness data and engage in fitness challenges.
This ability to self-serve is convenient for members and lowers costs for the business;

- _Digital integration—we blend high-tech with high performance, including digital studios,_
interactive screens, a coherent online offer and content for workouts and exercise at home when
not in the gym, all of which are available via the PureGym app;

- _Affordable pricing—our flexible and low-cost membership structure provides excellent value for_
money for our members, with student discounts, day passes and off-peak membership options
available in many locations. These options further minimize costs for our members, often enabling
access to affordable fitness where there previously was none. Our variable pricing model, tailored
to the local market, is crucial to maximizing performance and allows us to tailor the offer to each
individual location;

- _Multi-gym access—members can buy an option to access any of our gyms in each country, many_
of which are open 24/7; and

- _Quality equipment and classes—we offer quality gyms, with members able to access_
approximately 50 face-to-face classes per week in many gyms, combined with nutrition, equipment
and personal training options.

Members receive all the above for a price significantly lower than in typical mid-market and premium
gyms. Our average monthly revenue per member was £24.55 as at June 30, 2023 and £24.61 for the six
months ended June 30, 2023, with mid-market and premium gyms typically charging significantly
more.

**_Operating model combines strong revenue management and low labor cost_**

We believe that the value fitness model is economically superior to traditional gym and fitness center
operating models through a combination of low fit-out capex, low equipment and maintenance spending
and high membership density. We believe that the resulting average return on invested capital, per site,
in value gyms is approximately double compared to a typical mid-market operators. As a result, those
operators who successfully deploy the value business model (such as the Group and our international
peers, Basic-Fit, SmartFit and Planet Fitness), benefit from attractive unit margins, rapid paybacks on
initial investment and high ROCE. Therefore, they are able to quickly redeploy capital to support further
network growth, further enhancing scale and associated economies. Our operating model benefits from
the following features:

- _Low personnel costs—we are able to operate our gyms with low levels of employed personnel_
primarily through the use of technology. For example, we offer an online and app-based enrollment
process, which eliminates the need for a dedicated in-gym sales forces, which are commonly used
by mid-market and premium operators. Members also use fully-automated PIN-controlled entry
portals, QR readers for apps, or member cards to facilitate secure access to our gyms, which largely

4


-----

eliminates the need for staff covering reception desks to control entry. We believe we can further
increase personnel cost efficiency, and thereby improve margins, by applying some best practices
from our operating model to our more recently acquired gyms in continental Europe through
measures such as unmanned hours covered by video surveillance with tailored alert systems;

- _Pricing sophistication—we have built sophisticated pricing capability, which gives us the ability_
to employ variable pricing in all gyms in order to tailor our price point to the specific local market.
This allows us to adapt to local markets by managing member enrollment, refine promotional
investment and thus optimize revenues;

- _Purchasing scale—we are one of only a small number of large, global, value fitness businesses._
This provides us with purchasing scale across our key geographies and results in lower costs. We
believe we are the largest purchaser of gym equipment in our key geographies from leading
suppliers including Matrix and Precor, thereby reducing the costs of constructing and operating
our gyms (such procurement costs for equipment costs can, we believe, be up to 30% to 40% lower
for large players and fit out costs can be up to 10% to 20% lower);

- _Ability to invest—our scale and resources allow us to rapidly develop new sites and invest in other_
areas of our business, such as technology, which enable us to operate more efficiently and deliver
a better customer experience. Our reinvestment and refurbishment capability further differentiates
us from smaller cash-constrained competitors;

- _Brand—we have an international brand that benefits from higher levels of brand awareness than_
other value gym operator in our key markets. The scale and both nationwide and international
footprints allow us to effectively pursue marketing campaigns such as social media and TV
advertisements. We invest digitally, nationally and locally to build brand awareness and
consideration. Our brand is also supplemented by our PureGym app, with many users and a wide
reaching, highly engaged social media following. For example, as at June 30, 2023, in the UK, the
brand benefits from a combined social media following of over 1.5 million users across all major
channels and both national and local gym accounts. In Denmark, despite the fact that the PureGym
brand was only launched in 2023, we have achieved online traffic shares of 50%-60% versus our
close competition (Source: _Company information); and_

- _Leading marketing expertise driving strong brand awareness—we have an increasingly_
sophisticated, multi-channel digital-led marketing strategy, which is not overly reliant on any
single channel. We employ a range of marketing techniques through various media channels in
order to promote a contemporary and differentiated brand, which would be difficult for new
entrants to replicate given our resources and prior marketing experience.

Our highly predictable new site performance and strong unit economics drive sustainable margins,
excellent cohort performance and cash flow generation. We believe that our performance metrics
demonstrate that we have developed a leading operating model in the value gym arena, with a revenue
CAGR of 30%, an Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of approximately 29%, a Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
CAGR of 23%, an operating free cash flow CAGR of approximately 23%, a number of gyms CAGR
of approximately 26% and a number of members CAGR of 22%, in each case over the 2014 to 2019
period (including the acquisition of Fitness World).

Furthermore, we believe that this strong track record is underscored by our recent results. Over the last
three fiscal quarters, we had an over 50% increase in Adjusted EBITDA as shown in the chart below.

5


-----

Our Adjusted EBITDA grew over 39%, revenue grew 17%, our membership grew 11%, our UK
membership grew 16% and our ARPM grew 4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, when compared to the month of December 2022,
our revenue increased over 57% in the month of June 2023, as illustrated in the chart below.

In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our average revenue per member per month was
£23.84, as compared to The Gym Group’s £17.82, which is the other main operator in the European
value market; our Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA per site was £412,000, as compared to the
Gym Group’s £270,000; our UK Mature Gym ROCE was 34% as compared to the Gym Group’s 20%.

**_Superior technology platform and digital capabilities_**

We operate an industry-leading technology platform and have invested heavily in building out our
digital presence, technology infrastructure and tech-based functionality over the last eight years. Our
cumulative technology investment to date is approximately £60 million and is approaching 300
person-years of time spent by software engineers on our technology platform. As a result, we have a
high and increasing degree of control over, and the ability to improve, our web, mobile and
application-based offerings, and operate a sophisticated, integrated back-end system. Our scale has
given us an advantage with respect to technology, and we believe that technological innovation and

6


-----

investment into the proprietary stack will help reduce costs and increase revenues over time. Key
features of our technology include:

- _Website and dedicated apps that, among other functions, provide members with the ability to enroll_
and upgrade into the various membership packages, utilize nutrition and exercise guides, view
workout videos and live and on-demand classes, find and book classes, see how busy their gym is,
track their gym activity, follow workout plans and track body composition metrics. The digital
front-end is used by us to proactively engage members, manage their experience and drive lifetime
value;

- _Digital content production and delivery capabilities allowing us to continuously expand our library_
of content for members;

- _On-site technology-enabled systems within individual gyms, including automatic PIN-based gym_
entry systems or access card gym entry and a growing number of self-serve/use-anytime digital
exercise studios across the estate; and

- _Software-based reporting and performance management systems providing advanced business_
insights and data analytics, which support decision-making across the business.

For more information on our technology platform and IT function, see “—Technology.”

**_Superior skills, rigor and sophistication in site selection and development_**

Given our established operating track record and position as a value gym industry leader in our key
markets, we have acquired significant expertise in property acquisition and management. We are skilled
at identifying site locations that will be successful and provide strong ROCE. For example, our Average
Mature Gym ROCE for the UK was 35% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, which was a 1%
increase as compared to same period in 2022. Furthermore, our UK Average Mature Gym ROCE for
Mature Gyms established between 2018 and 2020 was 36% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.
We believe that as our mature business continues to recover, our ROCE will continue to increase, as
illustrated in the graphic below.

In order to maintain our market-leading positions, we have strong site selection and property
development teams with industry expertise supported by an external team of professionals, such as
lawyers and planning consultants, as well as strong technological tools at our disposal. In particular, we
utilize a quantitative whitespace tool to identify attractive new locations in all geographies. The

7


-----

whitespace tool takes into account population statistics, drive times, local demographics, competitor
locations and infrastructure (for example, proximity to train stations) when analyzing potential new
sites, as well as incorporating learnings from our extensive roll-out history and subsequent performance.
The whitespace tool both identifies attractive markets as well as optimal locations for roll-out within a
catchment.

Our rigorous approach to site selection, which includes approval of all new sites by the Capex
Committee, the CEO and the CFO, is designed to ensure a high-quality property pipeline and estate
management across all geographies in which we operate. We have dedicated property acquisition teams
that are highly experienced in their relevant geography’s property market and have strong relationships
with landlords, developers, agents and other gym operators and retailers who may be looking to divest
sites. We have historically had a strong landlord covenant rating and have benefitted from “tenant of
choice” status given our scale, strong brand and high-quality product. As a result, we are generally able
to secure our selected sites on attractive lease terms throughout Europe.

With respect to site development, we have longstanding relationships with a pool of established
contractors as well as with other key third-party business partners such as structural engineers, planning
advisors and other building services providers. Our strong relationships and continuity with these
partners have enabled us to cost-effectively develop and open a large number of new gyms each year,
while simultaneously delivering a consistently high level of quality. For more information on our site
selection and development process, see “—Property.”

**_Excellent performance management and continuous improvement_**

Our senior management has an established track record of delivering growth and consistent operational
performance in their current roles at the company and in their prior roles at a range of other businesses.
Senior management is supported by an experienced management team in key areas, including property
acquisition, property development, operations, IT, marketing, legal, human resources, finance and
country level management. The senior management team is comprised of high caliber individuals with
strong educational backgrounds and broad experience from various sectors and previous businesses.
This ensures that our senior management and other important management teams are well invested and
are capable of executing both our focus on performance delivery and our growth strategy.

We have made substantial investments in management over recent years and important business
functions are now generally managed internally, which we believe provides us with a competitive
advantage. For example, important IT functions were brought in-house in recent years and the IT team
was strengthened with a number of new hires (including a new Chief Information Officer) to build and
maintain an industry-leading technology platform.

The outputs of a sustained program of active management have been very strong in terms of operational
and financial performance. In particular, our sophisticated pricing and revenue management approach
drives growth and is underpinned by four key principles: (1) optimal positioning towards the premium
end of the value segment, (2) using price to maximize site-opening volume and momentum, (3) setting
site-level prices based on the local market situation and (4) driving premiumization to enhance yield
from those willing to pay. New site pricing is actively managed to maximize volume growth in the near
term and secure yield and revenue in the medium to longer term, while variable headline pricing allows
specific tailoring to local markets and carefully controlled monthly core pricing changes as shown in
the graphics below (Source: Group information).

-----

This coherent revenue management process has delivered Average Revenue Per Member (“ARPM”)
(excluding VAT) growth since 2018, driven by like-for-like selling price increases and a higher likefor-like number of members joining or upgrading to a premium membership (on a three-month
average), with strong growth since early 2019. Moreover, under the current CEO, we grew from an
operator of 84 gyms with £37 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2014, to an operator of 566 corporate-owned gyms with £128 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. In the same time period, our members grew from 412,000
to 1,855,000 and revenue grew from £69 million to £515.3 million.

In addition to a strong track record of operational excellence and property acquisition expertise, our
leadership team also adheres to a balanced fiscal policy of deleveraging. Prior to COVID-19, we
reduced our senior secured net leverage from 4.6x in November 2017, to 4.0x in January 2018 and 3.6x
in December 2019. Since 2019 we have reduced our overall amount of senior secured net debt
(comprised of the Existing Notes and revolving credit facility drawings, if any, for the period minus
cash on balance sheet) to £614 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (comprised of £848
million of Existing Notes (with the Euro Notes translated at an LTM average exchange rate of €1.172
per £1.00), £204 million of cash on balance sheet (translated using respective LTM average exchange
rates and £30 million of cash held by our parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited)) from £810 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, with available liquidity of £356 million as of June 30, 2023
(includes cash on balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 of £180.3 million plus £31 million cash on balance
sheet held at our parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited).

Further, we have a clear deleveraging strategy for the future as we intend to:

- deploy capital in a considered and measured way to open new sites, improve existing sites and
deliver technology assets;

- reduce leverage by growing EBITDA through new site openings and the deployment of technology
assets in our core business and through capital-light franchising growth; and

- balance capital deployment with cash flow generation and progressive deleveraging.

We are targeting senior secured net leverage to operate between 3.6x to 4.6x by the end of 2024.

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to further expand our position as a market-leading value gym operator by providing
affordable, flexible and value-for-money memberships in high-quality gyms to anyone who wants to

9


-----

increase their level of fitness, while simultaneously delivering profitable growth. The key elements of
our strategy include:

**_Exploit structural growth opportunity in value gym sector_**

We plan to take advantage of both the opportunity to drive significantly increased penetration of gym
usage and the market shift from mid-market and premium gyms to value gyms. For more on how value
gyms are disrupting the market and taking market share, see “—Key Strengths—Attractive and resilient
_fitness market driven by the winning value segment gym model.” We plan to leverage our experience to_
continue the organic roll-out of new gyms with strong ROCE. Future growth in the value segment will
be driven by the development of new value gyms, continued market share gains from mid-market and
premium operators, as well as public gyms operated by local authorities, and overall growth in gym
participation rates due in part to the increasing awareness and availability of value gyms in each of our
markets. The significant opportunity for further growth in the value gym market is evidenced by:

- the significant success of the value gym concept to date and its broad consumer appeal;

- the current overall penetration rates of gym membership in existing markets; only 14.8% of the
British population as of February 2023, an estimated 16.8% of Danish population as of December
31, 2023, and 13.2% of the Swiss population as of February 2022 (Source: OC&C Report); and

- evidence that penetration can reach or exceed 20% in more mature markets, such as in the US,
Sweden and Norway (Source: OC&C Report).

We believe that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this substantial market penetration opportunity
as market leader in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland with a long, successful track record
of opening new gyms and rapidly growing membership, revenue and profitability. As more sites are
rolled out, gym penetration is projected to reach 17% in the United Kingdom by February 2028 (Source:
_OC&C Report)._

Furthermore, smaller, less well-capitalized value operators will, we believe, seek to exit sites rather than
reinvest or recommit to leases when facing competition. In continental Europe, growth will also come
from improvements to our existing sites, such as by reducing costs through operational efficiencies,
reequipping and reinvesting in our core sites and reconfiguring and consolidating our estate, rather than
solely from new site roll-out.

Finally, we seek to establish ourselves as the clear number one gym operator and maintain our position
as the leading value fitness operator in each of our core markets. In the UK and Denmark, we are by a
considerable distance the largest operator by volume of sites and membership. Furthermore, in the UK
we are the largest fitness brand with un-paralleled levels of consumer awareness and consideration.

**_Continue to lead in technology, innovation and operational excellence_**

We plan to continue leading in technology, innovation and operational excellence in a number of ways,
including:

- _Investing in our industry—leading technology platform—we continue to invest in our technology_
platform. The “front end” consists of both websites and mobile applications, where our members
can book classes, pay for their memberships and other ancillary services. The “back end” includes
all the investments made to continue to develop leading edge revenue and product management as
well as big data, BI and automated performance management applications. In all cases, we are
investing to ensure we can deploy similar technology capability in all of our geographies and
languages. We believe that our data and analytics model is best in class. As the fitness industry
increasingly converges with the digital sector, we believe that our technology platform allows our
members to more easily access and purchase our services, which helps us attract and retain
members. Additionally, our technology-enabled platform allows us to analyze user-specific data,
which in turn supports our operational performance. This allows our management to better control

10


-----

all aspects of our pricing strategy, product development and promotional activities. Furthermore,
the development of our technology is ongoing, and we plan to continue to utilize technology in
order to further reduce costs and improve efficiencies.

  - We believe that an “omni-channel” approach to fitness is increasingly expected by consumers,
and therefore we plan to continue to invest in our digital and connected offering and will
further deploy our own and third-party resources to develop software and content to deliver
our digital proposition.

  - Our approach seeks to serve a broad range of consumer needs by creating digital enablement
for members to get more out of their workout, whether at home or in the gym. This ranges
from simple digital workout classes for beginners to more sophisticated training programs
using best-in-class content from around the world. To optimize our personal training offering,
we also plan to create digital tools to facilitate the process of finding and interacting with our
large network of fitness professionals. We continue to use our scale and expertise to find
innovative means of using our digital capability to allow members to get the most out of their
workouts as well as measure, track and reward their progress.

- _Driving Average Revenue Per Member— we take a multi-layered approach to increasing ARPM_
by:

  - _Developing new commercial products—we have implemented and continue to develop new_
attendance/membership options to attract certain types of new members to our gyms and
increase our fee yields while consistently offering excellent value for money. For example,
we have continued to see an increase across our gyms in penetration of our premium
membership and bolt-on products, which include benefits such as the ability to pre-book
classes on a priority basis or obtain multi-site access and typically cost about £5 to £10 more
than a “Core” membership option on average and about £3 to £8 more for specific bolt-on
elements, respectively.

  - _Price progression—we have a sophisticated price management model, which utilizes variable_
pricing for our membership products based on local market demand and dynamics for each
site. Our operational experts tailor pricing to specific local markets and monitor and change
the specific prices over time as the market and its competition evolve. In turn, this allows us
to monitor member enrollment, manage capacity and maximize revenue and returns. For
example, in January 2023, we implemented a price rise in Denmark which resulted in ARPM
for the Group, as at June 30, 2023, increasing over 4% year-over-year to £24.55 from £23.68,
driving a 16.7% revenue growth in the six months ended June 30, 2023 when compared to the
same period ended June 30, 2022.

  - _Ensuring promotional investment is optimized and ARPM leakage is minimized—the value_
fitness market responds well to promotional activity, but it is crucial that this is managed
efficiently as otherwise excess value leakage takes place. We use our increasingly
sophisticated technology platform to target promotional investment at the right time for the
right duration, in the right places and using the right mechanics. We measure the true
efficiency and effectiveness of investments carefully so that plans can be optimized.

  - _Increasing ancillary sales per visit—ancillary sales are part of our initiative to increase_
ARPM. For example, we offer sports and energy drinks and protein snacks for purchase
through on-site vending machines.

  - _Optimizing site capacity—we seek to optimize the capacity utilization of our existing gyms_
where this is possible and viable. Capacity optimization can involve the physical extension of
gyms, or the redesign of certain aspects of gyms to eliminate site-specific utilization
bottlenecks, such as the substitution of low utilization equipment, or the installation of
additional automated entry portals or access gates to increase capacity.

11


-----

  - _Marketing and CRM—we have strengthened our marketing approaches and we take an_
increasingly sophisticated and data-driven approach to membership acquisition and retention.
Our brand awareness is strong but has further room for significant growth in the context of
our large estate of gyms. We utilize channels, such as television advertising and social media,
to increase brand awareness and drive membership growth. Additionally, our industry-leading
“front end” technology platform, including our mobile apps and websites, remain a low-cost,
high volume membership acquisition and marketing tool.

  - _Development of new sales channels and cross marketing—we are leveraging our nationwide_
scale across our key markets to identify opportunities to partner and enter into commercial
arrangements with large corporations, health insurance providers and employee benefit
portals that have the potential to deliver incremental membership volumes.

  - _Maintaining a rigorous focus on cost containment—our ability to offer low membership fees_
and generate strong unit economics and ROCEs is underpinned by our low-cost operating
model. As a result, we are focused on optimizing and controlling gym-level operating costs,
as well as Initial Capital Investment Costs. These costs are controlled centrally, and we intend
to continue to leverage our growing scale in order to achieve more favorable purchasing terms
with third-party suppliers, service providers and contractors. In addition, we are pursuing a
number of ongoing operational efficiency projects, such as energy saving initiatives, to
minimize future gym-level cost increases and improve returns.

  - _Capture full value of embedded value tailwind—following our return to 2019 UK revenue_
levels, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive strong performance in the future based
on our systematic and carefully managed approach to site enhancements and implementation
of our operational and pricing model in both our core estate and new site openings.

Management has successfully contained costs at the operating level, with cost inflation of only 0.5%
over the three year period from 2019 to 2022 on a like-for-like basis. Our structurally low operating
costs delivers and supports our gym site EBITDA margin of over 30%.

Furthermore, continued efforts from management on procurement and operating efficiencies are such
that operating cost inflation for 2023, compared to 2022, is expected to be contained below 5%, which
will largely be offset by yield progression, due to operational efficiencies in the period.

In particular, management has successfully focused on containing energy and utility costs, now and
through the end of 2024, as a result of obtaining future supply contracts fixing energy prices at moderate
rates, including future supply contracts for an estimated 90% of likely supply needs. This, together with
significant resources deployed on an initiative to reduce energy consumption across the Group by up to
20% over the next 12 to 24 months, means that energy cost increases across the Group are expected to
be limited to between £5 million and £8 million for 2024, when compared to 2022.

**_Apply PureGym operational excellence/best practices throughout our portfolio_**

We have a track record of successfully integrating acquired portfolios and driving value from such
acquisitions. Our acquisition of LA Fitness in 2015 (net 31 sites acquired) and Soho Gyms in 2018 (net
nine sites acquired) are good examples of this. In both instances, we have seen significant value creation
and performance uplifts. Following the acquisition of LA Fitness, we created significant value and
performance uplifts through active intervention, including implementing our technology platform,
operating model, performance management, refurbishment and cost synergies, which resulted in
doubling EBITDA from £10 million to £20 million post-acquisition. With respect to our acquired sites
in continental Europe, we have substantially rebranded the businesses and have implemented all of the
above.

In markets, such as Denmark, where we are targeting a growth in margin, EBITDA growth will derive
from improvements in the business rather than new site roll-out. The key levers to improve profitability

and margin are cost reduction (involving, inter alia, reductions in per-site operating costs), revenue
growth (driven by a simplified product range and roll-out of our variable pricing model), estate
rationalization (including a transition to a more focused, higher quality and more profitable estate that
is sustainable into the future) and estate upgrades, such as a comprehensive physical and digital refresh
and implementation of the PureGym SmartSuite (with a new website, mobile app, marketing
automation, changed ways of working and business rules).

**_Expand in existing markets and through franchising opportunities_**

We plan to expand in our existing markets through site roll-out, but also believe that as a scaled player
with a ready-to-deploy, technology-driven value model, we can successfully expand in markets beyond
our current areas of presence, organically or via acquisitions or franchising. Overall, through a
combination of new corporate-owned and franchised operated sites, we believe we could potentially
grow our estate to approximately 1000 to 2000 new sites with an estimated three to four million new
members, although this would depend on a number of factors and investment decisions relating to our
growth and entry into new markets. In our key markets, we intend to capitalize on strategically identified
local areas with whitespace in value gym offerings, and we are targeting to open 45 new corporateowned sites and 14 franchise operated sites in 2023 (with 22 new corporate-owned and seven franchise
operated sites already opened as of June 30, 2023). Additionally, we plan to capitalize on ample
whitespace in the UK and opening an estimated 300 new gyms in the long-term.

In 2021, we launched our franchise model, which brings an affordable, accessible gym proposition to
markets with limited access to such facilities and provides an exciting platform to expand the franchised
offering to other territories. Our franchise model allows us to develop our estate network across other
areas of the world, leveraging our core intellectual property and optimized operating model, and create
value through low capital intensive EBITDA growth.

We believe the opportunity for international development through franchising has the potential to be
very large. We believe franchising presents a significant growth opportunity in the medium term and
thereafter and believe that franchise unit economics can be attractive for both us and franchisees. For
example, we believe that current and prospective franchise partners could launch approximately 400
franchised sites by 2028 across the globe.

We believe that there is significant underserved demand for value fitness and gyms of the nature we
provide in the Middle East and Asia. In particular, we believe Saudi Arabia offers significant potential
for value fitness. In 2022, we entered into a regional development agreement with the Al Hokair Group
to develop a minimum of 130 franchise sites across the Middle East. As of June 30, 2023, we had 16
franchised sites currently in operation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, excluding sites in pre-sales. We
believe that in the fullness of time the Middle Eastern franchise opportunity could be up to 300 sites.

We also believe that the North American market presents an attractive opportunity given the lack of
scaled value players other than Planet Fitness, the leading franchised player. In 2022, we opened our
first three gyms in the United States, which are corporate-owned and under the brand PureFitness, with
the aim of testing our low-cost, technology-enabled concept in a new international territory. Having
successfully tested our three corporate-owned gyms, we are now targeting to secure five to ten
franchisees as operating partners in the U.S. over the next five years who have the potential for at least
100 franchised sites, in order to expand our footprint across the U.S.

We also believe that the Japanese, South East Asian and ASEAN and Indian markets could be strong
franchise markets for us due to their large populations, including 700 million across ASEAN countries
and 1.3 billion people in India, that are largely underserved by a strong value gym operator.
Additionally, Japan has a low fitness penetration rate of 3.3% and does not have a strong value operator.
We also believe South Korea has a strong franchising market, with a population of 51 million and a
higher fitness penetration of 7%. We are actively pursuing a number of contacts and business
development opportunities in these regions. For more information on our franchise model, see “—
_Franchise Model.”_

**_Sustainability and ESG are key priorities for us_**

Sustainability—and more broadly environmental, social and governance (“S-ESG”)-related issues—is
an important area of focus for us as concerns with climate change increase, consumers and employees
become increasingly engaged with this topic and the obligations being placed on businesses become
clearer on making progress on S-ESG issues to the satisfaction of both regulators and capital providers.

First, and foremost, we believe our business exists to provide a social good, as our core purpose—to
provide accessible, flexible and affordable fitness and activity to all—plays a vital role in not only
improving people’s health and wellbeing, but also as a route to addressing obesity, helping to prevent
illness and improving mental health. Additionally, our business is inherently sustainable as gyms are
effectively a part of the “sharing economy” and, especially in the case of low cost/high volume gyms
like ours, are a good, sustainable use of resources. Because members effectively “rent” access to the
gym facilities and equipment for the hours that they need, the equipment utilization is high and is an
efficient use of resources rather than further mass production of relevant equipment for each individual.

Notwithstanding this positive starting position, we recognize there is increased consumer awareness of
the link between societal trends and sustainability-related issues, and there is some evidence that these
trends are driving consumer demand towards companies that chose to pay more attention—and more
authentic attention—to issues in the S-ESG arena. Therefore, we believe it also makes good business
sense to be proactive in addressing S-ESG issues, as well as there being support for this from many
investors and a growing sense of the moral obligation on leading companies to play an appropriate role
in this regard.

Following engagement with key stakeholders—employees, members, investors and third-party
partners—we have identified five key focus areas in which to develop our S-ESG strategy:

- _Delivering Social Good—supporting as many people as possible to live healthier lives;_

- _Empowering People—fostering a thriving healthy team and community where everyone feels_
welcome and supported to reach their potential;

- _Energy and Emissions—reducing our carbon footprint and efficient use of resources;_

- _Waste & Circulatory—minimizing operational waste and embedding circular-by-design principles_
across our operations; and

- _Effective Corporate Governance—building an environment of trust, transparency and_
accountability for sustainable performance.

In 2022, we fast-tracked our decarbonization plans due to the emergence of the energy crisis, primarily
resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict which commenced in February of 2022. We have been
working with a market leading operational improvement consultant to identify and pursue opportunities
to significantly reduce energy usage per site. In doing so, we are in the process of establishing a new
“green” standard by which our operations are run, including new gym environment and temperature set
points; upgrades to LED lighting specification; control systems for better management of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning and, in some cases and where feasible, on-site renewable power
generation. A structured implementation program is underway with the objective of delivering
improved energy performance and broader environmental impact across our estate throughout 2023.
We are also continuing to develop measures of performance, targets and specific objectives for each of
the other emerging themes.

Our sustainability strategy approach to climate related risks and transition action plans are overseen by
the Risk and Sustainability Action Team (“RSAT”), which is chaired by our CEO and consists of our
Director of Strategic Sustainability and five other senior managers and executives. This committee
meets on at least a quarterly basis and oversees a prioritized program of work to address our key issues.

14


-----

The RSAT is further supported by external specialist advisers from time to time to ensure we are subject
to appropriate objective external challenges and contributions.

The RSAT reports, in writing, to the Board on a regular basis and the Board conducts an annual review
of our S-ESG strategy, progress and performance. In order to monitor our S-ESG strategy, the RSAT
prepared a climate risk register, which is regularly reviewed, and is developing S-ESG key performance
indicators. For additional details on our sustainability initiatives, see “—Sustainability, Environment,
_Social and Governance (S-ESG).”_

Based on preliminary results derived from unaudited management monthly accounts and other
information currently available, we estimate that our revenue for the month ended July 31, 2023
increased to approximately £45 million from £39 million for the month ended July 31, 2022,
representing an estimated increase of approximately £6 million compared to the same period in 2022.
This increase was primarily driven by a combination of member volume (from new sites, maturation of
existing immature sites and steady recovery in mature sites) and ARPM growth.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the month ended July 31, 2023 increased to approximately
£12 million from £9 million for the month ended July 31, 2022, representing an estimated increase of

16


-----

approximately £3 million compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to a
combination of revenue growth and continued focus on cost control.

We estimate that our Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the month ended July 31, 2023 increased to
approximately £130 million from £108 million for the month ended July 31, 2022, representing an
estimated increase of approximately £22 million. This increase was due to the factors outlined above.

In addition, we opened 4 new corporate-owned gyms in July 2023, increasing our total number of gyms,
including both corporate-owned and franchise operated gyms, as at July 31, 2023 to 584. Our members
for the month ended July 31, 2023 increased to approximately 1,869,000.

We estimate that our senior secured net leverage for the month ended July 31, 2023 decreased to
approximately 4.9x from 5.3x for the month ended July 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to
our increase in Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA and increase in cash on balance sheet for the month.

(1) We define “Mature gyms” as corporate-owned gyms that have been open for two full financial years or more as at the reporting date.

(2) We define total number of members as the total number of active members in corporate owned gyms, including the total number of
members who have suspended (to “freeze” or have “frozen”) their memberships, but excluding “pay-as-you-go” customers, the total
number of members who have cancelled their memberships and the total number of pre-opening members of organic gyms that have
yet to open, as of the specified date or the end date of the relevant period.

(3) We define average number of members per gym as the average of the number of members for each gym as of the beginning of the first
month and the end of every month in that period.

(4) We define average revenue per member per month as revenue for that period divided by the number of months in that period and further
divided by the average number of members during that period. The average number of members during that period is calculated as the
average of the number of members at corporate owned gyms as of the beginning of the first month and the end of every month in that
period.

(5) This measure is not defined under IFRS. It should be noted in this context that not all companies calculate the items that are not defined
under IFRS in the same manner, and that consequently the measures reported are not necessarily comparable with similarly described
measures employed by other companies. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit
for the financial period as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. Our
management uses these measures to assess our operating performance. In addition, we believe that similar measures are commonly
used by investors. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”

(6) We define “EBITDA” as profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation and impairment
of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization and impairment of intangible fixed assets profit/loss on disposal
of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications and exceptional administrative expenses.

(7) We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as profit or loss for a certain period before income tax expense, net finance cost, depreciation and
impairment of property, plant and equipment and right of use assets, amortization of intangible fixed assets, profit/loss on disposal of
property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, exceptional administrative expenses and other adjustments, after
adding back Pre-Opening costs and share based payment charges and subtracting the Cash Rent Adjustment.

(a) In the year ended December 31, 2020, exceptional items included £4.9 million of costs relating to the integration of the Fitness World
business into the wider Group, as well as other one-off costs, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also included income
relating to the settlement of a lease exit in the UK which totaled £10.9 million, of which £5.0 million was recognized in the year ended
December 31, 2020 and £5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Also in the year ended December 31, 2021, £10.9 million
of costs were incurred in the exploration of, and preparation for capital fund raising options, and costs of £0.7 million were incurred
relating to the exploration of expansion opportunities in the U.S. In the year ended December 31, 2022, a £1.4 million credit, as
compared to the £1.1 million credit in 2021, was recognized in relation to VAT recoverable on exceptional expenses in previous periods.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, exceptional items included costs related to the rebrand of our Danish operations to the PureGym
brand.

(b) Refers to the net impact of various one-off items not included in “exceptional administrative expenses.”

(c) Pre-Opening Costs represents the total of all gym site operating costs incurred during the pre-opening periods of gyms in that period.
Pre-Opening Costs primarily consist of staff and marketing costs.

(d) Cash rent adjustments represents the deduction of the cash rent payable during the period which otherwise was not reflected in EBITDA
(as reported on a post-IFRS 16 basis). From 2021 onwards, the Cash Rent Adjustment excludes the cash impact of COVID-19 rent
deferments. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA more closely reflects the underlying trading results of the Group for the period.

(e) Head Office Costs for a given period are defined as all non-gym specific costs, other than depreciation and amortization, related to the
operation of head office functions in that period.

(f) Fitness World pre-acquisition Adjusted EBITDA reflects Fitness World’s Adjusted EBITDA for the first 13 days of trading in 2020
prior to the Group’s acquisition on January 14, 2020.

(g) Run-Rate Adjustment is an adjustment made to those gyms which are less than three years old at the end of the reporting period. These
adjustments replace the Adjusted EBITDA earned by these sites in the last twelve month period with the projected Adjusted EBITDA
for their third year of operation. Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA therefore seeks to reflect the anticipated mature Adjusted EBITDA
potential of those gyms which were trading at the end of the relevant period. See “Business—Key Strengths—High cash flow generative
_profile underpinned by exceptional profitability and positive working capital cash inflows.”_

We believe that our gyms generate Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA at a mature rate at month 24, therefore months 25 to 36 represent the
first full year of mature EBITDA performance. We believe these run-rate adjustments are appropriate because, based on our experience
and the actual performance of gyms open fewer than two years, the first two years of operation are unrepresentative of run-rate trading.
Management has confidence in these gyms achieving their estimated run-rate profitability, given the consistent and predictable rampup delivered by the gym cohorts in previous years. These adjustments to EBITDA are presented for informational purposes only and
do not purport to present what EBITDA would have been had newly opened gyms been open for the entire period nor does it purport
to project EBITDA for any future period. The assumptions underlying the adjustments are based on our current estimates and they
involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated
future results or performance expressed or implied by such adjustments. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—Certain
_non-IFRS measures such as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results.”_

(h) In the 2022 Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, certain line items for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were restated to correct for computational errors

associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. In line with the IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not presented and therefore the_
information shown here reflects that originally reported. Had the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 been
presented on a restated basis, the revenue for the year would be £0.1 million lower, other administrative expenses £2.7 million higher
(due to associated impairment charges) and the resulting loss for the period would be £2.8 million higher than those presented above.
For further information see note 30 of our 2022 Financial Statements and note 15 of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial

_and reclassifications,” “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Correction of Errors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to_
_our Business—Any failure or weakness in our internal controls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results_
_of operation.”_

(9) We define “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by revenue for that period.

(10) We define “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA including Run-Rate Adjustments.

(11) We define “Operating Cash Flow” as Adjusted EBITDA plus Working Capital Cash Flow and less Maintenance and Refurbishment

Capital Expenditure cash flows for that period.

the periods presented:

(a) We define “Working Capital Cash Flow” as cash movements in working capital.

(b) We define “Maintenance and Refurbishment Capital Expenditures” as the total capital expenditure cash flows incurred in a period
less Expansionary Capital Expenditure cash flows incurred in that period.

(c) We define “Operating Cash Flow Conversion” as Operating Cash Flow for that period divided by Adjusted EBITDA for that period.

(d) In the 2022 Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, certain line items for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were restated to correct for computational errors
associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. In line with the IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not presented and therefore the_

_our Business—Any failure or weakness in our internal controls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results_
_of operation.”_

(13) _As adjusted Net Debt as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 is pro forma for the Transaction and represents total senior_

secured indebtedness of the Group of £677.1 million (composed of the Notes (£805.0 million (equivalent)), which represents
£          million principal amount of Sterling Notes and €          million principal amount of Euro Notes at the average LTM
exchange rate as of June 30, 2023 of €1.152 per £1.00) less cash and cash equivalents of £127.9 million (composed of cash on balance
sheet of £180.3 million of the Group, plus cash on balance sheet of £30.9 million held by our parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited,
_less the use of £83.3 million of cash to be used to redeem a portion of the Existing Notes and pay certain transaction fees, accrued and_
unpaid interest, redemption premium, miscellaneous expenses and other payments incurred on completion of the Offering). Pro forma
cash and cash equivalents following the Transaction will vary depending on several factors, including the actual amount of fees, accrued
interest, redemption premium, break costs and expenses compared to our estimates and the actual Issue Date.

(14) Ratio of as adjusted Net Debt of to Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is pro forma for the Transactions and the application of the proceeds

therefrom.

(15) In the 2022 Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, certain line items for the

years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were restated to correct for computational errors
associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. In line with the IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not presented and therefore the_

the Issuer and the Guarantors as of the Issue Date, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any
Permitted Collateral Liens (the “Collateral”). See “Description of the
_Notes—Security.”_
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that lenders under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness permitted to
be secured by the Collateral will receive the proceeds from the
enforcement of security over, and certain distressed disposals of, the
Collateral in priority to holders of the Notes. See “Description of the
_Notes—Security”_ and “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_

_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained_
_in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before_
_purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial_
_may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the events_
_described below were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be_
_materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may_
_not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your_
_investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended to provide an indication of the_
_likelihood of their occurrence or their severity or significance._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains_ “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks relating to our business**

**_The success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain gym members, while_**
**_maintaining sustainable and profitable membership fees._**

Our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain members to our gyms. We generate almost
all our revenue from membership fees. As a result, we must continually engage existing members and
attract new members to maintain or increase our gym membership levels. In addition, as most of our
members do not enter into any fixed-term contracts, they can usually terminate their membership with
little to no notice without penalty. If we are unable to attract and retain gym members, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

One of the most significant factors affecting our ability to attract and retain members is the membership
and joining fees we charge. However, we are also dependent on our ability to charge membership and
joining fees at a level that both attracts members and generates an appropriate fee yield relative to our
costs. While we have certain flexibility on a gym-by-gym basis to vary the membership fees we charge
existing members and the membership and joining fees we can charge to prospective members, our
ability to increase such fees to offset potential cost increases while maintaining or increasing
membership levels may be limited. Furthermore, we may even need to vary membership fees or joining
fees over time to maintain or increase membership levels. If we cannot sustain profitable membership
fees to offset the costs of operating our gyms, this would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Additional factors that could lead to a decline in membership levels, prevent us from increasing
membership levels, or negatively affect the fees we can charge members include:

- direct local competition from value and other health and fitness club operators;

- saturation of local health and fitness club markets;

- harm to our reputation or brand;

- a decline in our ability to deliver a high-quality service to our members;

- changes in consumer preference away from the value gym offering to gym offerings with more
amenities or that offer specialized, trend-driven exercises;

- changes in consumer preference away from the value gym offering in favor of centralized online
group exercise reservations to a variety of local gyms and specialized studios;

33


-----

- increasing popularity of home fitness equipment, fitness apps and other online exercise programs;

- increasing popularity of studio gyms and outdoor fitness activities;

- a decline in the public’s interest in health and fitness;

- a decline in time available for consumers to pursue leisure activities;

- changes in discretionary consumer spending habits due to deterioration of general economic
conditions in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland, as well as demographic shifts in these markets;

- changes in the level of positive referrals from current and former members, due to a decline in our
ability to deliver high-quality services or from harm to our reputation or brand or other reasons;
and

- the impact of any future COVID-19 resurgence or any other future pandemic on our business. See
“—The negative impact of COVID-19 and the related lockdowns on our business was significant
_and future effects could materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results_
_of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control.”_

In order to continue to attract and retain members, we have to be able to respond to consumer sentiment,
which may change rapidly and as the result of forces outside our control. If we fail to respond to such
changes quickly, we may lose a significant number of members. A decline in membership levels,
membership and joining fees and profitability as a result of any of the above factors, individually or in
aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_If we are unable to identify and secure sites on favorable terms for new gyms that meet our_**
**_selection criteria, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy._**

An important part of our growth strategy is the opening of new gyms. As we lease all our gym sites, we
are dependent upon finding and securing new leasehold sites at which to open new gyms. We employ
an extensive site selection strategy that incorporates a number of selection criteria such as site size,
location, configuration, local population density, demographic characteristics of the local catchment,
proximity of transportation networks, availability of car parks and local competitive dynamics, among
other criteria. Our ability to identify and negotiate financially acceptable lease terms for new sites may
be adversely affected by the availability of suitable sites that meet our selection criteria, fluctuations in
the property rental market or significant competition for suitable sites from competitors, other
commercial enterprises such as retailers, leisure and office space operators and residential operators.
As a result, we may be unable to identify suitable sites and secure them at rental prices or on terms
acceptable to us, or in a timely manner. If we are unable to secure sufficient sites that meet our selection
criteria at acceptable rental prices within the planned roll-out timeframe, we may not be able to
implement our growth plan.

Any inability to identify or secure sites on favorable terms for new gyms, including for any of the above
reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

**_The locations of our gyms might not continue to be economically viable._**

The locations of our gyms have significant influence on their results of operations. We cannot be certain
that current locations will continue to be economically viable over a long-term timeframe. As
demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive and
profitable. A decrease in the population of neighborhoods where our gyms are located or adverse
economic conditions in these areas and those surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced
revenue in those locations. Furthermore, we may relocate or open gyms in new areas in anticipation of
future development, which ultimately may not materialize.

34


-----

**_Our gyms may not achieve expected or minimum financial performance levels or ROCEs, which_**
**_may negatively impact our financial performance._**

We generally target a minimum Mature Gym ROCE of 30% per organically opened gym. If our gyms
do not achieve expected membership levels or membership fees, then the financial performance of the
gyms may be negatively impacted, resulting in a lower ROCE. The financial performance and ROCEs
of gyms can also be negatively impacted by higher than expected operating, maintenance and property
costs, or if such gyms experience higher than expected Initial Capital Investment costs, refurbishment
costs and Pre-Opening Costs. We may not be able to recover the capital investment required to develop
and operate our gyms.

Our expectations for the financial performance and Mature Gym ROCEs of our gyms, including future
gyms to be opened, can be influenced by a wide variety of factors such as incorrect analyses of the
suitability of sites, future changes in competitive dynamics or higher levels of future cost inflation,
among numerous others. See “—The success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain
_gym members, while maintaining sustainable and profitable membership fees,” “—Our low-cost_
_operating structure is one of our primary competitive advantages, but many factors could affect our_
_ability to control costs” and “—Our lease costs may increase, which may negatively impact our_
_profitability.” As a result, our New Gyms, which have been open for less than 24 months, or future_
gyms to be opened may take longer than expected to reach minimum or targeted levels of financial
performance or ROCE, or may never reach such minimums or targets. Additionally, ROCE of our
Mature Gyms, which have been open for 24 months or more, may decline as a result of similar factors.
We might decide to close our gyms that are underperforming and may incur unrecoverable costs due to
terminating leases and employment agreements. If our gyms do not achieve minimum or targeted levels
of financial performance or ROCE due to lower than expected membership levels and/or membership
and joining fees, or higher than expected property, maintenance and operating costs, or higher than
expected fit-out, refurbishment or Pre-Opening Costs, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our low-cost operating structure is one of our primary competitive advantages, but many factors_**
**_could affect our ability to control costs._**

We believe that our low-cost operating structure is one of our primary competitive advantages.
However, we have limited control over many of our operating and capital costs and costs may increase
in the future. For example, labor costs may increase due to, among other things, increases in minimum
pension contributions or changes in labor laws (including any potential re-characterization of
independent contractors as employees) or intense competition for qualified personnel or fitness
professionals. Additionally, the cost of certain service providers’ services, such as cleaning and site
construction, may increase due to increases in the UK “national living wage” or similar laws in
Denmark, Switzerland and the United States. In addition, although we have energy pricing contracts in
place that provide us with price protection over 100% of all energy usage in the UK and 80% of energy
usage in Denmark until at least December 2024, we have limited control over the cost of water and
business rates, the price and availability of insurance, corporate taxes, the cost of meeting changing
regulatory requirements and the cost to access capital or financing. These and other costs, including the
costs of developing and fitting out and refurbishing our sites, may increase due to inflationary pressures
or other factors. If we experience such cost increases and are unable to offset these cost increases by
increasing membership levels or membership and joining fees or achieving other cost efficiencies, such
cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

**_Our lease costs may increase, which may negatively impact our profitability._**

Property leases constitute a large component of our operating commitments. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, total cash outflow on property lease rental was approximately £66 million in the
UK and £35 million in Denmark and £9 million in Switzerland, representing 14%, 7% and 2% of our
revenue, respectively. Our leases in the UK generally have upwards-only rent adjustments every five

35


-----

years that are typically in line with the retail prices index (the “RPI”) subject to a 0–2% per annum
collar and 3–4% per annum cap. Our rent increases in Denmark and Switzerland are adjusted annually
and typically range between 0.5% and 3%, and in Switzerland range between 0% and 2%. However,
some of our leases in each market have differing terms, which include open market rent reviews and
fixed rent uplifts. For example, in Denmark, our gyms located in shopping centers are subject to us
becoming a member of the center in which our gyms are located and paying a marketing contribution
to the association. Imposition of such further financial obligations with respect to shopping centers are
usual in Denmark. These uplifts are all considered in our investment appraisal models and in our
business model, however if we are unable to deliver revenue growth or reduce other costs in response
to potential future increases in rents and related fees on our sites, then such increasing lease costs could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_If we are unable to renew our existing leases on favorable terms or at all, we may have to close_**
**_sites._**

We lease all our gym sites. Our ability to renegotiate financially acceptable lease terms for our sites
with expiring leases may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the property rental market, such as
increases in market rents or competition for sites from other health and fitness operators, commercial
enterprises such as retailers and office space operators and residential operators. Although the majority
of our UK leases benefit from the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, which provides security of tenure
at the expiration of the lease term, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our existing
leases on commercially acceptable terms or at all. The majority of our leases in Denmark are
non-terminable for ten years. Although we have historically encountered very few difficulties regarding
renewal of our leases, there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case.

If leases are not renewed, we may be required to find alternative sites to operate such gyms. We could
incur significant additional costs in identifying and securing suitable alternative sites or we may be
forced to close gyms in desirable locations if alternative sites cannot be secured. If gyms are closed, we
may be unable to attract members from those gyms to our other locations in significant numbers. Such
members may cancel their memberships due to, among other reasons, our inability to deliver the
services they require in a convenient location for them. If we are unable to renew our leases as they
expire, renew them on commercially acceptable terms or secure other favorable sites on acceptable
terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially
adversely affected.

**_We are generally unable to terminate our property leases for a specified time period from the start_**
**_of the lease and may be obliged to pay rent and pay losses if we close a location._**

We are generally unable to terminate our property leases before we can exercise our tenant-only break
rights, which can be found in the majority of our leases. These rights are generally exercisable at the
end of the tenth year of the lease term, although, in some leases, these rights are not exercisable until
the end of the fifteenth year of the lease term and in some leases, there are no rights at all to terminate
before the end of the lease term. In circumstances where we are unable to terminate our property leases,
we may not be able to sublet or assign our leases on commercially acceptable terms or at all.
Accordingly, if we close a gym prior to being able to exercise our tenant-only break right, or prior to
the end of the lease term in cases where it does not have a tenant-only break right, we may be obligated
to continue to pay rent and incur operating losses at the relevant site, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be unable to obtain the requisite planning permission to open new gyms and could face_**
**_delays in opening new gyms._**

When opening new gyms, we may require planning consents from local authorities if a potential gym
site does not already have the requisite use or planning permission. Additionally, the majority of our
gyms are open 24/7, which often requires various specific consents from local authorities. Any inability

36


-----

or delays in receiving such consents could restrict or delay our roll-out plans or increase our roll-out
costs.

We may also experience other unanticipated roll-out costs or delays in opening new gyms for a variety
of reasons, such as shortages of materials or skilled labor, labor disputes, construction issues and
modifications in design. Any delays in new gym openings or the failure to achieve any required
consents, including for any of the above reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The opening of new gyms near our existing locations may negatively impact our membership levels_**
**_and fees at our existing gyms and accordingly, the profitability of such sites._**

We intend to continue opening new gyms near certain of our existing gyms as part of our strategy. The
opening of new gyms in the catchment areas of our existing gyms may attract some members away
from our existing gyms for a number of potential reasons, such as the new gyms’ closer proximities to
such members’ places of work or residence. Although we take steps to mitigate loss of members from
our gym sites by using planning tools and modelling techniques, and flexing management decisions
accordingly, loss of members may result in lower revenue and profitability at our existing gyms, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_We may identify and pursue acquisition opportunities in the future, and we may fail to successfully_**
**_integrate such acquisitions, assume liabilities that we are unaware of, or such acquisitions may not_**
**_be as profitable as anticipated._**

As opportunities arise, we will continue to assess possible acquisitions of other health and fitness
operators, as well as select gyms from other health and fitness operators, to complement our organic
site roll-out strategy. Our ability to make such acquisitions could be affected by a number of factors,
including legal and regulatory changes, competition regulations, general macroeconomic, social and
political conditions and available capital.

Even if we are successful in identifying and acquiring target businesses, we may experience difficulties
in integrating targets into our business, may incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize the
anticipated benefits. Acquiring new businesses can place significant demands on management,
employees, suppliers, systems and resources and can expose us to new or unidentified liabilities. An
acquired business also may not perform in line with our expectations at the time of the acquisition.
Furthermore, we may not achieve the desired level of revenue or cost synergy benefits on integration
of new businesses or gyms and the cost of achieving those benefits may be higher than anticipated.
Failure to integrate acquisitions successfully or the manifestation of unexpected liabilities or costs
associated with such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected costs or liabilities resulting from acquisitions, which
may not be covered by contractual representations and indemnities. Although we typically conduct due
diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, we can provide no assurance that we will discover all
deficiencies, facts or material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a
successor owner or operator, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations.
Additionally, acquisitions may require the approval of governmental or regulatory authorities which
can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process, resulting in a failure on our part to proceed with
announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth.

Any acquisition or other strategic transaction we may undertake in the future could result in the
incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expenses and amortization expenses
related to goodwill or other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance
any such acquisitions.

37


-----

In identifying acquisition targets, we may incorrectly assess the market position, growth prospects of
the target business, or whether the business’ geographic location, equipment or other assets fit within
our existing operations. We may incorrectly assess the success of the location of the target business, as
well as the potential to enhance these locations following the acquisition. Unanticipated events or
liabilities relating to these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Such failures to achieve our acquisition target
performance goals and could in turn have material adverse effects on our revenue, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow.

**_We have recently entered into a franchising partnership, and may enter into additional franchise_**
**_partnerships in the future, and this presents disadvantages and risks such as our limited influence_**
**_and control over franchisees._**

In 2020, we entered into a franchising partnership with the Al Hokair Group, through which our first
franchise sites opened in Saudi Arabia. In the first quarter of 2023, the franchise expanded into the
United Arab Emirates, with its first two sites opening during the quarter. We are targeting 130 new
franchise sites in the Middle East in the next five years through our regional development agreement
with the Al Hokair Group. Entering into franchise agreements in new geographies entails certain risks,
as franchise arrangements present a number of drawbacks, such as:

- our limited influence over franchisees and reliance on franchisees to implement major initiatives,
limited ability to facilitate changes in gym ownership, limitations on enforcement of franchise
obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and inability or unwillingness of
franchisees to participate in our strategic initiatives;

- the need to have the support of our franchisees for marketing programs and any new capital
intensive or other strategic initiatives which we may seek to undertake, and the successful
execution thereof;

- the fact that franchisees are independent operators, and we cannot control many factors that impact
the revenue of our gyms, which directly affects the royalties and fees we receive from them;

- the fact that franchisees may be less directly interested in preserving or enhancing our brand image
and reputation than we are, and therefore, may not operate their gyms in a manner consistent with
our standards; and

- our limited influence over the decision of franchisees to invest in other businesses or incur
excessive indebtedness.

Although management will gain experience with each franchise we open, these risks will be amplified
as we open more franchised gyms with additional franchise partners. Additionally, we rely on positive
brand recognition to attract customers. Our brand could be harmed by the actions of any of our
franchisees. Any damage to our reputation, brand image or brand name through either a single event or
series of events involving, or due to perceptions regarding, our franchisees could have a material adverse
effect on our ability to market our gyms and attract and retain members, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The effect of any future pandemics could materially negatively impact the operations of our_**
**_business and, therefore, our financial position, due to many factors, some of which are beyond our_**
**_control._**

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and
governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
The governments of all the countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in
order to control its spread, and in doing so, required the temporary closure of all our gyms. Throughout

38


-----

all lockdown periods, our overall approach was to place members on “free freeze” and as a result almost
all of our revenues ceased.

We cannot predict whether subsequent waves requiring lockdown will occur or if another pandemic
will ever occur. Nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including
the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by the governments
and/or local or regional authorities of the countries in which we operate. Furthermore, any future social
distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further spread of disease may impact the
operation and member appeal of our gyms, such as significant wait times for exercise equipment or
protective equipment requirements and could cause members to cancel or suspend their memberships.
Additionally, policies implemented to mitigate the spread of disease have impacted and will continue
to impact our cost of doing business due to, among other things, the increased cost associated with
hygiene measures.

COVID-19 and the measures taken to respond to it have created an environment of uncertainty and
there can be no assurances that similar situations won’t occur again in the future.

**_Economic factors or a change in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, which are_**
**_uncertain and largely beyond our control, could negatively impact our membership figures, which_**
**_could adversely affect our revenue._**

Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by consumers (which is affected
by macroeconomic conditions that are beyond our control, such as depressed economic activity,
recessionary economic cycles, inflation, members’ income levels, financial market volatility,
investment losses, reduced access to credit, increased levels of unemployment, reduced home values
and increased foreclosure rates, slow or stagnant pace of economic growth, increased energy costs,
interest rates, mortgage rates, social unrest, political dynamics and other economic factors that may
negatively affect our industry), public health events and other factors described in this Offering
Memorandum. For example, since January 2020, inflation in the UK has risen approximately 8% on
the consumer price index and such inflationary pressures, as well as cost of living increases, have
impacted the consumer sentiment on spending in the UK due to potential disposable income squeeze.
Our revenue may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic
climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth
resulting from macroeconomic challenges.

Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, including the
ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security
requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure could have on our
operations, the economy, or members’ confidence generally. See “—The Russia-Ukraine conflict may
_have further adverse material effects on the global economy, energy supplies and prices.” Any of these_
events could affect members’ spending patterns or result in increased costs for us. Our revenue may not
increase in proportion to our fixed costs and deferred costs and, therefore, may not be sufficient to
support us through potential future economic turmoil. If our cost base is higher than our revenue, our
cash management policies may fail due to factors beyond our control.

Any of the above factors, or other unfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions affecting our
members or us could have an adverse impact on members’ demand for our services and may materially
negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Disruptions and failures involving our information technology systems could adversely affect_**
**_member enrollment, member services and financial and administrative functions._**

Our ability to enroll members, engage and market to our existing members, target former members to
re-join, process payments, control gym access, monitor security and engage in other critical business
tasks is dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted performance of our information technology
systems. In particular, disruptions or failures that affect our websites, gym access, marketing, billing

and other administrative functions could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. While
we fully back up all of our membership and business information using third-party locations and have
a full business continuity plan in place, any delay or failure on the part of the data back-up provider or
in executing our business continuity plan may hinder our ability to resolve information technology
system disruptions or failures in a timely and effective manner. Any disruption or failure involving our
information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

Any issues, viruses, data inconsistencies, outages, interruptions or security breaches in connection with
our information technology systems could cause significant disruption to the Group, and our members
may become dissatisfied if such disruption or failure interrupts our ability to provide our members with
access to our gyms or to other services. Member dissatisfaction may cause members to stop using our
services, cancel their membership or otherwise generate negative publicity, which could result in a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Some of our information technology systems, such as our membership management and billing systems,
are outsourced to third-party providers. In addition, we periodically update or change our information
technology systems. Any disruptions to our information technology systems as a result of a failure by
one of our third-party providers, or termination of our relationship with our third-party providers for
any reason, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

We are following a strategy that will see the migration of our current systems over time to a common
platform. This platform will be based on the eXerp system, which we currently use in the UK and
Denmark. The development of the eXerp system for PureGym Switzerland and the future transition of
PureGym Switzerland onto the eXerp system could take longer than expected, cost more than expected,
and lead to significant business disruption in the future, which could result in a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are subject to cybersecurity risks, and a cyber incident could occur and result in information_**
**_theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss._**

Given we are a technologically enabled company and hold a large amount of sensitive and potentially
valuable member information, we may be subject to cyberattack. In our ordinary course of business, we
collect personal information and maintain a large membership base electronically, which could be
subject to a breach of security. Unauthorized access, loss or disclosure of this information may lead to
legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption of operations and reputational damage.

Increased reliance on technology carries with it an increased risk of cybersecurity issues, including
phishing and end point vulnerability, which has been particularly heightened in light of the increased
amount of remote working. Such an attack could take a variety of forms, for example, a denial of
service/mass attack, penetration of network access in one of our sites or hacking into our network in
our offices. Successful penetration of our defenses against cyberattack could lead to the loss of member
data and the direct costs associated with this as well as broader reputational damage.

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against.
These threats may arise from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker
to alleged state-sponsored attacks. A cyberattack may be generic, or it may be custom-crafted to target
the specific information technology used by us. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance,
may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks
may not be sufficient. If, as a result of such cyberattack, our information technology systems were to
fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could damage our reputation and may be unable
to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

40


-----

As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to
continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability
to cyber incidents. While we believe that the actions being taken have and will continue to reduce our
cybersecurity risk, including putting a cybersecurity insurance policy in place, there can be no assurance
that our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will not be adversely impacted
by a breach of our cybersecurity systems.

**_Our success is dependent on our brand and reputation._**

We rely on positive brand recognition, among other factors, to attract and retain members. Brand value
or reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive
considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to our growth
strategies, our development efforts or the ordinary course of our business, such as:

- unsatisfactory customer service, which impact may be magnified by negative commentary on
social media;

- poor condition of a gym, including age of equipment, cleanliness or overcrowding;

- reductions in amenities after the conversion or refurbishment of an existing gym, for example,
when swimming pools or other amenities are removed from gyms that previously offered such
facilities;

- gym access or other issues resulting from a failure of our information technology systems; or

- breach or allegations of breach of legal and regulatory obligations, including health and safety
requirements.

Other incidents that may disrupt the gym experience of our members or generate negative publicity or
harm our brand or reputation may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control, such as:

- data security breaches or fraudulent activities associated with our customer records or electronic
payment systems;

- incidents related to member safety, such as physical, verbal or sexual harassment or abuse
(including, but not limited to, relating to gender diversity and designated changing areas);

- inappropriate member behavior;

- litigation and legal claims (including in particular in relation to COVID-19);

- third-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement of our intellectual property;

- fraudulent behavior by management or employees of the Group;

- the occurrence of a major incident at one of the gyms such as a flooding, major fire or a terrorist
attack; or

- illegal activity targeted at our gyms or others (for example, illegal use of gyms by non-members).

Failure to address, or appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode consumer
confidence in our gyms or our brand and may significantly reduce consumer demand for our gyms,
which may result in fewer memberships sold or renewed and diminish our ability to attract and retain
quality staff. Furthermore, negative commentary about our gyms may be posted on social media or
similar platforms at any time and may harm our reputation or business. Consumers value readily
available information about gyms and often act on such information without further investigation and
without regard to accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress

41


-----

or correction. Restoring our brand and reputation may be costly and difficult to achieve. If our efforts
to maintain our brand and reputation are unsuccessful, or if our brand or reputation are harmed due to
the above factors or otherwise, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects
could be materially adversely affected.

In addition, we face certain risks with respect to rebranding acquired businesses. Because we rely on
positive brand reception to attract and retain members, failure to successfully rebrand any acquired
businesses in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy or effectively manage our growth._**

Our growth strategy contemplates a significant expansion in the number of gyms we operate. Successful
implementation of our growth strategy will require significant expenditures before any substantial
associated revenue is generated. We cannot be certain that our recently opened or future gyms will
generate revenue and cash flow comparable with those generated by our existing mature gyms.
Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our new gyms, on average, will continue to mature at the same
rate as our existing gyms, especially if economic conditions deteriorate.

**_Our growth could place strains on our management, employees, information systems and internal_**
**_controls, which may adversely impact our business._**

Growing the number of gyms that we operate will place significant demands on our management
resources. We will be required to identify attractive gym locations, negotiate rental terms and open new
gyms on a timely and cost-effective basis while maintaining a high level of quality, efficiency and
performance at both mature and newly opened gyms. Moreover, we plan to diversify our offering in
certain ways, such as opening additional small box format gyms and opening in new markets, and we
could encounter unanticipated problems, cost overruns or delays in opening or growing revenue from
these gyms or in the market acceptance for our gyms. Our diversified gym offerings may not perform
to the same standard of financial performance as our gyms have historically performed. We will also
need to recruit and retain new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive,
accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations functions.

These processes are time-consuming and expensive and may divert management’s attention. We may
not be able to effectively manage our growing number of gyms, and any failure to do so could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may invest in new business lines, which may not achieve expected results._**

As part of our business strategy, we may diversify into new formats of gym, such as the small box
format and new lines of business within the health and fitness market in which we have not previously
directly participated.

New business lines may require the investment of additional capital and the involvement of our senior
management, which would divert management time away from other matters, such as our core
operations. We may be unable to successfully develop new business lines, or they may not perform in
line with expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_Our entry into new markets exposes us to additional risks and challenges associated with operating_**
**_internationally._**

Prior to our acquisition of Fitness World in Denmark and Basefit in Switzerland, we had no experience
owning and operating businesses outside of the UK. Our international operations expose us to additional
operational and market risk associated with operating internationally and may require significant
management attention and financial resources. Our international operations also expose us to additional

42


-----

regulatory oversight by the respective local authorities, as well as risks generally associated with
international business operations, including:

- governmental regulations applicable to the fitness industry and changes in such regulations;

- changes in social, political and economic conditions;

- limitations on foreign investment;

- restrictions on currency convertibility and volatility of foreign exchange markets;

- inflation and government measures to curb inflation;

- changes in local labor conditions; and

- changes in tax and other laws and regulations.

Exposure to each of these risks or other risks associated with operating internationally could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We plan to continue our expansion into the United States and may expand into additional new_**
**_international markets, which may have different market conditions and consumer preferences than_**
**_the UK, Denmark and Switzerland and expose us to other potential risks._**

In 2022, we opened our first gyms in the United States, three corporate-owned sites under the brand
PureFitness. We continue to methodically and carefully evaluate any further potential expansion
opportunities in the U.S. through franchise. In addition, we may consider potential expansion into other
new international markets either through the acquisition of existing gym portfolios, through organic
roll-out or through franchising opportunities. New international markets, such as the U.S., Japan, South
East Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”), India and South Korea, may
have different competitive conditions, market conditions, value gym penetration rates, consumer culture
and preferences and discretionary consumer spending habits than the UK, Denmark and Switzerland,
which may cause gyms in these markets to perform differently than our gyms in the countries in which
we currently operate and thus fail to deliver the expected financial performance and ROCEs. In addition,
any such future expansion would result in our operations being subject to new laws and regulations and
could increase costs associated with complying with existing laws, regulations or licensing and
authorization regimes. Expansion into new international markets could also subject us to risks related
to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Any of the above factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our inability to control our franchisees may limit our ability to implement our strategic initiatives_**
**_and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we mandate certain operational standards and
procedures through our franchise agreements, we may not be able to respond quickly enough to
franchisees that do not uphold these standards. There is also the risk that successful franchisees whose
operations produce significant revenue or a significant number of existing or future franchisees,
terminate their relationship with us or are unable to renew their franchise agreements with us for a
number of reasons, including low sales, high rental costs, lack of profitability or a desire to retire. Our
franchisees may not be able to or may decide not to renew their franchise agreements, or they may
terminate their relationship with us. If a substantial number of our franchises are not renewed, this could
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In
addition, franchisees could rebrand gyms under a banner owned by one of our competitors.

43


-----

**_If we cannot retain senior management, and retain and attract other key managers, we may not be_**
**_able to manage our operations successfully and pursue our strategic objectives._**

The successful implementation of our strategy is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate
high-quality senior management and other gym-focused personnel with experience and knowledge of
the fitness industry, including gym managers and regional managers, who play an important role in the
operation of our gyms. Availability of such personnel is limited and competition for such personnel is
strong. If we are unable to effectively recruit such employees and manage our employee turnover rate,
there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to meet our labor needs is subject
to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in any given
market, unemployment levels within those markets, wage rates, health and other insurance costs,
pension costs and changes in employment, labor or other workplace regulations. Increased competition
for qualified employees could lead to salary cost inflation. The departure of senior management
personnel or a failure to attract and retain other managers or qualified employees while simultaneously
controlling labor costs could delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified fitness_**
**_professionals._**

We engage fitness professionals in all our gyms. Our fitness professionals interact with members within
the gyms and form a core part of our value proposition to members. Availability of suitable fitness
professionals is limited and competition for them is strong. If we are unable to attract and retain our
fitness professionals the customer proposition could be diluted and staff costs could increase, which
could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we_**
**_grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and collaboration fostered within our organization._**

We believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe
fosters collaboration, innovation and adaptability through high growth. As we grow, employees and
independent contractors (including our fitness professionals) will become more dispersed, and we may
find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our culture. If we are unable to maintain
our culture, we may find it difficult to attract and retain motivated employees, continue to perform at
current levels or execute on our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Due to the capital-intensive nature of our business, we may incur additional indebtedness in the_**
**_medium term if our cash flow or current facilities cannot support our capital requirements and, if_**
**_we are not able to access additional financing or capital as and if necessary, our ability to operate_**
**_successfully or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be_**
**_adversely affected._**

Opening new gyms and maintaining existing gyms is capital intensive, and we require significant capital
to finance such activities, as well as to fund ongoing investments in our business and to meet our debt
obligations. We are pursuing a roll-out strategy in the UK and Switzerland and, although we believe we
have sufficient working capital for the next 12 months to achieve our strategy, there can be no assurance
that we may not need to incur additional indebtedness or substantially reduce our growth plans to meet
our capital requirements in the medium term. Raising new debt securities could increase our finance
costs or be available only on terms that restrict our business. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain
additional financing on commercially reasonable terms. For example, volatility in the financial markets
could increase borrowing costs and impact the availability of debt financing.

Any inability or delay in raising additional capital when and if required, or increases in borrowing costs
on any additional capital, may affect our ability to execute on our growth strategy or cause us to lose

future opportunities or hinder our ability to respond to competitive pressures, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our dependence on third-party contractors and suppliers for site fit out, equipment provision,_**
**_equipment maintenance and certain other products and services could result in disruptions to our_**
**_business._**

We rely on third-party contractors and suppliers for various critical services and products, such as site
fit out, gym equipment supply and maintenance services, facilities management services and certain
security and first-aid monitoring and response services, amongst others. Although we believe that
adequate substitutes are currently available, we depend on these third-party contractors and suppliers to
consistently and efficiently operate their day-to-day business. The ability of these third-party
contractors and suppliers to successfully provide reliable and high-quality services is subject to
technical and operational risks that are largely beyond our control. Any disruption to the operations of
our contractors and suppliers could impact our ability to service our existing gyms, maintain the quality
of our product offering and open new gyms on time.

If we lose such contractors and suppliers or such contractors and suppliers encounter financial hardships
unrelated to demand from us, we may not be able to identify or enter into agreements with alternative
contractors and suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms. Transitioning to new contractors and
suppliers may be time consuming and expensive and may result in interruptions to our operations. For
example, substantially all of our gym equipment in the UK is provided and serviced by Matrix, and, if
such relationship was terminated or if Matrix, were unable to honor their commitments for any reason,
we would need to find suitable alternative suppliers on short notice and may be unable to negotiate
equally favorable terms. Any significant increase in the price of gym equipment or difficulties in
securing the quantity of equipment we require to open new and maintain or upgrade existing gyms could
adversely impact our financial condition and results of operation.

If we encounter delays or difficulties in securing the products or services provided by our third-party
contractors and suppliers, there is a deficiency, lack of, or poor quality of such products or services
provided, our ability to serve our members and grow our brand and gym footprint would be interrupted.
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Our intellectual property rights, including trademarks and trade names, may be infringed,_**
**_misappropriated or challenged by others._**

We believe our key brands, “PureGym” and related intellectual property, are important to our
continued success. We seek to protect our trademarks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual
property by exercising our rights under applicable laws. We may also from time to time be required to
initiate litigation or other enforcement action to enforce our trademarks, trade names and other
intellectual property. Third parties may also assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated their intellectual property rights, which could lead to litigation or other enforcement action
against the Group. Litigation, whether pending, threatened or actual, is inherently uncertain and could
divert the attention of management, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could
negatively affect our membership sales and profitability regardless of whether we are able to enforce or
defend our rights successfully. If we fail to successfully protect our intellectual property rights for any
reason, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes our intellectual property, the value of
our brand may be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be unable to maintain the required level of insurance cover on acceptable terms or at an_**
**_acceptable cost._**

We might not be able to maintain general liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or
maintain a level of insurance that would provide adequate coverage against potential health and safety

45


-----

claims. Our insurance policies are undergoing renewal such that our policies are expected to be replaced
mid-October 2023, in line with the current expiration of our current policies. An increase in the number
of claims against health and fitness gym operators generally may result in the cost of insurance for the
industry as a whole to rise and comprehensive insurance coverage may become more difficult to attain.
Any increase in the cost of insurance in the market is likely to impact our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be forced to close gyms temporarily or other adverse consequences could result due to_**
**_unforeseen circumstances._**

We may be forced to temporarily close gyms in the future or other adverse consequences such as
property damage or personal injury due to any number of unforeseen circumstances, including as a
result of fire, flood, technical difficulties, loss of power, health and safety incident, terrorist incident or
natural disaster, or severe contagious disease such as COVID-19. Political crises, such as riots, terrorist
attacks, war and other political instability could also disrupt our operations. In the past, we have had to
close a small number of gyms temporarily, primarily due to flooding and close our estate entirely for a
period to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although all our gyms have reopened, we may in the future
have to temporarily close gyms again due to similar circumstances, such as potential lockdown
restrictions, or other factors outside our control. Any prolonged closures may adversely affect our
results of operations and may also result in longer-term reductions in revenue and profitability for a
number of reasons, such as termination of memberships by members of the affected gyms. Any losses
may be in excess of, or outside the scope of, our insurance. Failure to properly manage any temporary
closures could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_We may be exposed to the imposition of new taxes and the risk of changes in tax legislation and its_**
**_interpretation and to variances in the rate of corporate and other taxes._**

Future actions by governments to increase tax rates or to impose additional taxes could reduce our
profitability. Revisions to tax legislation or to its interpretation might also affect our financial condition
in the future. In addition, we are likely to be subject to periodic tax audits that could result in additional
tax assessments, which may be material, relating to past periods being made. Any such assessments
might also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Businesses in the UK are required to pay a tax for occupying a property, namely “business rates.” The
UK government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property market
approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect on April 1, 2023. As
announced by the UK Chancellor on November 17, 2022, the UK government agreed to a package of
support worth £13.6 billion over the next five years to support businesses at the 2023 business rate
revaluation, which included freezing the business rate multipliers at £49.9p and £51.2p in 2023 through
2024, as well as year-on-year upwards percentage caps on increases. Additionally, the UK government
agreed to continue to provide eligible retail, hospitality and leisure properties in England with a relief
scheme from 50% to 75% for 2023 through 2024, capped at £110,000 per business. The adjustments of
the business rates could result in increased estate costs and consequently could have an adverse effect
on the economic viability of certain gyms.

The tax laws and regulations in Denmark may be subject to change, and there may be changes in
interpretation and enforcement of such tax laws or regulations, such as changes to the VAT exemption
with respect to our services. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or
if tax laws or regulations are modified in an adverse manner, or if new tax laws or regulations are
introduced by the competent authorities with or without retrospective effect. One such potential change
may affect the above-mentioned exemption from VAT of our services. The Danish tax authorities issued
guidelines in July 2022 to the effect that part of our services could no longer be treated as VAT-exempt
activities. The guidelines are not yet in final form, but it is expected that they will be finalized and come
into effect during 2024. It is unclear to which extent the potential change in VAT treatment will impact

46


-----

our business as the potential change will allow for partial deduction of inbound VAT, but also increase
certain membership costs with an amount equal to the current VAT rate of 25%.

Business properties in Denmark are currently—as part of a transition period—subject to property taxes
based on land value (Ejendomsskat) and potentially an interim municipal service charge
(dækningsafgift). The applicable land tax rates vary within the Danish municipalities, but have generally
been within a range of 1.6% and 3.4% of the land value and set by the municipality in which the property
is located. The Danish property valuation system is undergoing revision with the aim of better reflecting
market value, and the new system will likely lead to upward valuations for properties in major urban
and industrial areas and downward valuation changes in rural areas, just as valuations will generally be
subject to ongoing adjustments. The property taxes are fully borne by the tenants (by contractual
agreement) and adjustments in the tax rates set by the local municipalities as well as changes in property
values could have an adverse effect on the economic viability of certain of our Danish gyms in the short
term.

As mentioned above, some properties used for commercial purposes in Denmark are subject to a
municipal service charge (dækningsafgift), but it is an individual discretionary decision whether the
municipality levies this charge on the landlord. In most cases, it is commercially agreed that these
charges will be borne by the tenant. The service charge is calculated on a parts per thousand basis (“per
**mille”) of the difference between the property valuation (ejendomsvurderingen) and the land valuation**
(grundværdien). The municipality can decide freely on the per mille level in the calculation, however,
the historical maximum is 10 per mille. Historically, the use of commercial properties for fitness
purposes has been exempt from such services charges. However, this practice is currently subject to
change and some municipalities in Denmark have started imposing service charges on gyms. Most of
the current leases of our Danish gyms are situated in municipalities in Denmark that impose service
charges on properties used for commercial purposes. If such municipalities were to take the position
that fitness purposes are not exempt from services charges, this change could have an adverse effect on
the results of operations of our gyms situated in such municipalities. As a consequence of the new
property tax regime in Denmark, from January 1, 2022 the municipal service charge is no longer
calculated separately, but in an interim period included as part of the property tax bill, and thus
calculated as part the land value taxation basis. Essentially, the municipal service charge is replaced,
and it is expected that taxation will increase for high value land with low value properties, and decrease
for low value land with high value properties. Certain percentage reductions in land value can be
expected in order to reduce future increases in taxation. For commercial properties, the new valuation
system is expected to be fully implemented as per January 1, 2024. There are certain legislative
maximum increase in threshold percentages set during the period 2024-2028.

**_Changes in foreign exchange may affect our results of operations and financial position._**

The results of operations and financial position of certain of our subsidiaries are reported in the relevant
local currencies and were translated into the pound sterling at the applicable exchange rates. The Danish
kroner, the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar, collectively, account for 35% of our revenue and 17.2% of
our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, results of operations and
the financial position of certain of our subsidiaries that report in these currencies are translated into the
pound sterling at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements.

The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the pound sterling in recent years have
fluctuated and our local currencies may in the future fluctuate significantly against the pound.
Consequently, to the extent that foreign exchange rate exposures are not hedged, fluctuations in
currencies may adversely affect our financial results in ways unrelated to our operations. Any of these
developments could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

not been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards and are subject to change. The unaudited data for the months of July 2023 presented herein
is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results and is based on
a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should not
place reliance on them when making an investment decision.

We have included unaudited data for the months of July 2023 in order to provide information about our
recent performance but this information should be treated with a higher level of skepticism for reasons
including but not limited to: unaudited management accounts are not prepared with the same level of
rigor and are not subject to the same level of management review and scrutiny as interim or year-end
financial information. Furthermore, unaudited management accounts may not provide for closing
procedures that are as detailed as those conducted at period or year end, including but not limited to the
preparation of accruals, statutory adjustments and true-ups and other closing procedures. Additionally,
unaudited management accounts may be subject to cut-off errors and misallocation of items between
months.

The unaudited financial information data for the months of July 2023 of the Group has been prepared
by, and is responsibility of, management. Our current independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, have not compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited financial
information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on
such information and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the unaudited
financial information. The auditor reports included in this Offering Memorandum relate to the Group’s
previously issued financial statements. The unaudited financial information data for the months of July
2023 of the Group should not be viewed as a substitute for full unaudited interim financial statements
prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and reviewed by our auditors.

This Offering Memorandum also incorporates unaudited data that is derived from management’s
projections. Such forecasts are based on assumptions and these assumptions underlying such internal
projections, targets and forecasts are based on our current estimates, perceptions, expectations and
intentions, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors such as macro-economic conditions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results
or performance expressed or implied by such assumptions.

Further, while we believe that the methodology used to calculate these unaudited internal projections,
targets and forecasts is reasonable, investors should be aware that there are certain limitations inherent
in our ability to accurately predict Adjusted EBITDA and revenues that may be achieved in the future,
and that the process of calculating such targets and estimates itself requires the use of other estimates
and assumptions, some of which require significant exercise of judgment. Among other things, our
unaudited internal projections for future periods may be impacted by different estimates and
assumptions, macro-economic conditions, and other business, economic and competitive uncertainties
and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and also beyond our control. Our unaudited
internal projections are forward-looking and, by their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur
in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance
and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the
industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forwardlooking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate
are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those

**_Certain unaudited non-IFRS measures such as Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate_**
**_forward-looking estimates that may differ from actual results._**

Certain unaudited expected or estimated non-IFRS measures, such as unaudited Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA, incorporate forward-looking estimates and assumptions made by our management.
Unaudited Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA replaces the unaudited Adjusted EBITDA earned by our gyms
that are less than three years old at the end of a certain reporting period with the projected unaudited
Adjusted EBITDA for their third year of operation. Unaudited Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is also the
figure utilized by certain of our creditors for assessment of covenants and leverage. Although we believe
that unaudited Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is a useful metric to describe the unaudited Adjusted
EBITDA before Pre-Opening Costs that our existing business may generate as we mature, we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in achieving forecast levels of unaudited Gym Site Adjusted
EBITDA within the timelines anticipated or at all. The assumptions we have made with respect to the
unaudited Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS Financial Measures that we represent in
this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such adjusted financial information.

Other companies, research agencies or market reporters may include other items or factors in their
calculation of similar metrics and may use certain estimates and assumptions that we do not use when
calculating these metrics. These factors may cause the calculations by others of similar metrics to differ
substantially from our calculations. None of the calculations of these measures should be considered in
isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under International Financial Reporting
Standards.

The unaudited financial information presented herein has been prepared by management. The
independent auditor of the Group has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures
with respect to such unaudited financial information for the purpose of our inclusion herein and
accordingly, they have not expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto
for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the unaudited financial information does
not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the period to which it refers. You
should therefore not place undue reliance on the information presented above.

**_Sustainability, environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and_**
**_reputation._**

There has been increased focus by regulators, consumers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders,
as well as by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social and
governance matters (“S-ESG”). Any failure or perceived failure to meet S-ESG targets or meet
consumer expectations for a proactive stance regarding sustainability, or loss of confidence could
negatively impact our business and may cause us to lose members. These impacts could be difficult and
costly to overcome, even if such concerns were based on inaccurate or misleading information, and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

Additionally, the increased focus has resulted in expanding and increasingly complex mandatory and
voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on S-ESG topics. These developments and other rapidly
changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, may alter the environment in which we
do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

49


-----

Standards regarding S-ESG initiatives could change and become more onerous for us to meet
successfully. Furthermore, if we are unable to comply with evolving regulatory and legal requirements,
we could be exposed to penalties which would have an impact on our reputation and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on S-ESG topics, and the results of
these assessments are widely publicized. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among
others, a company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance
with law and the role of a company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In
light of the increased focus on S-ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues
successfully, or that we will successfully meet society’s S-ESG expectations or achieve our financial
goals. As part of our commitment to S-ESG matters, we may introduce specific, quantifiable key
performance indicators. If we fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance indicators to
measure our progress towards our S-ESG goals, we may suffer reputational damage, which could in
turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**Risks relating to the industry**

**_The health and fitness industries in which we operate are highly competitive and we may fail to_**
**_compete effectively._**

The health and fitness industries in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland are highly competitive.
Competition for provision of health and fitness services is highly localized, and we compete with all
local public and private health and fitness operators, gyms and leisure centers offering exercise
facilities, including boutique exercise studios. Our competitors have opened and may open further gyms
or exercise facilities in the catchment areas of our existing or planned gyms.

Competitors, which may be new or existing operators, including companies that have greater resources
or greater name recognition than us, may compete to attract members in our current or prospective
markets. Non-profit organizations and local authorities in our markets may be able to obtain land and
construct gyms at a lower cost and may be able to collect membership fees without paying taxes or
receive preferential VAT treatment, thereby allowing them to potentially charge lower prices. Due to
the increasing number of value gyms in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland, we may face increased
direct competition in the value segment of the market, especially if the operators of such value gyms
charge lower membership prices than us or gain access to significant amounts of capital to enable them
to rapidly build new sites. In addition, because we do not have exclusive rights to many of the elements
that comprise our in-gym experience and service offering, competitors may attempt to copy or improve
on our business model, or portions thereof, which could erode our competitive position, market share
and brand recognition and adversely affect our prospects.

Some competitors may have lower fixed or variable costs, or have lower ROCE expectations than us,
which means that they may be able to offer lower membership fees for equivalent services. We also
face competition from operators offering comparable or higher pricing in conjunction with higher levels
of service and other amenities. There is also a risk that traditional mid-market and premium health and
fitness club operators may change their models and lower prices or create lower price brand alternatives
to more effectively compete with us.

In addition, individuals wishing to exercise have a wide variety of options available to them other than
using purpose-built health and fitness facilities. These include engaging in outdoor activities such as
cycling, running and group exercise programs, participating in other sports (including team sports) or
using exercise machines or weights, fitness apps or other online programs and offerings at home.
Furthermore, members may cancel or suspend their memberships in favor of certain exercise trends
such as increased competition from boutique gyms, home workout content and equipment providers,
such as Peloton, and low-cost or free online fitness platforms, all which could have an adverse effect
on our membership levels.

50


-----

In the UK, we face competition from other large value gym operators, namely the Gym Group and, to
a lesser extent, JD Gyms. In Denmark, we face competition from Fitness X (formerly Fitness 1), in the
value segment and to a lesser extent SATS from a broader market perspective. We face competition in
Switzerland from CleverFit and Non-Stop Gym, the latter of whom are increasing their presence and
have entered some existing PureGym catchments.

In response to competition, our business may from time to time make certain pricing, service, sales and
marketing or capital decisions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. If we cannot compete adequately, our growth strategy as
well as our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially
adversely affected.

**_Our success is dependent on the continuing popularity of health and fitness in the countries in_**
**_which we operate, and the popularity of value gyms in particular._**

Our success is dependent on the continuing popularity of value gyms in the countries in which we
operate. Alternative forms of fitness or venues for fitness may become popular and trends in the type
of gyms that consumers wish to join may change in the future. Changes in consumer preferences that
could affect us include, for example, a preference for in-home exercise, team sports, outdoor fitness
activities or studio-based group exercises.

There may also be a change in the public’s perception of the general benefits of exercise, which could
lead to less demand for gyms. In addition, the development of pharmaceutical drugs that lead to weight
loss may impact overall demand for our product. If we are unable to anticipate and adapt to consumer
preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to adapt our services on a timely basis, we may
lose members, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_We operate in the consumer sector and our business may be significantly adversely affected by_**
**_economic conditions and other factors in the countries in which we operate affecting levels of_**
**_disposable income and consumer confidence._**

We are exposed to potentially adverse developments related to changes in consumer preferences,
general deterioration in economic conditions and demographic changes in the UK, Danish, Swiss and
U.S. markets. For example, we have seen the implementation of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from
the European Union (“Brexit”). While it is still difficult to predict the full effect of Brexit on the
European and global economy, it could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and
a material adverse effect on the buying behavior of consumers. The resulting political and economic
uncertainty could also lead to further calls for other governments of other European Union Member
States to consider withdrawal from the European Union or the abandonment of the euro as a currency.
Such developments, or the perception that any such developments could occur, could have a material
adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global economy. Since our gym
equipment and certain other fixtures and fittings are manufactured overseas, the effects of Brexit could
disrupt the supply chain in certain geographies or cause an increase in cost due to currency movements.
The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the practical implications of the implementation of the
Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any future agreements (or lack thereof) between the United
Kingdom and the European Union and, in particular, any potential changes in the arrangements for the
United Kingdom to retain access to European Union markets.

Brexit and other significant economic developments or deteriorations could result in adverse economic
effects across the markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. These developments, as well as any
other adverse developments in macroeconomic conditions in the UK, Denmark, Switzerland or the
United States or the perception that any of them could occur, may result in the lower availability of
credit, higher interest rates, higher mortgage rates and tax rates, increased unemployment, higher
consumer debt levels, lower consumer confidence, lower wage and salary levels, inflation or the public

51


-----

perception that any of these conditions may occur, could adversely impact demand for gym
memberships in the countries in which we operate. Membership of a gym may be viewed as a
non-essential item and, in times of economic uncertainty or recession, members of gyms may terminate
or suspend their membership.

Macroeconomic conditions and uncertainties may also impact our suppliers in ways that would
adversely affect our business and results of operations, including supplier closures or increases in the
costs of products or services they supply. Lower levels of future economic growth, or any deterioration
in the economy or any of the factors mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Russia-Ukraine conflict may have further adverse material effects on the global economy,_**
**_energy supplies and prices._**

Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to, tensions between Russia and its neighboring
countries, including Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries, or acts of terrorism, could negatively
impact the macroeconomic environment and create a tough consumer environment that is challenging
for businesses worldwide.

In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched a significant military action against Ukraine,
which has resulted in sustained conflict and disruption in the region. We do not have any direct revenue
exposure to Russia or Ukraine; however, this conflict has led to significant market and other disruptions,
including significant volatility in energy prices and specific supply chain disruptions. To date we have
not experienced any material disruption to our operations, however, the length, impact and outcome of
the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable.

We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine, including the increase in energy prices associated
therewith, and are assessing its impact on our business. We have no way to predict the progress or
outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict and any
resulting government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration
of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could
potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of
time.

Any of the abovementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of
other risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**Risks relating to the regulatory environment**

**_We could be subject to material fines and claims related to health and safety risks at our gyms._**

Physical exercise and the use of our gym services and facilities, including exercise equipment, poses
potential health and safety risks, including serious injury or death, to members, employees and thirdparty contractors. For example, water hygiene problems could develop in our changing facilities that
may cause a potential health risk to members and employees, or an accident on the gym floor involving
fitness equipment could result in injury or death. We are also reliant on CCTV to ensure health and
safety during unmanned hours at our gyms and this technology may fail on occasion. We may be subject
to material claims asserted against us for any injury or death suffered by someone using our facilities
or services. We might not be able to successfully defend such claims and we may be liable for fines,
damages and costs in excess of, or outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Even with adequate
insurance, such claims may cause significant damage to our reputation and may have a material impact
on our ability to attract or retain members. Any such fines or claims may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Our operations and gyms are subject to various laws, regulations and planning and licensing regimes,
including in-person marketing, licensing, signage planning, advertising standards and noise abatement

52


-----

requirements. Some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present
and former owners, operators or users, including tenants, of sites for the clean-up of contamination at,
or arising from, such sites, without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. For example,
we have historically incurred costs for remedial actions when asbestos was discovered at a number of
gyms. Although we are not aware of any material actual or pending liabilities, claims or actions relating
to contamination of any of our current sites, future investigations may lead to discoveries of
contamination that we are required to remedy or damage that may subject us to claims or regulatory
proceedings. A breach of environmental regulations, standards relating to health and safety or marketing
and advertising or other applicable standards could potentially lead to the mandatory closure of a gym
or multiple gyms for a period of time. We may also be subject to claims by members and other visitors
alleging exposure to potentially harmful substances that may be present within our gym sites. We may
not be able to successfully defend against such claims or regulatory proceedings or our insurance
coverage may be insufficient to cover the costs of such claims. Any such actions may also lead to
negative publicity and adversely affect our ability to attract new and retain existing members, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

New laws, regulations and licensing regimes or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly
those relating to environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, tax, competition,
consumer protection, marketing and advertising practices, privacy and information security, may
require extensive system and/or operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase
our operating expenses or subject us to additional costs, fines or other penalties. For example, a change
in the VAT or other tax regimes applicable, or the application thereof, to our business may result in
uncertainty, disruption to operations and implementation costs, which we may not be able to pass on to
our customers. Compliance with, or any violation of, current and future laws, regulations or licensing
regimes could require material expenditures by us, expose us to government enforcement action and
claims by members or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Failure to comply with data protection legislation or a security breach or system failure in our_**
**_technical or information technology infrastructure could result in significant harm to us._**

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, transmit, store and otherwise process member and
employee data, including dates of birth, bank account details and other personal data, including sensitive
personal health data, in information systems that we maintain. We also maintain a large membership
database made up of prospective, current and former members. This data could be an attractive target
for cyber-attack by malicious third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including
organized criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled current or former employees and others. We are focused
on protection of member and employee data given these risks.

Furthermore, our processing of personal data is subject to numerous laws, regulations and standards
related to the protection of personal data, including, among others, the EU-wide General Data Protection
Regulation (the “EUGDPR”) which came into effect on May 25, 2018, and is supplemented under
Danish law by the Danish Data Protection Act (“DDPA”), which replaced the former Danish Act on
Processing of Personal Data. The UK General Data Protection Regulation (the “UKGDPR”), which
generally mirrors the EUGDPR, came into effect on January 31, 2020, as a direct consequence of the
UK leaving the EU, and it is supplemented under UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 (“UKDPA”),
which replaced the former UK Data Protection Act 1998. The EUGDPR, DDPA, UK GDPR and
UKDPA altogether set out more onerous and stringent requirements for controllers and processors’
processing of personal data, including expanded disclosure requirements. For example, when collecting
personal data, certain information must be provided to the individual whose data is being collected.
This information includes the identity of the data controller, the purpose for which the data is being
collected and other relevant information relating to the processing. In some cases, the consent of those
data subjects may also be required to process the personal data for the purposes notified to them.
Personal data may only be used for the purposes notified to individuals. Additionally, regulators now
have the ability to impose larger fines of up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million under the

53


-----

UKGDPR) or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year. In
addition to fines, regulators also have the ability to impose other sanctions such as injunctions and other
prohibitive orders.

We use a third party based in the U.S. for marketing purposes, which may involve the processing of our
member data, and thus, we are also subject to the EU laws on data export. We rely on a mixture of
mechanisms for the transfer of data to and from our EU business to the United States and could be
impacted by changes in relevant law. To illustrate the ever-changing landscape in this regard, it should
be noted that in its July 2021 decision, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the
previous EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the European
Economic Area to the U.S. and stipulated stricter requirements for the transfer of personal data based
on standard contract clauses. In July 2023, a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework was adopted by
the EU Commission, which may now again provide for smoother transfers of personal data to the United
States. Any future changes to the rules governing the transfer of personal data outside the European
Economic Area, may impact our business or results of operations and there can be no assurance that
future litigation and new agreements will not impact our business or results of operations.

We also use cookies and similar technologies for online behavioral advertising. In the UK, Denmark
and the European Union in general, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a
user’s device (except for strictly necessary cookies). The ePrivacy Directive as implemented into
national legislation covers the use of cookies and similar technology and direct marketing are under
reform. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to even broader restrictions on our research
activities, including efforts to understand user Internet usage and attract prospective users. Such
regulations may increase the costs for collecting or using online usage information, increase regulatory
scrutiny and increase the potential for civil liability under consumer protection laws. Similarly, changes
to direct marketing rules may also have a significant effect on how we market to prospective and current
members.

Compliance with evolving data, privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in
cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models
and the development of new administrative processes. Although we monitor the changes in law in this
regard closely and make an effort to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that we will be in
compliance at all times, and this could lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and
penalties or adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.

Despite the security measures we have in place to comply with applicable laws, regulations and
standards, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers, may be vulnerable to
security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced
or lost data, cyber fraud, programming and human errors or other personal data breaches and similar
events. A breach of data protection legislation involving the unlawful processing, misappropriation,
loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal data, including the use of such information for direct
marketing purposes, whether by us, one of our sub-contractors or service providers or an unrelated
party, could result in regulatory action, compensation claims, fines of £17.5 million (€20 million) or up
to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher,
potential loss of business and adverse publicity. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be adversely affected by the employment status of personal trainers operating at our gyms._**

Some of our UK and US personal trainers are self-employed contractors who use our premises to train
their clients. In the UK, we run the risk that we will have to make a back payment of taxes in the event
that our self-employed personal trainers are reclassified either due to a change in law or by the UK tax
or other relevant authorities as either “employees” or “workers” (a quasi-employment status) rather than
individuals in business on their own account. Historically, we had a different model in operation in the
UK, ‘Hours PTs’, who were personal trainers paying an annual license fee and providing 12 hours per
week of support time to use our facilities to train their clients. Our operating model has since evolved,

54


-----

and the Hours PT model is no longer a feature of the business. In December 2017, HMRC opened
inquiries into the payment of the national minimum wage by the Group to our employees in the UK.
HMRC closed the inquiry in July 2020 on the basis of insufficient evidence. HMRC stated that it
reserves the right to reopen the inquiry if it wishes in the future. In August 2018, HMRC opened
inquiries into the worker and employment status of the personal trainers. Subsequently, in July 2020
and March 2021, HMRC notified us that these inquiries had been closed on the basis of insufficient
evidence to either support worker or employment status. HMRC stated, however, that it reserves the
right to reopen this inquiry if it wishes in the future.

If a personal trainer were reclassified by the UK tax or other relevant authorities as an employee or a
worker, we could be subject to back payment of taxes and National Insurance contributions, as well as
claims regarding back payment of minimum wage, holiday pay, and potentially pensions auto
enrollment in connection with such reclassification. Aside from the monetary expense of participating
in any legal or regulatory proceedings on this issue and any damages, penalties or settlements resulting
from such proceedings, which may be significant, involvement with such proceedings could negatively
affect our brand and require management attention. Any of the above could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may be adversely affected by licensing regimes, tariffs or taxes._**

Any significant increase in the rates, taxes and other costs and tariffs levied by local municipalities
where our gyms are located or by the UK, Danish, Swiss or U.S. government could have a material
adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition if it is unable to control costs in other areas.
We have no control over the amounts levied and could experience increases in the future.

Compliance with and future changes to relevant planning laws and building regulations, or the
requirement to pay increased regulatory rates and taxes, could restrict or delay our expansion plans or
increase our costs. In addition, when modernizing, refurbishing or expanding existing gyms or opening
new gyms, we may require change of use or planning consents from local authorities. Any inability or
delays in receiving such consents could delay or inhibit our refurbishment, extension or new gym
opening plans or increase costs associated with these plans. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Laws, regulations and policies related to our business may change at any time and may adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

Our business operates on a flexible membership model. On April 25, 2023, the Digital Markets,
Competition and Consumers Bill (the “Bill”) was introduced in the UK’s House of Commons. In
addition to proposed reforms to digital markets, competition law, consumer protection and other
measures, the Bill seeks to enact increased regulations on subscriptions and would empower courts and
the Competition and Markets Authority to impose monetary penalties. The Bill may impose new duties
on our business, including, requiring disclosure of specific pre-contract information to consumers,
reminders of subscription renewals, additional options for consumers to cancel subscription contracts
and additional termination methods. The UK Government has indicated that one of the focuses of the
Bill is to tackle “subscription traps.” Our flexible membership options are core to our business model,
but the Bill, once enacted, may require extensive membership, system and/or operating changes that
may be difficult to implement and could increase our operating expenses or subject us to additional
costs, fines or other penalties. We cannot predict the duties and requirements of the final Bill, if or when
enacted, or their impact on our business. Although we continue to monitor the Bill and any further
changes in the law related to this matter closely and ensure compliance with respect to these matters,
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance at all times. This could lead to governmental
enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, which could have an adverse
effect on our reputation and business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

55


-----

**Risks relating to legal matters**

**_We must comply with sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and anti-_**
**_corruption laws across the jurisdictions in which we operate._**

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering laws and economic
sanctions programs in all jurisdictions in which we operate, including such laws and regulations
imposed by the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and the United Nations (in each case
to the extent applicable). In particular, our international operations may be subject to anti-corruption
laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act of
2010 and the local anticorruption laws of any jurisdiction applicable to us. In addition, our international
operations may be affected by sanctions and economic restrictions imposed by the UK Office of
Financial Sanctions Implementation, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union,
the United Nations, or other law enforcement agencies or sanctions authorities.

Any failure to effectively prevent, identify or address breaches of our legal obligations as a result of
inadequate internal controls, compliance management and risk management systems could result in
administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, the assertion of damages claims by third parties and
reputational damage, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, including litigation related expenses_**
**_and/or reputational damage, among other losses, which could harm our business._**

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other tax, labor, settlement and legal proceedings.
We cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of
litigation and other proceedings that may be filed by or against us, including remedies, settlement
amounts or damage awards, and adverse results in any litigation and other proceedings may materially
harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating
to contract claims, employee claims and intellectual property disputes, among others, as well as other
harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our control. In the event of a
negative outcome in any material legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement
agreement, we could be obliged to make substantial payments. Even if there is a positive outcome to
such proceedings, negative publicity and advisory costs, to the extent they are not reimbursable by other
litigants or insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

**Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees._**

We are highly leveraged and after the issuance of the Notes we will continue to be highly leveraged.
As of June 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering
and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total senior secured debt of £805.0
million, including indebtedness under the Notes. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow

56


-----

to fund new debt portfolio purchases, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint
ventures or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged;

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and

- limiting our ability to upstream cash from our subsidiaries to help meet our obligations under the
Notes.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to_**
**_operate our business._**

The terms of the Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to £175.5 million under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and additional Notes issued by the Issuer. The new debt that we incur in the
future, including for example in connection with acquisitions, may rank pari passu with, be structurally
senior to, or be secured by assets that do not form part of the Collateral for the Notes and the Guarantees.
Any such additional indebtedness could mature prior to the Notes. We may also enter into qualified
securitization facilities, pursuant to which we would pledge receivables that either do not form part of
the Collateral or would be released from the Collateral in connection with any such program. Although
the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances
the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. In addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able to designate some of our
restricted subsidiaries under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture as unrestricted
subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations
specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage.
See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement.” If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the_
related risks that we now face would increase.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to_**
**_take other actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

After the issuance of the Notes, we will have significant debt service obligations. Our ability to make
principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business.” If cash generated by our subsidiaries is
insufficient, we may need to draw on our New Revolving Credit Facility to make interest payments on
the Notes.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature three months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of
loans outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility and of the obligations under the Notes and
any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital

resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted
from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our
indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such
refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business obligations,
activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that
could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or
before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on
a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient funds to
meet our obligations under our indebtedness.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial
condition at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing
conditions in the international credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher
interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The
terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make
payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result
in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet
our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the
Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell
assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposal. We may not be able to carry out certain disposals
or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any
proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service
obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet
our debt service obligations.

**_Drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing cash flows._**

Drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will, and future indebtedness that we may incur
could, bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to SONIA (or in relation to advances in
euro, EURIBOR, or in relation to advances in U.S. dollars, term SOFR), or in relation to advances in
Danish kroner, CIBOR), or other benchmarks, as adjusted periodically. These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on
the Notes. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a
portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available
on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates or any drawings were to increase
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_The Issuer and certain Guarantors are holding companies, each of which has no revenue-_**
**_generating operations of its own and depends on cash received from its respective subsidiaries to be_**
**_able to make payments on the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other
than investments in its subsidiaries, including intercompany receivables. The Issuer’s material liabilities
will include the Notes, obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, liabilities under
the Subordinated Shareholder Funding and any additional debt it may incur in the future. See
“Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” As a result, the
Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, loans,
interest and payments on intercompany loans to meet its obligations.

58


-----

Similarly, certain Guarantors are holding companies and will be wholly dependent upon arrangements
with their respective subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may prohibit, the ability of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer to make cash distributions or dividends. Applicable tax laws may also subject
such payments to further taxation. The ability of the direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer to pay
dividends or to make other payments or advances, including payments on intercompany loans, will
depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to
which they may be or may become subject and, in some cases, receipt of such payments or advances
may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of
our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even
prevent such payments. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have
no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes.

Pursuant to the Danish Companies Act (Consolidated Act No. 1451 of 9 November 2022 as amended,
_selskabsloven), the ability of the Danish Guarantors and other direct and indirect Danish subsidiaries of_
the Issuer to make dividends to assist in servicing the Notes and other debt will be subject to certain
restrictions, including (i) that the relevant Danish company has sufficient distributable reserves to
declare and pay the proposed dividend; and (ii) that the board of directors of the relevant Danish
company considers that the amount of the proposed dividend is appropriate having regard to the
financial position of the relevant Danish company and its subsidiaries.

Pursuant to Swiss statutory corporate law, the ability of the Swiss Guarantor to pay dividends to assist
the Issuer in servicing the Notes and other debt will be subject to certain restrictions, including (i) that
the Swiss Guarantor has sufficient distributable profits from the previous fiscal year or the current fiscal
year, or the Swiss Guarantor has freely distributable reserves (including statutory capital contribution
reserves, which are also referred to as additional paid-in capital), each as presented on the Swiss
Guarantor’s audited annual standalone statutory balance sheet or audited interim standalone statutory
balance sheet, respectively, and (ii) the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a relative majority of
the votes cast at a general meeting of shareholders (not counting broker non-votes, abstentions and
blank or invalid ballots) approving the distribution of dividends. The board of directors of the Swiss
Guarantor may propose to its shareholders that a dividend or other distribution be paid but cannot itself
authorize the distribution.

The inability to transfer cash among entities may mean that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may
have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary
transfers from one entity to another entity in order to make payments to the Issuer in order for it to meet
its obligations under the Notes.

**_The Indenture governing the Notes and the agreement governing our New Revolving Credit_**
**_Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from_**
**_pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business._**

The Indenture governing the Notes and the documentation governing our New Revolving Credit
Facility will contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that limit our and our
restricted subsidiaries’ ability to:

- transfer or sell assets or use asset sale proceeds;

- incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred equity securities;

- pay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;

- make certain investments;

- create or incur certain liens on our assets;

59


-----

- incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;

- enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

- (in the case of the Issuer only) engage in activities other than certain permitted activities; and

- take or omit to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the
collateral securing the Notes.

Our ability to borrow under our New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to compliance with these
covenants, as well as a senior secured net leverage financial covenant applicable under some
circumstances. In the event we breach our financial covenants, we would be in default under our New
Revolving Credit Facility, which could allow the lender to declare all amounts outstanding under our
New Revolving Credit Facility to become due and payable. Additionally, an acceleration event under
one debt instrument could allow for acceleration under other debt instruments with cross-acceleration
provisions (including the Notes). If this happens, there would be a material adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations.

Further, the restrictions in the Indenture governing the Notes and in the agreement governing our New
Revolving Credit Facility may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best
interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy
or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We also may incur future debt
obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and
operational flexibility. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these
agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements, or that we will be able to
refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The breach of any of these covenants and
restrictions could result in a default under the Indenture governing the Notes or under the agreement
governing our New Revolving Credit Facility. An event of default under our New Revolving Credit
Facility could permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and
payable.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries are not
expected to guarantee the Notes. Such subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of debt or preferred
stock of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these
assets are made available for distribution to the direct or indirect shareholder of any such subsidiary.
Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

- the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled
to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer
or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions
from such subsidiary.

As of June 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries
would not have had any third-party financial indebtedness. The consolidated financial statements
included in this Offering Memorandum refer to the Group and therefore contain information on both
Guarantors and non-Guarantors. As of the Issue Date, the Guarantors will constitute substantially all of
our Adjusted EBITDA. If in the future our non-Guarantor subsidiaries constitute a material portion of

60


-----

our operations then our consolidated financial statements may be of limited use in assessing the results
of operations and financial position of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_The claims of the holders of the Notes are effectively subordinated to the rights of our future_**
**_secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness which does not_**
**_constitute Collateral._**

The Notes will only be secured by the Collateral. The Indenture will provide for a negative pledge but
will allow us and our restricted subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, to incur secured
indebtedness that will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the non-collateral
assets that secure that indebtedness. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization, or other insolvency or
bankruptcy proceeding, the proceeds from the sale of non-collateral assets securing any indebtedness
will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all such secured indebtedness (including
claims preferred by operation of law) has been paid in full. As a result, holders of Notes may receive
less, ratably, than holders of indebtedness secured by assets that do not constitute Collateral.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of subsidiaries
that provide Collateral or Guarantees as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, then claims under the Security Documents and the Guarantees may be
released. Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens,” “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in_
_Respect of the Permitted Senior Financing Debt, the Notes and the Transaction Security—Non-_
_distressed Disposals” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor_
_Agreement—Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Permitted Senior_
_Financing Debt, the Notes and the Transaction Security—Distressed Disposal.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees may be released and retaken in connection with certain corporate reorganizations and the
incurrence of additional secured indebtedness. In certain jurisdictions, including England and Wales
and Denmark, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening
period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency
administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant
of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of
such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to release in
connection with a distressed disposal. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Permitted_
_Senior Financing Debt, the Notes and the Transaction Security—Distressed Disposal.”_

Additionally, even though the holders of Notes will share in the Collateral with the creditors under the
New Revolving Credit Facility, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility will receive the
proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the holders of the Notes and, under certain
circumstances, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain
of our hedging obligations, if any, will control enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral
through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree with those actions. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Holders of the Notes will not_
_control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals.”_

61


-----

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes and such Collateral_**
**_may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes will be secured by security interests in the Collateral as described in this Offering
Memorandum, which Collateral will also secure our obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility (and counterparties under
certain hedging agreements, if any) will receive the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral in
priority to the holders of the Notes. Upon a refinancing of the New Revolving Credit Facility, or if the
lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement consent to an increase of the commitments
under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or if we exercise our right to incur additional
priority debt and/or hedging obligations, the amount that will benefit from super priority interests in the
Collateral may be increased, subject to the limits imposed under the Indenture, the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral may also secure additional
debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your direct and indirect rights
to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the super-priority debt secured by the
Collateral, an increase in obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, or a reduction of the
Collateral securing the Notes.

The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.
No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the
Offering. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include,
among others, our ability to implement our business strategy, whether or not the business is sold as a
going concern, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the
availability of buyers, whether any approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a
potential buyer and similar factors. Hence, the amount to be received upon a sale of any Collateral
would be dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to the actual fair market value of
the Collateral at such time, general market and economic conditions and the timing and the manner of
the sale.

There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be sellable and, even if sellable, the timing of
any liquidation or foreclosure is uncertain. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third
parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights
and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could materially adversely affect the
value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. By
the nature of our business, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Also, certain of our contracts, including the Indenture and the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, include a change of control clause, which may be triggered by
enforcement of Collateral and limit the value of the Collateral.

In the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less
than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and other senior secured
obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is
filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you
that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations
due under the Notes. If the proceeds of any enforcement (including, where applicable, a sale) of
Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the
proceeds of the sale of the Collateral), you would only have a senior unsecured claim against the Issuer’s
remaining assets.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral, such as certain pre-existing or statutory liens. Holders of such other secured
indebtedness may have rights and remedies which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to
satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes, holders of such
additional Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the Notes, thereby diluting
such holder’s ability to benefit from the Collateral.

62


-----

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer_**
**_may, at its option, redeem the Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Notes, holders of not less than 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding
Notes at a price equivalent to that paid pursuant to such purchase or tender offer. As a consequence,
you may be required to surrender the Notes against your will at a price below par, and may not receive
the return you expect to receive on the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed_**
**_disposals._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing
the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. In
addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional
indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu or on a
super priority basis relative to the Notes.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, providers of
certain additional super senior indebtedness, certain hedging obligations, if any, the Security Agent,
any receiver and certain creditor representatives, including the Trustee, are entitled to be repaid with
the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale and all amounts received by the Security
Agent pursuant to the turnover provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in priority to the Notes. As
such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able
to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super senior
indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale
of the Collateral by any creditor and all amounts received by the Security Agent pursuant to the turnover
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will, after all obligations under super senior indebtedness
have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes, any other
obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes and certain
non-priority hedging obligations, if any.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security
agent for the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the hedging obligations which are
permitted to be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the Notes and the creditors of any additional
debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement also regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to
take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i)
creditors holding in aggregate more than 66.67% of the aggregate commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, the aggregate commitments under any super senior Credit Facility and the
aggregate of hedging exposures under certain priority hedging obligations (the “Accelerating Majority
**Super Senior Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding in aggregate more than 66.67% of the outstanding**
principal amount of the Notes and the outstanding principal amount of any indebtedness ranking pari
_passu with the Notes (the “Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case, except_
for any hedge counterparties, acting through their respective creditor representative). If, however,
before the discharge of all super senior obligations, the Security Agent has received conflicting
enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives (and for these purposes, silence is deemed to
be a conflicting instruction) then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (to the extent given) comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security
enforcement principles set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement (one of which states that the primary
and overriding objective of an enforcement of security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far
as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value, of recoveries by the Super Senior

63


-----

Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (each as defined below under “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”)), the Security Agent will comply with the_
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super senior liabilities have
not been fully discharged within six months (or within three months of the first instructions of
Enforcement given to the Security Agent following any failure to pay on the maturity date of the Credit
Facility (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)), or no enforcement action has occurred
within three months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were issued, then the
instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. The New Revolving Credit Facility
will mature three months prior to the maturity of the Notes, which means that the New Revolving Credit
Facility may become due and payable during the above period. To the extent we incur additional
indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of the holders of
the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately with the amount of indebtedness we
incur.

The lenders and other creditors under our super senior indebtedness may have interests that are different
from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. Any holder of the Notes that holds an interest in
the New Revolving Credit Facility (other than (i) any of the original lenders under the New Revolving
Credit Facility and (ii) any lender that holds notes debt on a bona fide trading account and, in the case
of both (i) and (ii), that is not acting on behalf of a holder of the Notes) will be disenfranchised from
voting on the New Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any subsidiary of the Issuer
as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, against, and the liens over any
other assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes and Guarantees may
be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,”
“Description of the Notes—Guarantees—Release of Guarantee” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will, subject to the terms of the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral to the
extent it relates to their assets. So long as no enforcement event has occurred or would result therefrom,
the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, modifying or
otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the
amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of
the liens on the Collateral.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes_**
**_upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture_**
**_and the change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_**
**_protection in the event of certain important corporate events and change of control events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control” under the Indenture, the Issuer
is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that
we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide
to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New

64


-----

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may
result in the acceleration or mandatory prepayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility and other
indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default
under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive
cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence
of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may
not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of
control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase
of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent
to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes.
In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain
such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture,
which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
_Change of Control.”_

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may materially adversely affect you,
because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even
if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as defined in the Indenture).

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control if, after giving effect to such change of control, the consolidated
net leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries does not exceed a certain threshold as
defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise, established
definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be materially adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the
grantor of the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees
may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes or Guarantees if we fail or are unable to
take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests or if such perfection is not required at
all under the Security Documents or is only required after the occurrence of certain events. Any failure
to properly and timely perfect any security interest in the Collateral in accordance with applicable law
may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or the holder of the security interest having
difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

65


-----

In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general
security interest, such as real property and equipment, only be perfected at or promptly following the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified. None of the Trustee or the Security Agent has
any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the
perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.

Granting of security subject to Danish law could be set aside under Danish insolvency laws if, among
other things, (i) security for the debts was not granted to the creditor before or at the time the debt was
incurred; or (ii) security was not perfected before, or without undue delay after, the time when the debt
was incurred. These timing requirements in respect of granting of security and perfection of security
are interpreted very strictly under Danish law. In such situations, security could be set aside if it has not
been perfected no less than three months prior to the date on which the bankruptcy court receives the
petition for bankruptcy proceedings (the “reference date”) and in some cases avoidance can be claimed
even for security granted and perfected before. If the security is granted to related parties, the voidance
period is extended to two years. Voidance is a real risk in respect of Collateral subject to Danish law.
See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark.”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Danish Collateral._**

The Danish Collateral may be subject to limitations, exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture or the Security Documents, whether on or after the date
the Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Danish Collateral, as well as the ability of the
Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests
can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or re-characterization under Danish law. Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights
is determined by the date on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest
created later in time over that same collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed
prior to perfection of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have
priority.

The Danish Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of
security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party
to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consents. In
addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate an enforcement
action in respect of such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to take
enforcement action in respect of those assets, and the value of the Danish Collateral may significantly
decrease. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark.”_

**_The granting of security interests in the Danish Collateral may create hardening periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with Danish law._**

The granting of new Danish law security interests in connection with the Offering may create hardening
periods for such security interests in Denmark. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been perfected. In each instance, if
the security interest perfected were to be enforced before the end of the relevant hardening period
applicable in Denmark, such security interest may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations – Denmark.”_

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new
security interest has been perfected. At each time, if the security interest perfected were to be enforced
before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be avoided with the effect that any
preference as secured creditor will not be available. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest

66


-----

to secure future indebtedness or the transfer or the assignment of the security interest may restart or
reopen hardening periods. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such new security
is amended, transferred, assigned, granted or perfected. If the security interest granted was to be
enforced before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or
ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes,
_the Guarantees and the Collateral—Your rights in the Collateral may be materially adversely affected_
_by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.”_

**_Enforcement of the collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights
under the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult
to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings.
Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often
result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of
these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should
apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees. A summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of
the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland and certain jurisdictions where the providers of
collateral are organized or have their center of main activities are set out in “Certain Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Denmark and Switzerland may not be as favorable to_**
**_creditors, including investors in the Notes, as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which_**
**_you are familiar and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees_**
**_or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company which is incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized and existing under the laws of
England and Wales, Denmark and Switzerland. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions mentioned above. In addition, certain security
interests will be granted in favor of the Notes in England and Wales, Denmark and Switzerland. Such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may
result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the
Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions
and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of
the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post commencement interest
and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call
into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance laws and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the
Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security
interests in the Collateral. Courts may also in certain circumstances avoid the security interest or the
Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency.

67


-----

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for more information on the insolvency laws of the Issuer’s_
and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization.

In addition, the laws of certain jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of
these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Financial assistance, corporate benefit and other limitations_
_on the Danish Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Danish_
_Guarantees.”_

**_Financial assistance, corporate benefit and other limitations on the Danish Guarantees may_**
**_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Danish Guarantees._**

Danish law limits the ability of the Danish Guarantors to guarantee the Notes. These limitations
principally arise under provisions or principles of corporate law relating to (i) financial assistance and
(ii) corporate benefit considerations pursuant to which, among others, the risks associated with a
guarantee on account of a direct or indirect parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and
economically and operationally justified from the Danish Guarantor’s perspective. If these limitations
are not observed, the Guarantees by the Danish Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge.

In order for a Danish company to provide a guarantee or security in relation to another group company’s
debt, it is a general requirement under Danish law that the Danish company obtains an adequate
corporate benefit from such guarantee or security. This is related to the general duty of the board of
directors and the management board of a Danish company to act responsibly (forsvarligt) and to ensure
a proper management of the company’s assets. Further, the board of directors and the management
board must always act in the best interests of the Danish company’s individual interest. When assessing
whether it is in the Danish company’s best interest to guarantee or secure another group company’s
debt, the board of directors and the management board should consider all relevant circumstances,
including (i) the company’s financial position, capital and liquidity resources, (ii) the benefits that the
company will obtain from providing the guarantee or security, (iii) the potential risks related to
providing the guarantee or security, including an assessment of the credit rating of the principal debtor,
and (iv) securing that the arrangement is on arms’ length terms.

If sufficient corporate benefit is not obtained, among others, the guarantee or security may be null and
void. It is not clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit can be established when
a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company.

In accordance with applicable Danish law, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors will
contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed so that applicable Danish law restrictions will
not be violated. To comply with the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit
restrictions, any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form)
granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries (whether or not
incorporated in Denmark) will be deemed not to be so granted and limited if and to the extent required
to comply with the provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans
including, without limitation, as set out in Sections 206-212 of the Danish Companies Act.

In addition, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors may further be limited to a maximum
amount equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of the Relevant Guarantor (calculated in
accordance with the approved accounting principles) at the time of the granting of the Guarantees, or at
the time payment is requested pursuant to any such Guarantee granted by a Danish Guarantor. The
equity limitation applicable to the Guarantees by the Danish Guarantors will apply on an aggregate
basis with respect to any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever
form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor in respect of the Notes and the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Danish
Guarantor, your claims may be severely limited or even reduced to zero.

68


-----

In addition, the Danish Guarantors are also borrowers and/or guarantors under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement. Whilst the above-mentioned guarantee limitations are also included in the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, they may not apply to the same extent to borrowings under
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as they do to the Notes due to different application of
such borrowings and the proceeds of the Notes. Accordingly, the ability of the lenders under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to recover from the Danish Guarantors the amount of loans made
under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may be superior to the ability of the holders of the
Notes to enforce the Guarantees of any of those Danish Guarantors.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark—Limitation on Enforcement of Guarantees and_
_Security Interests” for more information on applicable Danish law which limits the ability of the Danish_
Guarantors to guarantee the Notes.

**_Financial assistance, corporate benefit and other limitations on the Swiss guarantees and collateral_**
**_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Swiss guarantees of and the collateral for_**
**_the Notes._**

The Swiss Guarantor will guarantee the payment of the Notes on a first priority basis. Each guarantee
will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the Swiss Guarantor. In addition, the
Swiss Guarantor will secure the payment of the Notes by granting collateral under the relevant Security
Documents. However, the security interest granted by a Swiss Guarantor under a Security Document
will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest,
and the Indenture governing the Notes will provide that each guarantee will be limited to the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by a Swiss Guarantor, without rendering the relevant guarantee and
security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under the laws of Switzerland, and enforcement of
such guarantee and security interest may be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, financial assistance, corporate purpose,
capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.
As a consequence of such limitation, the liability of the Swiss Guarantor may be lower than the unpaid
amounts due to the holders of the Notes or the Swiss Guarantor may have no liability at all under its
Guarantee / Security Document and the Guarantee / security interest may turn out to be of no economic
value. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Switzerland.”_

The enforcement of the Guarantee and the Security Documents against a Swiss Guarantor will be
subject to certain generally available defenses, such as corporate purpose or benefit, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, guarantees and security
interests can be challenged and a court could (i) declare unenforceable against third parties (including
the beneficiaries thereof) or void, any legal act performed by a Swiss Guarantor (including, without
limitation, the issuance by it of the guarantees or the grant of security interests under the Security
Documents), (ii) require, if payment had already been made under a guarantee or enforcement proceeds
applied under a Security Document, that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof)
return the payment to the Swiss Guarantor and (iii) take other action that is detrimental to the holders
of the Notes, if the court found, inter alia, that:

- the relevant act was performed (for example, the guarantees and/or the security interests under the
security documents were granted) with actual intent to give an impermissible preference to one
creditor over another; and/or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant security document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;
and/or

69


-----

- the Swiss Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for granting the relevant guarantee or security interests; and/or

- when granting the guarantee and/or collateral the Swiss Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became
undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee or security document; or (iii) intended to incur,
or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

- the relevant guarantee and/or security interest was incurred with actual intent to give preference to
one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors of the Swiss Guarantor.

There is no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether any payments to
holders of the Notes would be voidable on the above-listed or any other grounds. If a court set-aside or
voided a guarantee or held it unenforceable for any other reason, investors may cease to have any claim
in respect of the Swiss Guarantor and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and of a Swiss Guarantor
under a guarantee that has not been declared void. In all such events, the Notes would be structurally
subordinated to all (other) liabilities of the relevant Guarantor.

**_Security over the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_laws._**

The security interests in the collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent.

Under certain applicable laws, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other
than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. In order to
permit the holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Security Agent will have the benefit
of so-called parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the
“Principal Obligations”). The security documents governed by the laws of the Switzerland will
directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel
Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations.
Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and
any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations.
The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents and those
holders of the notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests
except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security
interests in the collateral). As a result, the holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In Switzerland, there is no statutory law or case law
available on the validity or enforceability of the parallel debt construct or the security provided for such
parallel debt. However, notwithstanding this uncertainty, we have been advised that there are no reasons
why the Parallel Debt will not create a claim of the pledgee (the Security Agent) thereunder which can
be validly secured by security interests. To the extent the Parallel Debt construct would be successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of
the security interests in the collateral in the relevant jurisdiction. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_The ability of the Security Agent to hold the relevant security interests over the Danish Collateral_**
**_on behalf of holders of Notes pursuant to any security document governed by Danish law as well as_**
**_the ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of holders of Notes may require registration_**

70


-----

**_of the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority_**
**_(Finanstilsynet)._**

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to
represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of
the relevant company having granted the Danish Collateral; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security
Agent have and will maintain the capacity to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on
behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of bankruptcy of the relevant company having granted the
Danish Collateral; (iii) whether the security and guarantees can be validly granted in favor of the
Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether the
holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently. As regards the
Notes, a guarantee issued by a Danish Guarantor and any security document expressed to be governed
by Danish law, the above concerns regarding the ability of the Security Agent to hold a guarantee and
the relevant security interests over Collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the ability of the
Trustee to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes can be addressed by registering the
Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with the
rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act (Consolidated Act No. 41 of
13 January 2023 as amended, kapitalmarkedsloven). No assurance is given that the Security Agent, the
Trustee or the Indenture and other documents meet the eligibility criteria for the Security Agent and/or
the Trustee to be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that such registration will
be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be maintained.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are companies incorporated outside the United States. All of our directors
and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of
the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain
New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on our directors and executive officers or the directors and
executive officers of the Guarantors. In addition, as all of our assets and those of our directors and
executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities
laws of the United States. In addition, we cannot assure you that an English court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action were commenced in England and Wales
instead of the United States, predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws or other laws. See
“Limitations on Validity of Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of
any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United
States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other
jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the
Notes or conduct an exchange offer for registered notes, and do not have any intention to do so. It is the
obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their purchase and any subsequent transfer of the Notes
within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes or may have limited liquidity._**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or
the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the

71


-----

market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be materially adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is
subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract
different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the
market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on
you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there
is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application is expected to be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the “Exchange”), the Notes may not become or remain listed. Although no assurance is
made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Official List of the
Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission
to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a
material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future, which could materially
adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.

We have been informed by the Initial Purchasers that they intend to make a market for the Notes after
the Offering is completed. Nevertheless, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so and may cease
their market making activity at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will
be subject to limitations imposed by the Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a
result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if one does
develop, that it will be maintained.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may materially adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
materially adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Euro Notes offered hereby are denominated and payable in euros and the Sterling Notes offered
hereby are denominated and payable in pounds sterling. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros, with respect to the Euro Notes, or pounds sterling, with respect
to the Sterling Notes, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange risks related to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the pound sterling relative to the currency by
reference to which you measure the return on your investments because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro or pound sterling, as applicable, against
the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments could cause a decrease
in the effective yield of the applicable series of Notes, below the stated coupon rate and could result in
a loss to you when the return on the Notes, as applicable, is translated into the currency by reference to
which you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax consequences for you as a result
of any foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from an investment in the Notes.

72


-----

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book entry interests in the Notes (which
will only occur in very limited circumstances), owners of the book entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes in global form. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be made to the Principal
Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, such payments will
be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the
Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary, we and the Trustee will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of
interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a
book entry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of
the Notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right
to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes, including enforcement of security for the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be reliant on the common depositary (as registered holder of the Notes) to act on your instructions
and/or will be permitted to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do
so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any
requested actions or to take any other action on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures
to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the Notes.

**_The interests of our sponsors may conflict with the interests of the holders of Notes._**

The interests of each of our sponsors may, in certain circumstances, conflict with your interests as a
holder of Notes. Our sponsors and their respective affiliates control the Issuer. As a result, they each
have, and will continue to have, the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure
and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve
other changes to our operations. Either of our sponsors may also have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their respective judgment, will
enhance their respective equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a
holder of Notes. For example, our sponsors could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to
sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case so long as the Indenture so permits. The
incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain
assets could reduce our ability to generate sales, each of which could adversely affect you as a holder
of Notes. In addition, either of our sponsors may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete
with ours or do business with us.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early you may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives_
proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable
security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

73

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited or no recourse against the independent auditors._**

In respect of the auditors’ reports relating to our consolidated financial statements reproduced herein,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent auditors, states the following: “This report, including
_the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with_
_Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these_
_opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this_
_report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in_
_writing.”_

Investors in the Notes should understand that, in making these statements, the independent auditor
confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes)
other than us with respect to the report and to the independent auditor’s audit work and opinion. The
SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus
used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or in a report
filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language
quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based
on their report or the combined and consolidated financial information to which they relate could be
limited.

_Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not presented and therefore the_
information shown here reflects that originally reported. Had the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 been
presented on a restated basis, the revenue for the year would be £0.1 million lower, other administrative expenses £2.7 million higher
(due to associated impairment charges) and the resulting loss for the period would be £2.8 million higher than those presented above.

**Overview**

We are the second largest gym and fitness operator in Europe by number of gyms, with over 550 sites
and approximately 1.9 million members across our estate. We provide high quality, low cost, flexible
physical fitness facilities and have market leading positions in each of our three key markets: the UK,
Denmark and Switzerland.

Our operating model provides a powerful customer proposition that is differentiated from traditional
gym operators and appeals to a broad range of consumers. The key elements of our model proposition
include affordable membership fees, flexible contracts, a large footprint in each of our key markets and
24/7 access (in most locations) to high-quality gyms. This proposition is underpinned by the
differentiated, capital-efficient and technology-enabled gym operating model, which enables us to
support high levels of membership, operate on low costs and generate strong unit economics, cash flow
conversion and ROCE, and provides us with a strong platform for expansion.

Our strategic mission is to be a leading provider of affordable and flexible fitness memberships to
high-quality fitness facilities in current and new markets. Our customer value proposition, differentiated
business model and well-managed growth strategy has allowed us to grow rapidly in multiple
geographies through new site roll-outs, acquisitions and membership expansion. We are the largest
operator of gyms in the UK both by number of gyms and members. Following our acquisition of the
Fitness World Group in 2020, we also became the leading operator in Denmark by number of gyms and
members and the leading value gym operator in Switzerland by number of gyms and members. In 2021,
we launched a franchise model with the first franchised sites opening in the Middle East, which has
allowed us to bring our affordable, accessible gym proposition to a number of exciting new markets
and provides a platform for expanding our franchised offering to other territories in the future. In 2022,
we also opened our first three corporate-owned gyms in the U.S. with over 11,000 members as of
June 30, 2023.

81


-----

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenue of £515.3 million and a Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA of £128.4 million, an increase of 14% and 19%, respectively, from the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

**Significant factors affecting our results of operations**

This section discusses key factors that we believe have had a material effect on our results of operations
and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to
have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition in the future.

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

Our results in 2020 and 2021 were particularly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on our operations.

Prior to the impact that the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic had on our financial performance in the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had a strong start to the 2020 financial year. In addition
to our acquisition of Fitness World, we had a strong trading performance in January and February and
membership numbers peaked at 1.9 million as of February 29, 2020. However, in March 2020, the
governments of the countries in which we operate imposed significant lockdown measures in order to
control its spread and, in doing so, required the temporary closures of all our gyms through various
lockdown periods until restrictions were lifted in April 2021. Throughout all lockdown periods, our
overall approach was to place members on “free freeze” and as a result almost all of our revenues
ceased. Some revenues were received during the initial closure period in Denmark as a result of offers
made to members and, in the UK, a small amount of revenue was secured from ancillary products.
However, in aggregate, almost all of our revenue effectively ceased until the phased reopenings of our
gyms began. We had a strong year in 2019 and a robust start to 2020, both of which enabled us to enter
the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial strength; however, the spread of COVID-19 and the
prolonged and unprecedented shutdown of our gym estate had a material negative impact on our
business.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we suffered a £172 million (39%) drop in revenue compared to
the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a combined basis assuming Fitness World had been acquired on
January 1, 2019 (excluding Fitness World Poland), the “2019 Adjusted Combined Basis” ), with our
gyms closed for approximately 37% of trading days in the year.

In an effort to mitigate business risk during the COVID-19 period and cope with the damage caused to
our business, we placed a large focus on cash management efforts, including utilizing government aid
and mitigation programs and successfully structuring a deal with our shareholders to recapitalize our
business. In September 2020, we received a £100.7 million equity injection from our stakeholders and
also obtained an increase of £50 million in available facilities under our Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility. In combination with the equity injection, this provided us with an additional
£150 million of liquidity headroom and a strong financial platform from which to rebuild our business
(the “Recapitalization”). Additionally, in March 2021, we raised a further €45 million of Existing Euro
Notes to replace cash spent during the lockdown closures in the first quarter of 2021.

Despite strong cost reduction initiatives and £48.2 million of government support across the Group, we
saw a net cash outflow of £62.7 million in 2020 (before factoring in the £100.7 million Equity Injection),
and we finished the year with over £37 million of deferred payments due to third parties.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenue increased to £302.4 million compared to £269.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2020, with our gyms closed for approximately 30% of trading
days in the year. Net cash outflow was £96.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 (before
factoring in a £38.8 million cash inflow from the issuance of €45 million of additional Existing Euro
Notes in March 2021) and deferred payments due to third parties decreased to £27 million. As at the
date of this Offering Memorandum, all COVID-19 deferments and associated landlord negotiations
have been settled.

For more information about the risks associated with the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics or
other macroeconomic turmoil on our ability to minimize cash burn, see “Risk Factors—Risks relating
_to our business—The effect of any future pandemics could materially negatively impact the operations_
_of our business and, therefore, our financial position, due to many factors, some of which are beyond_
_our control,” “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—Economic factors or a change in_
_consumer preferences and discretionary spending, which are uncertain and largely beyond our control,_
_could negatively impact our membership figures, which could adversely affect our revenue” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks relating to our business—We may be forced to close gyms temporarily or other adverse_
_consequences could result due to unforeseen circumstances.”_

Despite the significant impact of government mandated lockdowns on our day-to-day operations, our
business returned to profitability in May 2021 following the reopening of our estate. In December 2021,
we agreed a £300 million equity investment from global investment firm, KKR, which completed in
January 2022 and materially increased the Group’s available liquidity. For the year ended December
31, 2022, revenue was £476.4 million compared to £302.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2021. In addition to no loss of revenue due to government mandated site closures relating to COVID19, this change was also due to increases in the average revenue per member resulting from measured
price increases in existing gyms, an increase in members from 1.5 million in 2021 to 1.7 million in 2022
and the opening of 45 new corporate-owned gyms in year ended December 31, 2022.

As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our revenue was £515.3 million, an increase of
17% compared to revenue of £442.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (on 2019 Adjusted
Combined Basis). Group membership stands at 1.9 million members as of June 30, 2023, an increase
of over 9% compared to the closing members of 1.7 million as of December 31, 2019 (on a 2019
Adjusted Combined Basis). In the UK, like-for-like revenue in the month ended June 30, 2023 was
101% as compared to the same period in 2019, while like-for-like membership numbers were only 87%
for the same comparative period. This was primarily due to yield improvements.

While the trends observed in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 demonstrated our resilience
at that point in time, there can be no assurance that our recovery following any future pandemics or
macroeconomic turmoil would be comparably robust. The effect of any future pandemics or
macroeconomic turmoil on our business and the wider fitness industry will ultimately depend on a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length
of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to
resume. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively implement cost
reduction initiatives or receive government aid or support from our stakeholders, in the future. For
additional detail, see “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—The effect of any future pandemics
_could materially negatively impact the operations of our business and, therefore, our financial position,_
_due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control,” “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our_
_business—Economic factors or a change in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, which_
_are uncertain and largely beyond our control, could negatively impact our membership figures, which_
_could adversely affect our revenue” and “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—We may be_
_forced to close gyms temporarily or other adverse consequences could result due to unforeseen_
_circumstances.”_

**_Roll out of new gyms_**

New gym openings have been a significant driver of our growth during the periods under review and
our roll out strategy has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant effect on our results of
operations. We opened 18 new corporate-owned gyms in 2020, 25 in 2021, 45 in 2022 and 22 in the six
months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, in January 2020, the Group’s estate increased by 222 gyms
as a result of the Fitness World acquisition (excluding 17 sites in Poland, subsequently sold in December
2020).

83


-----

The charts below show the performance of new UK site openings since January 2022, with member
numbers ramping up ahead of our pre-COVID-19 year three target.

_Source: Management data._

**_Pre-opening period_**

Prior to opening, each new corporate-owned gym typically undergoes a two to three-month long
pre-opening period following commencement of the lease. During this period, construction of the gym
is completed, a significant amount of marketing is conducted and discounted membership offers are
typically made to attract new members. Pre-Opening Costs were £3.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared to £1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and largely
consisted of staff costs and marketing expenses. The increase was partly due to the increased number
of new corporate-owned gyms opened in each period, but also due to the fact that some new gyms were
prevented from opening for longer periods than normal due to the impact of COVID-19.

Pre-Opening Costs were £4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to £3.3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to the increased number of new
corporate-owned gym openings in 2022 which was 45 compared to 25 in 2021. Pre-Opening Costs were
£2.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to £2.0 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increased number of new corporate-owned gym
openings in the six months ended June 30, 2023 which was 22 compared to 17 in the six months ended
June 30, 2022.

Average Pre-Opening Cost per UK site for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £102,000 and for
the six months ended June 30, 2023 was £91,000. These are slightly higher than the typical pre-opening
cost expected for a new UK site of approximately £74,000 due to one off delays at a small number of
sites during those periods.

**_Maturity profile_**

Once a new corporate-owned gym opens, our membership base generally increases rapidly in the first
three to six months eventually reaching mature levels after approximately 24 months.

Revenue per member also increases as members who join post-opening typically pay higher monthly
membership fees than those on pre-opening offers. Growth in revenue per member is also supported by
the expiration of pre-opening offers, which generally terminate between three and 12 months after
opening, when members who remain on these offers receive an automatic price uplift. Together, these
factors typically drive increases in revenue and result in growth in Gym Site Adjusted EBITDA as a
significant proportion of gym operating and property costs are fixed.

We defined a Mature Gym as a corporate-owned gym that has been open for two full financial years or
more as at the reporting date. We ordinarily consider a gym as a mature gym at the end of its second
year of operation, as a gym’s EBITDA tends to be substantially mature after 24 months, whereas during
the first 24 months we usually see an increase in a gym’s EBITDA. Typically, a gym’s third year is the
first full year during which it delivers annual Gym EBITDA of a mature level. For example, we consider
a gym that opened in August 2020 a Mature Gym for the year ended December 31, 2022, although its
EBITDA only tends to stabilize after August 2022, and, therefore, accordingly, the period from January
1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 would be the first full financial year during which that gym delivers an
annual Gym EBITDA of a mature level.

The following table shows selected financial information for our UK Mature Gym portfolio for the year
ended December 31, 2022. For information regarding the calculation of these items, see “Presentation
_of Financial and Other Data—Non-IFRS Measures.”_

85


-----

(4) We define Mature Gym ROCE as Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA for a certain portfolio of gyms for a certain period divided by the
Initial Capital Investment attributable to that portfolio of gyms.

**_Initial Capital Investment_**

We incur capital costs to construct and fit out new corporate-owned gyms. For the year ended December
31, 2022 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Average Initial Capital Investment for
corporate-owned gyms in UK (both Mature Gyms and New Gyms) was £1.2 million.

**_Membership volumes_**

We derive substantially all of our revenue from monthly membership fees and joining fees paid by our
members. Membership fees and joining fees represented 90.4% of our total revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2020, 88.8% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, 89.1% of our
total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 89.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.
Accordingly, our revenue is significantly dependent on membership volumes. Membership volumes are
generally affected by numerous factors, including the total number of gyms in operation, the prices the
gyms charge, the sizes and locations of our gyms, competitive dynamics in the value gym market and
seasonality, amongst others. In 2020 and 2021, our membership was significantly impacted by the
lockdowns imposed as a result of COVID-19. See “—Impact of COVID-19.”

Our membership has grown substantially over the six-month period ending June 30, 2023, with closing
membership standing at approximately 1,855,000 members, compared to 1,451,000 members,
1,535,000 members and 1,665,000 members, as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
The increase was driven by the steady recovery in volume in the core estate following the lifting of
lockdown restrictions in May 2021, the maturation of existing New Gyms and new sites opened in the
period.

**_Membership pricing_**

In addition to volume, our revenue is also dependent on the prices we charge. We operate a dynamic
pricing model with the objective of maximizing each site’s revenue. To this end, membership fee and
joining fee rates are set on an individual gym basis and take into account a number of factors such as a
gym’s membership level, its utilization profile, its capacity, the demographic profile of its local
catchment and the degree of local competition, amongst others.

Average Revenue per Member per Month for the Group was £24.61 for the six months ended June 30,
2023 compared to £23.84, £16.51 and £13.98 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,
respectively. In 2020 and 2021, growth was primarily as a result of the impact of site closures due to
COVID-19, while in 2022 and 2023, the growth was primarily driven by price progression.

**_Danish transformation plan_**

In connection with the integration and rebrand of our Danish sites to our core PureGym business model,
we implemented a strategic transformation plan with a commercial focus on active revenue and yield
management. We believe that our performance metrics demonstrate that PureGym has developed the
leading operating model, which is, and we believe in the future will continue to be, a significant driver
of growth in our Danish segment.

In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022, we operated 179, 174, and 169 sites in Denmark,
respectively, and in the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 we operated 169 and 168 sites in
Denmark. This reduction in sites is a key component of our Danish estate optimization strategy, in
which the Danish estate is being consolidated to provide a higher quality and more profitable estate that
is sustainable into the future. In the majority of cases, such site consolidation is not expected to result
in significant loss of members, as members will be transferred to neighboring PureGym sites.

86


-----

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, revenue in Denmark increased by 7.2% when compared to
revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by a price increase
in January 2023 combined with the incorporation of our leading PureGym operating model.

Following comprehensive analysis of our sites across Denmark, we expect to further optimize our estate
to between 130 and 140 sites, which we believe will lead to reduced costs, higher Average Revenue Per
Member and increased EBITDA in the future.

**_Operating Costs_**

_Low-cost gym operating model_

We employ a low-cost, technology-enabled gym operating model, which enables us to offer a
compelling customer value proposition while simultaneously delivering strong operating margins and
profitability.

The majority of site operating costs are controlled centrally within each geography and senior
management is focused on leveraging scale and implementing other initiatives to control costs and
improve efficiencies. Within each geography, site operating costs, other than property costs, are
generally consistent across all of our gyms within that geography and do not typically vary significantly
between sites. Accordingly, site operating costs as a percentage of revenue for a Mature Gym are
substantially lower than for a New Gym.

Our low-cost gym, technology-enabled operating model benefits from having low personnel costs,
property and space flexibility, low energy intensity, pricing sophistication, purchasing scale, the ability
to invest, high brand awareness and leading marketing expertise. See “Business—Strategy—Continue
_to lead in technology, innovation and operational excellence.”_

Site operating costs for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of £175.9 million have increased from
£151.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This reflects the increased number of gyms in
the estate, combined with an average inflationary uplift of approximately 5%.

Site operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 of £312.8 million have increased from £213.9
million and £220.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These
increases are due in part to the increased number of gyms in the estate, combined with the above 0.5%
inflationary increase, but also due to 2020 and 2021 both being severely impacted by the COVID-19
lockdown periods, during which management took action to minimize costs incurred to the business
whilst closed and the Group benefited from various government COVID-19 support packages,
including the furlough scheme in the UK and the fixed cost compensation scheme in Denmark.

See “Business—Strategy—Continue to lead in technology, innovation and operational excellence.”

_Head Office Costs_

We have made substantial investments in Head Office Costs over recent years to facilitate continued
innovation and differentiation, to gain more control over certain key business functions, such as IT, and
to deliver the management and technology infrastructure to support our enlarged estate and future
growth plans. These investments have included hiring additional staff as well as making investments in
management processes and IT systems to build and maintain an industry-leading technology platform.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, head office costs were £68.5 million, an increase from £54.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and from £38.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2020. These increases are due in part to the investments detailed above, but also due to 2020 and 2021
both being severely impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown periods, during which management took
action to minimize costs incurred to the business whilst closed and the Group benefited from various
government COVID-19 support packages, including the furlough scheme in the UK and the fixed cost
compensation scheme in Denmark.

87


-----

**_Seasonality_**

We experience a small degree of seasonality. The majority of our membership growth takes place in
January, February, September and October. Seasonality is generally positively driven by consumers’
desire to improve their fitness at the start of the year and the start of new university/school terms, and
negatively driven by Christmas and summer holidays. We generally focus our marketing spend around
peak joining periods, particularly during the January/February period.

**_Tax_**

We recognize expected tax liabilities based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires
significant judgment as to the ultimate tax treatment of certain items. Following recent losses endured
as a result of COVID-19, we recorded income tax credits of £20.8 million, £19.7 million and £34.0
million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In the six-month
period to June 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of £0.4 million due to the expected utilization
of deferred tax assets in the period.

**Significant factors affecting comparability of our results of operations**

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain financial and other operating data as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to its usefulness as regards its historical performance, this
data represents the ordinary course operations of our business before the impact of COVID 19 and the
acquisition of Fitness World in January 2020 (unless otherwise stated, on a 2019 Adjusted Combined
Basis).

We have also presented financial and other operating data as of and for years ended December 31, 2020
and 2021, which represent the impact on our business of the acquisition of Fitness World and COVID
19. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations in 2020 and 2021 will differ when
compared to the other historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this
discussion. Furthermore, we have also presented financial and other operating data as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and as of and for
the six months ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which represents a return to ordinary course of
operations in our business after the impact of COVID-19 for most of our results of operation.

See “—Significant factors affecting our results of operations—Impact of COVID-19.”

**_Acquisitions and Divestments_**

_Acquisitions_

Organic growth is the bedrock of our growth strategy, with acquisitions considered only when there is
a clear strategic rationale and a high level of confidence in being earnings accretive within
approximately two years. M&A activity has had a positive effect on our results of operations, which is
evidenced by our acquisition of LA Fitness in 2015 (net 31 sites acquired) and Soho Gyms in 2018 (net
9 sites acquired). In both instances, we have seen significant value creation and performance uplifts.

On January 14, 2020, we also acquired Fitness World’s 239 gym estate spanning across Denmark,
Switzerland and Poland, for a consideration of DKK 2,037.1 million (£233.4 million), and the
repayment of DKK 1,033.1 million (£118.0 million) of outstanding Fitness World indebtedness. We
acquired Fitness World because it was a strong business with very similar characteristics to PureGym.
The Fitness World Acquisition provided us with a number of operational, financial and strategic
benefits, such as increased scale in procurement, greater scale and diversification, including a stable
cash generating business with opportunities for further expansion and critical mass in international
activities.

88


-----

Due to COVID-19, full integration, consolidation and management coordination was largely halted for
two years. However, following this period, we resumed the integration and coordination of the
businesses. Further work is underway to restore and drive forward the performance and profitability of
the acquired Danish and Swiss businesses and this is a key focus for management.

The financial data of the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 presented herein include
Fitness World from its date of acquisition, January 14, 2020.

_Divestments_

On December 15, 2020, the Polish subsidiary, Fitness World sp. z o. o. (acquired in January 2020 as
part of the Fitness World Group) (“Fitness World Poland”) was sold following a strategic decision to
withdraw from the Polish market. The exit from Poland in late 2020 had no material impact on the
Group, and it was not significant in terms of either revenue or profits. The results of Fitness World
Poland are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Certain restatements and reclassifications_**

As at and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June, 30 2022,
certain amounts in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated
statement of financial position presented in this Offering Memorandum have been restated and are
derived from the 2022 Financial Statements and Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements, respectively.

Certain line items for these periods were restated to correct for computational errors associated with
revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. In line with the IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020
was not presented and therefore the information shown here reflects that originally reported. Had the
income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 been presented on a restated basis, the revenue
for the year would be £0.1 million lower, other administrative expenses £2.7 million higher (due to
associated impairment charges) and the resulting loss for the period would be £2.8 million higher than
those presented above.

For further information see note 30 of our 2022 Financial Statements and note 15 of our Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Correction of Errors” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Any failure or weakness in our internal controls could_
_materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.”_

**Description of key income statement items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue primarily comprises monthly membership fees paid by members, including fees paid by
members who freeze their memberships, additional fees for value-add options, such as premium
membership options and non-refundable joining fees paid by new members in the period. Monthly
membership fees are recognized evenly over the month on a daily basis with deferred revenue recorded
at the month end for any revenue that is to be recognized in the following month. Joining fees are
recognized in the month of receipt, with the exception of joining fees received from members who sign
up during the pre-opening period of a new gym, which are recognized as revenue in the month the
relevant gym opens. We also generate revenue from day-pass sales, vending sales, marketing
contributions from suppliers, direct debit bounce fees, rent from personal trainers and other ancillary
activities. Revenue is stated excluding value added tax and other sales-related taxes.

89


-----

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales represents the cost arising in connection with the generation of revenue from the “vending
and consumables income” and “other revenue” revenue streams, including the cost of inventories sold.

**_Other administrative expenses_**

Other administrative expenses comprise the costs incurred in administering our operations, including
employee costs, marketing costs, property costs, other operating costs, head office costs, depreciation
and impairment of property, plant and equipment and amortization and impairment of intangible assets.
Gains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are also included in other administrative
expenses. Employee costs consist of wages and salaries, social security and pension costs. Marketing
costs comprise expenditure relating to attracting new members and retaining existing members.
Property costs include rates, services charges, and other costs related to property but exclude property
lease rental costs as these are no longer accounted for within Other administrative expenses under IFRS
16, _Leases. Under IFRS 16 Leases, property lease costs now feature in the Income statement as_
depreciation charged on right of use assets and finance charges, on the unwind of the discounted lease
liabilities. Other operating costs comprise repairs, maintenance, cleaning, insurance, security, utilities
expenses and other costs.

Head office costs comprise costs that are not allocated to our gyms and are generally incurred in
administrating our estate and our business, including central and regional support staff costs and their
associated administration costs, technology and website maintenance costs, professional fees and other
costs. The largest component of head office costs is employee costs.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment relates to depreciation of fixtures and fittings, leasehold
improvements, fitness equipment and right of use assets. Capital costs are depreciated over six years
for fixtures, fittings and fitness equipment, three to fifteen years for leasehold improvements and the
life of the lease for leasehold costs and right of use assets. Initial Capital Investment is generally
depreciated over a blended average useful life of nine years while refurbishment capital spend is
generally depreciated over a blended average useful life of six years. Amortization includes
amortization of intangible assets.

**_Exceptional administrative expenses_**

Exceptional administrative expenses include items that are material in size and unusual or infrequent in
nature, such as one-off costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the exploration of a capital raising or
expansion opportunity and restructuring costs incurred in relation to a reset of the Danish head office
cost base. The separate reporting of exceptional administrative expenses helps provide an indication of
our underlying performance.

**_Net finance costs_**

Net finance costs are finance costs net of finance income. Finance costs represent the interest and
charges (accrued or paid) associated with bank loans and overdrafts under the Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes, the preference shares, finance leases, foreign exchange
losses, amortization of any fees associated with the raising of finance that have been capitalized and
costs associated with the unwinding of property lease liabilities on a post-IFRS 16 basis, which are
recognized using the effective interest method.

Finance income consists of interest (accrued or paid) on cash held at the bank, income from IFRS 16
sub-leases and additionally, exceptional non-cash finance income arising upon the refinancing of our
bridge facility (entered into in connection with the Fitness World acquisition in January 2020) with the
issuance of our Existing Euro Notes in November 2020.

90


-----

**_Income tax (charge)/credit_**

Income tax (charge)/credit comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable
or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax
assets are recognized for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

(1) In the 2022 Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, certain line items for the
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022 were restated to correct for computational errors
associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. In line with the IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not presented and therefore the_
information shown here reflects that originally reported. Had the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 been
presented on a restated basis, the revenue for the year would be £0.1 million lower, other administrative expenses £2.7 million higher
(due to associated impairment charges) and the resulting loss for the period would be £2.8 million higher than those presented above.
For further information see note 30 of our 2022 Financial Statements and note 15 of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial

**_Results of operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 and 2022_**

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by 16.7% to £271.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to
£232.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. In the UK, revenue increased by 18.0% to
£178.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to £151.4 million for the six months

91


-----

ended June 30, 2022. In Denmark, revenue increased by 7.2% to £71.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2023 as compared to £66.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. In Switzerland,
revenue increased by 31.7% to £18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to
£14.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The increase in revenue in the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 from the six-month period ended
June 30, 2022 was due to a combination of an 11.4% increase in members, a 5.0% increase in the
average revenue per member resulting from measured price increases in existing gyms, the maturation
of existing new gyms and the opening of 50 new corporate owned gyms in the period from July 1, 2022
to June 30, 2023.

_Other administrative expenses_

The table below presents a breakdown of other administrative expenses for the six months ended June
30, 2022 and 2023.

(1) In the financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2022, certain line items for the six months ended June 30, 2022
were restated to correct for computational errors associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. For further information
see note 15 of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Correction of Errors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Any
_failure or weakness in our internal controls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.”_

Other administrative expenses increased by 12.1% to £222.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2023 as compared to £198.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in number of corporate-owned gym sites, an average inflationary uplift of
approximately 5% in our operating cost base and investments in head office in preparation for the next
phase of growth in the business.

_Exceptional administrative expenses_

Exceptional administrative expenses of £1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily
related to the rebrand of our Danish estate. There were no exceptional administrative expenses for the
six months ended June 30, 2022.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs decreased to £65.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of £8.0
million, or 10.8%, as compared to £73.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. This decrease
was primarily due to receiving interest income on cash deposits of £3.8 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2023 combined with £4.6 million of foreign exchange gain in relation to our Existing
Euro Notes and Danish-Krone denominated intercompany loans, which act as a partial natural hedge
against the value of our non-UK subsidiaries.

_Income tax credit/(charge)_

As of June 30, 2023, we recorded income tax expense of £0.4 million due to the expected utilization of
deferred tax assets in the period, compared to an income tax credit of £4.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022.

**_Results of operations for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021_**

_Revenue_

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £476.4 million compared to £302.4 million in the
year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to a combination of factors including:
lost revenue during 2021 due to COVID-19 lockdowns, during which we were closed for 30% of trading
days in the year; steady recovery of the membership in our core estate since reopening post-COVID19; the maturation of existing immature gyms, the opening of 45 new corporate-owned gyms in year
ended December 31, 2022 and an increase in the average revenue per member resulting from measured
price increases in existing gyms.

_Other administrative expenses_

The table below presents a breakdown of other administrative expenses for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021.

**For the year ended December 31,**

**Other Administrative expenses .............................................................** **333.5** **459.2**

(1) In the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, certain line items for the year ended December 31, 2021
were restated to correct for computational errors associated with revenue recognition in our Swiss business unit. For further information
see note 30 of our 2022 Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Correction of Errors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Any failure or weakness in our internal_
_controls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.”_

Other administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £459.2 million, an increase
of £125.7 million, or 37.7%, compared to £333.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This
increase was due a number of factors including: 2021 being severely impacted by the covid closure
periods, during which management took action to minimize costs incurred to the business whilst closed
and the Group benefited from various government covid support packages, including the furlough
scheme in the UK and the fixed cost compensation scheme in Denmark; an increase in number of
corporate-owned gym sites and in addition, there was an increase in impairment losses from £16 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to £45 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including
£23 million charged in relation to the rebrand of our Danish estate.

93


-----

_Exceptional administrative expenses_

Exceptional administrative income for the year ended December 31, 2022 of £1.0 million primarily
related to the recognition of £1.0 million of recoverable VAT income related to exceptional expenses
incurred in previous years originally assumed to be non-recoverable for VAT purposes.

Exceptional administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 of £6.9 million primarily
related to the exploration of a number of capital raising opportunities, restructuring costs incurred in
relation to a reset of the Danish head office cost base and the exploration of expansion opportunities in
the United States, offset by the settlement of a break lease at one of our sites.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £151.1 million, an increase of £24.7
million, or 19.6%, compared to £126.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was
as a result of foreign exchange losses incurred from our Euro-denominated borrowings, combined with
interest accruing on intercompany borrowings from parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited.

_Income tax credit/(charge)_

Income tax was a credit of £34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of £14.3
million as compared to a credit of £19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The tax credits
arose in respect of losses in previous years due to COVID-19 closures.

**_Results of operations for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020_**

_Revenue_

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £302.4 million, an increase of £32.6 million, or
12.1%, compared to £269.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue was materially
impacted by the closure of our gyms at various times across both 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19.
Overall, our gyms were closed for 30% of trading days in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared
to 37% in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase in trading days, combined with the opening
of 25 new corporate-owned gyms in year ended December 31, 2021 led to the increase in revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Other administrative expenses_

_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the restated income statement for the year ended December 31,_

94


-----

2020 was not presented and therefore the information shown here reflects that originally reported. Had the income statement for the
year ended December 31, 2020 been presented on a restated basis then Other Administrative expenses would have been £2.7 million
higher (due to associated impairment charges) than shown above. For further information see note 30 of our 2022 Financial Statements,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Correction of Errors” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Any failure or weakness in our internal controls could materially and adversely affect our_
_financial condition and results of operation.”_

Other administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were £333.5 million, a decrease
of £8.8 million, or 2.6%, compared to £342.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other
administration expenses for 2020 and 2021 were severely impacted by the COVID-19 lockdowns,
during which management took action to minimize costs incurred to the business whilst closed and the
Group benefited from various government COVID-19 support packages, including the furlough scheme
in the UK and the fixed cost compensation scheme in Denmark, however in overall terms, the decrease
was principally the result of impairment losses incurred in 2020 in relation to both the rebrand of our
Swiss operations and the impact of the COVID-19 gym closures.

_Exceptional administrative expenses_

Exceptional administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were £6.9 million, an
increase of £3.1 million compared to £3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Exceptional
administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to the restructuring
certain operations of the existing business and exploration of other acquisition and expansion
opportunities, while exceptional administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020
primarily related to the integration of our Danish and Swiss operations, restructuring projects and one
off costs incurred in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by £5.0 million of proceeds
received by way of settlement for the break of a lease at one of the UK sites.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were £126.4 million, a decrease of £2.1 million,
or 1.6%, compared to £128.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
a result of foreign exchange gains from euro-denominated borrowings, as well as costs associated with
borrowing facilities.

_Income tax credit_

Income tax credit for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £19.7 million compared to £20.8 million
in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Liquidity and capital resources_

Liquidity requirements arise primarily from the need to fund the Group’s roll out strategy, make interest
payments on indebtedness, fund working capital requirements and invest in the upkeep of existing
gyms, central systems and capabilities. The Group’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow
from operating activities, equity injections from our stakeholders and credit facilities, including £145
million available under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility, which includes a £10
million overdraft facility and will be cancelled (and replaced) in connection with this Offering.
Following the Offering, the Group’s working and capital expenditure requirements are expected to be
funded with future cash flow from operating activities and cash holdings and, if necessary,
£175.5 million available under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

As of June 30, 2023, the Group had £180.3 million cash and cash equivalents and £145 million in the
undrawn Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility commitments available for drawing by way
of certain ancillary facilities, including a £10 million available overdraft facility.

**period ......................................................** **91.1** **31.9** **204.6** **254.8** **180.3**

_Net cash flows generated from/(used in) from operating activities_

Net cash flows from/(used in) operating activities comprise operating profit before interest, tax,
profit/(loss) on disposals, depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, net of the movement in
net working capital and less tax, exceptional costs paid, net interest and debt issuance costs paid.

Net cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was an inflow of £61.0
million, an increase of £35.2 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 as the growth
in revenue and operating profit set out above readily converts into cash.

Net cash flow generated from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £60.0
million, an increase of £68.5 million, compared to £8.5 million used in operating activities in the year
ended December 31, 2021. In 2021, operating cash flows of the Group were significantly reduced due
to COVID-19. Membership subscriptions were frozen during the closure period in 2021 severely
impacting cash generated from operations, but this loss of cash flow was offset in part by government
mitigation schemes combined with swift management action to reduce costs and preserve cash. In 2022,
with all of its gyms re-opened, members returning and revenue reverting to a trajectory of growth, the
Group has quickly returned to a cash generative state.

Net cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £8.5 million
compared to £18.0 million used in the year ended December 31, 2020. Negative cash flows in these
periods were as a direct result of COVID-19 lockdowns, as discussed above.

_Net cash flows used in investing activities_

Net cash flows used in investing activities consist of expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets and amounts paid for acquisitions, less proceeds from disposals and the portion of any
capital expenditure funded through finance leases.

Net cash outflow from investing activities was £51.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, as
compared to £34.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. In both periods, this outflow primarily
related to investment in new site development and refurbishment of the existing estate.

Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £87.7 million,
compared to the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 of

96


-----

£47.4 million. The increase related to the higher number of new site openings and refurbishment activity
during 2022.

Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were £271.2 million,
which primarily related to the acquisition of Fitness World, net of cash acquired (£226.4 million) and
purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of £47.1 million (including £0.8
million of net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operation, related to purchases of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).

_Net cash flows generated from (used in) financing activities_

Net cash flows from financing activities consist of the drawdown and repayment of bank loans, finance
leases and shareholder debt.

Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was £34.0 million and
related entirely to lease capital payments. These lease capital payments represent a proportion of the
property rental costs as accounted for under IFRS 16, with the remaining rental cost accounted for
within net cash used in operating activities.

Net cash generated from financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was £229.3 million
and consisted of £270.0 million equity injection from an issue of share capital in the period, which was
partially offset by a cash outflow of £31.1 million lease capital payments and £6.5 million repayment
of the government COVID-19 loans previously received in Denmark.

Net cash flow generated from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £198.8
million and primarily a result of a £270.0 million equity injection from an issue of share capital. This
inflow was offset by £61.2 million of lease capital payments. Lease capital payments increased by £12.2
million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the expansion of the estate, repayment
of rent amounts deferred during site closure periods and following on from the rent-free periods
negotiated with landlords for the 2021 lockdown period due to COVID-19.

Net cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £1.5 million and
primarily the result of the Group issuing an additional €45 million (£38.8 million) of our Existing Euro
Notes in March 2021 in addition to £6.5 million in interest-free Danish government loans. This was
offset by £49.0 million of lease capital payments.

Net cash flow generated from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was £327.2
million and primarily a result of our acquisition of Fitness World, which generated an inflow of £380.9
million as described above. In addition, the Group issued a total of £100.7 million of preference shares
as part of the Recapitalization by our shareholders, to replace financial capacity eroded by the
COVID-19 lockdown. This inflow was offset by the repayment of £118.0 million debt acquired from
Fitness World and £37.0 million of lease capital payments.

**_Capital expenditure cashflow_**

The table below presents a breakdown of our capital expenditure cash flow for the periods indicated.

97


-----

Capital expenditure of £51.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased from £34.2 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily as a result of investments in the new corporate-owned
sites opened in the six months ended June 30, 2023, plus additional expenditures on sites due to open
in the second half of 2023.

In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we opened 22 new corporate-owned gyms (20 in the UK, and 2
in Switzerland). The Initial Capital Investment for each gym is estimated to be on average £1.2 million
for a large box gym, on average £1.1 million for a medium box gym and on average £0.7 million for a
small box format gym. Part of the cost of gyms opened in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was
incurred in 2022 as some gyms were in development prior to the start of the year. See “Business—Gym
_format and size.”_

The increase was also due to additional maintenance and refurbishment projects to maintain and
improve the quality of our existing estate. We maintain a comprehensive maintenance and
refurbishment program for our gyms, with initial and ongoing capital expenditures consisting of
expenses in relation to equipment, fixtures and fittings, IT and leasehold costs. We estimate that a large
box format UK gym will generally be fully refurbished within six to eight years of opening at a cost of
approximately £0.6 million per gym and this cost will typically be phased in over the sixth to eighth
years following opening.

Capital expenditure of £89.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 increased from £47.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of new sites
(and therefore total Initial Capital Investment). In addition, maintenance and refurbishment capital
expenditure increased over the same period as the business returned to a more normal refurbishment
pattern compared to the cash preservation measures applied during the COVID-19 closure periods.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, our estate increased by 45 corporate-owned gyms, including
40 in the UK, two in Switzerland and three in the United States. As part of an estate optimization plan
in Denmark, five Danish gyms were permanently closed, with the majority of members successfully
migrated to alternative nearby gyms within our estate.

Capital expenditure of £47.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 increased from £46.3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2020 to primarily as a result of an increase in maintenance and
refurbishment capital expenditure.

**Contractual obligations and commitments**

Other than our debt obligations described above and the debt we will incur as a result of the
Transactions, the Group’s contractual commitments are principally related to property lease rentals,
representing rent payable by it for our gym sites. The following table sets forth our total contractual
obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2023 after giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions,_
including the issuance of the Notes in the Offering.

**Qualitative and quantitative disclosures concerning market risk**

In the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to a variety of market risks including credit
risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Group monitors and manages these
risks as part of our overall risk management and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on our
financial position and performance. Exposures to market risk are discussed in more detail in note 21 of
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This discussion does not address other risks to which we are
exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. The key market risks affecting the Group are interest rate risk and
foreign exchange rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain borrowings
and deposits. Financial instruments affected by exchange rate risk include the Existing Euro Notes. At
June 30, 2023, the €490 million Euro Notes had a carrying amount of £413.3 million based on an
amortized cost of €480.7 million and an exchange rate of €0.8598 to £1.00. As of the year ended
December 31, 2022, the Existing Euro Notes had a carrying amount of £423.5 million based on an
amortized cost of €478.1 million and an exchange rate of €0.886 to £1.00. Had the exchange rate at
December 31, 2022 been 10% higher, then our loss for the year would have increased by £42.3 million.
Foreign exchange rate risk on our Existing Euro Notes is partially mitigated through the cash flows and
value of our investments in subsidiaries denominated in Danish Krone, which is pegged against the
Euro. However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the relative value of our Danish
operations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. Exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates
relates primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates.

As at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate
instruments by way of senior secured notes, amounts owed to Group undertakings and lease liabilities.
The Group has access to a £145 million Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility with floating
interest rates but as at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the facility was undrawn.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board. Liquidity risk is managed
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial
assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves.

Exposures to liquidity risk are discussed in note 21 of the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a member or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet our contractual obligations.

Principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is minimized due to exposure being
spread over a large number of customers who generally pay by direct debit in advance. The credit risk
on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.

Exposures to credit risk are discussed in note 21 of the consolidated financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Critical accounting policies and estimates and forthcoming changes**

In the application of our accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. Significant accounting policies are set out in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and significant accounting judgements, estimates and
assumptions are set out in note 3 of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Overview of the health and fitness club market**

**_European health and fitness club market_**

The European health and fitness club market had total revenues of €28 billion as of December 2022,
almost reaching the pre-COVID-19 revenues of €28.2 billion as of December 2019 (Source:
_Deloitte/EuropeActive Report), and similarly, fitness club membership volumes have reached pre-_
COVID-19 levels and continued the previously shown consistent growth across most European
geographies, driven by structural trends towards greater consumer health awareness and high
importance, government support and promotion of fitness, as well as continued increase in gym
capacity. Over the four years from February 2015 to February 2019, gym membership in Europe was
estimated to have increased from 54 million to 65 million, which reflects an estimated CAGR of 4.7%
(Source: OC&C Report). In 2022, European memberships increased by approximately 7 million
members, or 12%, from 56 million in 2021 to 63 million. (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report).

_(Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report)_

**_Increased focus on health and wellness_**

The COVID-19 pandemic further increased consumers’ focus on health and wellness, driving
significant growth in the frequency with which consumers exercise. Based on market research

101

conducted in the UK, 88% of UK consumers showed a greater concern for their wellbeing in 2021,
compared to 84% in 2019, and consumers also consistently ranked physical exercise within their top
four most important lifestyle activities, above eating and drinking out, holidays abroad, shopping and
going to live events or movies (Source: _Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report)._

_Importance of Health, Wellness and Exercise: UK Case Study_

Another market survey, conducted in May 2023, indicated that 95% of UK gym users exercise at least
once a week compared to only 74% pre-COVID-19. The increased focus on health and fitness in the
UK is also driven by UK government health and fitness initiatives, including “Change4Life,” a public
health program that began in 2009 to tackle unhealthy lifestyles by encouraging exercise and healthy
eating, and a health incentives scheme where users wore wrist-worn devices and completed dietary
surveys that generated personalized health recommendations targeting physical activity and diet.

_Increased Exercise Since COVID-19 is Driving Membership Growth_

It is also worth noting the demographic differences in the fitness industry. Young adults tend to be more
committed to health and fitness and have, therefore, seen a more significant increase in exercise
frequency post-COVID-19. In a recent survey conducted in the UK in May 2023, the number of young
adults (aged 18-24) that exercised over three times a week increased to 44%, an increase of 13% from
30.6% in July 2019 and 7% higher than the 37% for all adults (Source: OC&C Report). We believe that
this trend particularly favors the Group, as our business model skews towards younger demographics.

**_Resilience of the health and fitness club market_**

While the recent increase in the cost of living and inflationary pressures have impacted the consumer
sentiment in the UK and Europe due to the potential squeeze on disposable income, the health and
fitness club market is expected to be more resilient compared to other consumer facing sectors. The
increasing importance of health and wellness for consumers makes gym-spend less discretionary in
nature and value club operators also benefit from trade-down of the mid-market and even premium
members.

As evidenced by the market survey conducted in May 2023, gym users prioritize spending in the area
of health and fitness ahead of spending on many other areas. Only 16% of UK consumers are likely to
reduce their spending on gym membership when redistributing their budget due to income squeeze.
This is significantly below other spending buckets such as eating and drinking out, attending events,
shopping and going away on holiday.

_Gym Membership Spend is Likely to be Protected by Consumers: UK Case Study_

Within the discretionary consumer spend categories, the gym-spend is viewed as resilient through
economic downturns as it targets value-seeking consumers through attractive monthly costs and flexible
membership terms. As evidenced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, gym spend continued to grow
despite falling GDP in the UK.

_Resilience of Spend on Gyms is Expected Given Evidence from Last Major Recession, where Spend on_

_Gyms is Significantly Less Cyclical than Other Categories_

Furthermore, based on a survey conducted in the UK, the young demographic customers (16-29 yearsold) are less exposed to the increase of monthly cost of living when compared to the UK population as
a whole and, therefore, are less concerned about the Cost of Living Crisis (Source: OC&C Report).
This drives increased resilience in the segment as members less than 35 years old are less likely to
cancel their gym membership than those in the 35 to 54 year-old age bracket. As a result, only 22% of
our members indicate the likelihood of canceling or switching gyms in the next 12 months, which is
less than the 24% to 40% likelihood of our peers in the UK.

_<35 Y/O are Less Likely to Cancel Their Gym Membership_

**_Health and fitness club segments_**

Generally, the health and fitness club market is split into two main segments: public clubs and private
clubs. The private clubs’ segment can be further split into: (i) premium clubs; (ii) mid-market clubs and
(iii) value clubs.

Public clubs are those funded and operated by local authorities or county councils. They are typically
larger in size compared to private clubs and offer a wide variety of facilities such as sports halls, studios
and swimming pools. Some public clubs are managed or operated by private companies on behalf of
local authorities and county councils. Public clubs are generally open to members of the public on a
pay-and-play or membership basis. Private clubs are those funded and operated by commercial
enterprises, including value, mid-market and premium gym offerings. The private club market is
generally significantly larger than the public club market.

Mid-market and premium clubs are generally larger in size and usually contain a wider range of
facilities that for example include wet areas (e.g., swimming pools, spas and saunas), racquet sports
courts (e.g., tennis courts and squash courts), health and wellbeing facilities and social areas for

104


-----

members (e.g., bars and cafes). Additionally, members are often required to sign up to fixed-duration
membership contracts, which typically include early termination fees.

Mid-market and premium clubs generally have higher operating costs than value clubs due to their
larger size, high-cost sales process, increased number of facilities offered, greater number of staff (e.g.,
in-gym sales and marketing teams and fully staffed reception and refreshment areas) and higher
maintenance costs (e.g., cleaning and maintenance of wet areas).

Value clubs generally charge lower membership fees per month as compared to mid-market and
premium private clubs. Value clubs offer a more focused product that is designed for consumers who
only want to pay for and use fitness equipment (e.g., cardiovascular machines, fixed resistance
machines, free-weights and fitness studios), rather than wet facilities such as swimming pools, spas and
saunas. Members of value clubs are generally not required to sign up to fixed-duration membership
contracts and can generally cancel their memberships at any time without material financial
consequence. Often, value clubs are more tech-enabled, in order to keep operating costs low, and
generally have longer opening hours than traditional private clubs (e.g., many of our gyms are open 24hours-a-day (where available), seven-days-a-week and 365-days-a-year).

**_Growth of value club segment_**

In the global health and fitness club market, there has been a rising trend of customers moving towards
value operators and this is expected to further accelerate. In Europe, and in the UK in particular, value
operators have historically driven fitness market growth. Between February 2015 and February 2022,
value clubs accounted for 91% of member additions in Europe (based on the leading 15 operators) and
82% in the UK (Source: _Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report)._

As a value clubs operator, we benefit from consumers trading down from the mid-market and premium
offerings in the current market conditions. In the UK, the value segment grew by 274,000 members, an
increase of 10% from 2022 to 2023, driven by inflow of new fitness users and trade-down of 179,000
members from the mid-market and public gym operators. This also reflects that the offering of value
clubs resonates with consumers, further demonstrated by stable member value retention between
January 2020 and June 2023.

_High monthly member value retention reflects resonance of value proposition with consumers_

In the UK, the value club segment share as a percentage of membership has increased from 20% to 27%
over the four years between February 2016 and February 2019 and to 30% in March 2023, an increase
of 3% from February 2019, indicating that value clubs have continuously taken market share (Source:
_OC&C Report)._

In Denmark, the market share of value operators increased from 67% to 71% between 2016 and 2022.
In Switzerland, the market share of the value segment also saw an increase from 14% to 19% for the
same period. (Source: OC&C Report).

Value clubs are expected to continue to increase their market shares in the next five years with an
estimated market share of 40% in the UK, 73% in Denmark and 25% in Switzerland, respectively
(Source: OC&C Report).

_Geographies…_

106


-----

_…with Expected Continued Growth in Share from 2023 to 2028_

We believe that this growth has primarily been driven by the economically superior business model of
value clubs. The value club business model offers high value for money, no frills and flexible service
to its customers compared to traditional mid-priced clubs, while operating at a fraction of the cost of
more traditional models. This low cost is achieved by low initial capex, minimum staffing and an
economic approach to other operating costs. We believe that scale and consistency in execution have
been the pre-requisite factors to enable a select few players globally to successfully leverage this
approach, resulting in high capital returns which in turn have driven further growth and economies of
scale in a ‘virtuous circle’ of reinvestment.

The small number of global leading health and fitness club players that successfully operated the value
model have historically been able to capitalize on the shift towards the value club segment due to their
strong economies of scale. Such global leading players have multiplied their total number of sites by a
factor of three to nine times between 2013 and 2022 (Source: Company annual reports 2022). The
expansion of capacity has been accompanied by growth in memberships and rise in fitness accessibility
and penetration.

**Overview of the UK health and fitness club market**

The UK health and fitness club market has grown from a total value of £4.2 billion as of February 2015
to £5.0 billion as of February 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 4.7%. Over this same period, the number of
health and fitness clubs grew from 6,300 to 7,200, reflecting a CAGR of 3.5%, while the number of
health and fitness club members grew from 8.8 million to 10.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 4.3%
(Source: OC&C Report).

As of February 2023, the UK gym market has reached an estimated market size of £5.3 billion,
reflecting a CAGR of 1.3% from £5.0 billion in 2019, with approximately 7,000 clubs and 10.0 million
members. This illustrates that the UK health and fitness club market has recovered to 106% in terms of
market size, 97% in clubs and 96% in members compared to pre-COVID-19 levels in December 2019.
(Source: OC&C Report).

**Public Clubs**

As of February 2023, there were 2,539 public clubs in the UK, reflecting a CAGR of (1.8%) from the
2,729 public clubs in February 2019. The public market saw 3.1 million members as of February 2023,
reflecting a CAGR of (2.1%) from the 3.4 million in February 2019. The number of public clubs
decreased marginally over February 2015 to February 2019 from approximately 2,800 to approximately
2,700, reflecting a CAGR of (0.3%), while the number of public club members increased from 3.3
million to 3.4 million, reflecting a CAGR of 0.4%, resulting in a market value increase of £0.1 billion
from £1.3 billion to £1.4 billion, reflecting a CAGR of 1.5% (Source: OC&C Report).

**Private Clubs**

The private club market is significantly larger than the public club market, with approximately 4,460
clubs as of February 2023 from 4,510 clubs in February 2019, and 7.0 million members as of
February 2023, remaining constant from February 2019 (Source: OC&C Report). The number of
private clubs increased from approximately 3,500 as of February 2015 to approximately 4,500 as of
February 2019 (Source: OC&C Report). Over this same period, the number of private club members
grew from 5.4 million to 7.0 million, while private club market value has increased from £2.9 billion to
£3.7 billion (Source: OC&C Report). The growth in the private club market since 2015 was primarily
driven by the growth of value clubs. See “—Historical growth of value clubs.” The private club market
is highly fragmented, with multiple players of similar size and reach in terms of club and member count,
as demonstrated in the table below. The eight largest private club operators, as of December 2022, only
accounted for 26% of the private club market (by number of gyms) as of February 2023 (Source: OC&C

**Value clubs compared to Mid-Market and Premium clubs**

In the UK, value clubs are private clubs that generally charge £25 or less per month across the majority
of clubs in the chain and premium gyms are those that generally charge over £60 per month. Upper
mid-market gyms typically charge between £60 and £40, and lower mid-market-gyms charge less than
£40 but more than value club monthly membership fees. As of February 2023, there were 3,667 total
mid-market and premium clubs in the UK with 4.0 million total members, equivalent to an approximate
average of 755 members per mid-market club and 2,397 members per premium club (Source: OC&C
_Report)._

**Historical growth of value clubs**

The value club market has experienced rapid growth over the five years between 2015 and 2019. Since
February 2015, the number of value clubs in the UK increased from approximately 300 to

109


-----

approximately 700 as of February 2019, reflecting a CAGR of 21.0%, while the number of value club
members grew from 1.3 million to 2.8 million, reflecting a CAGR of 20.5%. Post-COVID-19 as of
February 2023, the number of value clubs is estimated to be 793 compared to 683 in February 2019,
reflecting a CAGR of 3.8%, with 3.0 million members compared to 2.8 million in 2019, reflecting a
CAGR of 1.5%. (Source: OC&C Report). While value clubs represented 9% of the total number of
health and fitness clubs in the UK as of February 2019, they represented 27% of the total number of
health and fitness club members for the same period. Post-COVID-19 as of February 2023, value clubs
represented 11% of clubs and 30% of members as value clubs have a substantially higher number of
average members per club. The largest value club operators in the UK are PureGym and The Gym
Group (Source: OC&C Report).

The private club market has historically been served primarily by mid-market and premium private
clubs. However, value clubs have made a significant entrance into the market by taking market share
from mid-market clubs and growing the overall number of private club members by attracting new
consumers to the market that have not previously been members of health and fitness clubs. Between
February 2015 and February 2023, value clubs accounted for 82% of new fitness club membership
additions in the UK. We believe that value clubs have been able to take market share because they offer
a more affordable, flexible and “value for money” product than other private clubs, and value clubs
address the most significant barriers to UK consumers taking on gym memberships (high membership
fees and fixed-duration membership contracts), appealing to a broad range of consumers.

While the value club segment has grown quickly over the past several years, we believe there remains
significant opportunity for further growth due to value club’s broad consumer appeal. The UK gym
market is large with a £5.3 billion market size in 2022 and growing in terms of gym memberships
between 2015 and 2022. As of 2022, 16% of the UK population have gym memberships, which is below
penetration rates in Denmark of 17% in 2023 and the U.S. of 22% in 2021 (Source:
_Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report). Given the UK has a high average monthly membership_
fee of £40, the UK value club sector has headroom for even further penetration growth.

The recent shift in UK consumer trends towards “value for money” is also prevalent in other industries.
Looking at the supermarket industry, value operators such as Lidl and Aldi have taken market share
from incumbent mid-market operators like WM Morrison and Tesco. Another example is the airline
industry, where value carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair have taken market share (in terms of number
of passengers) from traditional premium airlines like British Airways. An underlying element of this
trend is the simplicity and consistency of a high-quality, yet affordable offering that aims to perfect the
core product with “no frills.”

**Value club operators in the UK**

We are the largest value club operator in the UK, with 352 clubs and 1.4 million members as of June
30, 2023, and are over 1.5 times larger, by number of clubs and members, than the second value club
operator, The Gym Group (Source: Company information). There can be significant differences in the
product offering of value club operators. For example, PureGym and The Gym Group generally offer
24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week and 365-days-a-year access to clubs. Furthermore, compared to
other value clubs, PureGym clubs generally have dedicated group exercise studios, including purpose
built stationary cycling studios and offer a wide variety of instructor-led exercise classes in our studios.

**Overview of the Danish health and fitness club market**

From 2016 to 2019, the number of health and fitness clubs in Denmark grew from an estimated 1,330
to 1,430, while the number of health and fitness club members grew from 1.03 million to 1.10 million,
each reflecting an increase of 2.0%. (Source: OC&C Report). In February 2023, the Danish health and
fitness market comprised of 0.98 million members compared to 1.1 million in 2019 and approximately
1,520 clubs as of February 2023 compared to the approximately 1,430 in 2019, reflecting an increase
in clubs of 2.0%. As of February 2023, 16.8% of the Danish population are members of a health and
fitness club. (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report).

**Public Clubs**

The public club market in Denmark is mainly operated in smaller cities in connection with a local sports
club. As of February 2023, there were 530 public clubs with a total of 140,000 members, equivalent to
an average of 264 members per club (Source: OC&C Report). The number of public clubs remained
largely constant from February 2020 to February 2023 at 530. The number of public club members
decreased from 170,000 as of February 2019 to 140,000 as of February 2020 and remained flat
thereafter (Source: OC&C Report).

**Private Clubs**

In Denmark, the private club market is significantly larger than the public club market, with an
estimated 990 clubs and 840,000 members as of February 2023 (Source: OC&C Report). Number of
private clubs increased from approximately 800 as of February 2016 to 900 as of February 2019.
(Source: OC&C Report). Over this same period, the number of private club members grew from
840,000 to 930,000 (Source: OC&C Report). Growth of the private club market can be attributed to
prioritization of health and wellness by the Danish population and continued growth of value clubs
within the sector.

members from an estimated 620 value clubs and 690,000 members as of February 2016. (Source:

value segment, as the value sector accounted for approximately 72% of the Danish gym market, in terms
of membership, as of February 2023. Despite the high market share, the value club sector is expected
to continue to grow in Denmark in terms of membership, with the value segment gaining share, as is
shown in the graphic below (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report).

High market share of value clubs is driven by the leading position of PureGym in Denmark and
customer preference for an affordable, flexible and “value for money” product.

**Overview of the Swiss health and fitness club market**

The Swiss health and fitness club market has grown steadily in recent years. Between February 2015
and February 2019, the number of health and fitness club members in Switzerland grew from an
estimated 0.95 million to an estimated 1.26 million. As of February 2022, the estimated memberships
were 1.16 million and approximately 13.3% of the Swiss population was a member of a health and
fitness club (Source: OC&C Report).

The growth in health and fitness club members from February 2015 to February 2019 reflected
population growth driven by continued net positive immigration and penetration rate growth driven by
increased fitness supply and health consciousness. Post-COVID-19, the Swiss fitness market has
exhibited healthy recovery and has recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels of club membership and number
of clubs. The Swiss health and fitness club market had 1.20 million members as of February 2023
compared to 1.18 million in 2019.

Switzerland has the highest average gym/fitness club membership fees in Europe, due to the high wage
and price level in Switzerland. As of February 2022, the average monthly club fee in Switzerland was
approximately €78 per month, compared to £40 in the UK and €32 in Denmark (Source: OC&C
_Report). The Swiss market is also estimated to have a smaller low-cost segment, at 20% of the total_
member base, than similarly developed European markets, such as in Northern Europe. Compared to
developed European markets, gym penetration in Switzerland has considerable headroom for growth
and is expected to grow.

The top three operators in the Swiss fitness market account for approximately 31% of the total
membership base (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report). Most health and fitness club
operators in Switzerland offer fixed contracts of 12 months, requesting upfront membership fee
payments. We are the first to offer monthly rolling memberships in Switzerland and are by far the
largest value operator in the country with a three times larger membership base compared to the second
largest value player in the country as of 2022.

**Overview**

We are the second largest gym and fitness operator in Europe by number of gyms, with over 550 sites
and approximately 1.9 million members across our estate. We provide high quality, low cost, flexible
physical fitness facilities and have market leading positions in each of our three key markets: the UK,
Denmark and Switzerland.

Our operating model provides a powerful customer proposition that is differentiated from traditional
gym operators and appeals to a broad range of consumers. The key elements of our model proposition
include affordable membership fees, flexible contracts, a large footprint in each of our key markets and
24/7 access (in most locations) to high-quality gyms. This proposition is underpinned by the
differentiated, capital-efficient and technology-enabled gym operating model, which enables us to
support high levels of membership, operate on low costs and generate strong unit economics, cash flow
conversion and ROCE, and provides us with a strong platform for expansion.

Our strategic mission is to be a leading provider of affordable and flexible fitness memberships to
high-quality fitness facilities in current and new markets. Our customer value proposition, differentiated
business model and well-managed growth strategy has allowed us to grow rapidly in multiple
geographies through new site roll-outs, acquisitions and membership expansion. We are the largest
operator of gyms in the UK both by number of gyms and members. Following our acquisition of the
Fitness World Group in 2020, we also became the leading operator in Denmark by number of gyms and
members and the leading value gym operator in Switzerland by number of gyms and members. In 2021,
we launched a franchise model with the first franchised sites opening in the Middle East, which has
allowed us to bring our affordable, accessible gym proposition to a number of exciting new markets
and provides a platform for expanding our franchised offering to other territories in the future. In 2022,
we also opened our first three corporate-owned gyms in the U.S. with over 11,000 members as of
June 30, 2023.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, we generated revenue of £515.3 million and a Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA of £128.4 million, an increase of 14% and 19%, respectively, from the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

**_Key Strengths_**

We believe that our key strengths are as follows:

**_Attractive and resilient fitness market driven by the winning value segment gym model_**

The European health and fitness club market had total revenues of €28 billion as of December 2022,
almost reaching the pre-COVID-19 revenues of €28.2 billion as of December 2019 (Source:
_Deloitte/EuropeActive Report), and similarly, fitness club membership volumes are recovering towards,_
and in some markets beyond, pre-COVID-19 levels. Memberships are showing consistent growth across
most European geographies, driven by structural trends towards greater consumer health awareness and
high importance, government support and promotion of fitness, as well as continued increase in gym
capacity. Over the four years from February 2015 to February 2019, gym membership in Europe was

114


-----

estimated to have increased from 54 million to 65 million, which reflects an estimated CAGR of 4.8%
(Source: OC&C Report). In 2022, European memberships increased by approximately 7 million
members, or 12% from 56 million in 2021 to 63 million (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report).

The value gym segment, in which we operate, has continued its long-term growth in both volume and
market share terms, as operators have expanded the market by providing affordable fitness options to
an underserved population. In all our key geographic markets, the value gym segment has continued to
gain share. In Europe, between 2015 and 2022, the share of net gym membership additions by 15 out
of the top 20 value operators was 91%. In all our core markets of the UK, Denmark and Switzerland
the value gym segment has also grown its share of memberships. For example, in the UK (the largest
market in Europe by revenue), between February 2015 and February 2023, value operators accounted
for 82% of net new member additions, meaning value share increased from 20% in 2016 to 28% in
2022, and again to 30% in 2023 (Source: Deloitte/EuropeActive Report, OC&C Report).

We believe the value fitness model will have greater overall success, compared to traditional fitness
models, due to its scalability and because it is economically superior to traditional gym center operating
models. The model generates significantly higher EBITDA due to lower costs (approximately £0.4
million EBITDA for a value gym as compared to approximately £0.3 million EBITDA for a mid-market
gym), lower capital expenditure to fit out each unit (£1.0 to £1.5 million for a value gym as compared
to £1.5 to £2.0 million for a mid-market gym). This delivers higher and more sustainable ROCE
(approximately 35% for a value gym as compared to approximately 18% for a mid-market gym)
(Source: Company information). For more information, see “—Operating model combines strong
_revenue management and low labor cost.”_

The gym market has demonstrated resilience during periods of both economic uncertainty and the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to the fitness
industry, causing gyms to close across all markets in Europe and inevitably membership numbers
declined significantly during these periods of disclosure. In spite of this, the market has recovered very
strongly and is now back to pre-pandemic levels. See “Industry Overview—Overview of the gym-based
_fitness market.” Many of the larger operators have emerged stronger following the pandemic, as gym_
operators required strong liquidity positions to be able to withstand the periods of extended closure
during local and nationwide lockdowns. Some weaker operators in both the value and mid-market gym
segments exited their respective markets, thereby increasing available space for expansion and creating
underserved demand. In addition, we believe that even if a weakened competitor did not exit the market,
it will, in general, struggle to maintain product quality because it will lack the resources to reinvest and
will struggle to raise new capital in the now more challenging market for financing.

The gym market has also traded strongly through previous economic downturns. This is well
demonstrated by data through the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, evidenced by an estimated
2.1% CAGR in total gym spend in the UK health and fitness club market between 2006 and 2012.
During this time period total gym spend did not fall during any individual year. From 2008 to 2012,
value gyms grew significantly, with membership increasing by an estimated CAGR of 121% (Source:
_OC&C Report)._

As the market figures show, gyms have continued to perform strongly through the recent economic
downturn. For example, in the UK memberships are estimated to have increased from 9.5 million in
February 2022 to 10 million in February 2023, representing an increase of over 5%. Consumer research
shows that consumers prioritize their gym memberships ahead of other areas of discretionary spend
such as eating out, holidays and clothing (Source: OC&C Report).

Against this backdrop, the value sector in the UK has performed particularly well, growing from
approximately 2.7 million memberships to 3.0 million memberships, from February 2022 to
February 2023, which is an increase of 10%. During this period, the value sector has benefitted from
members of premium, mid-market, and public sector gyms trading down, with a net inflow of 219,000
members between 2022 and 2023 alone (Source: OC&C Report).

Furthermore, we believe that the difficult macroeconomic environment seen in 2022 and the first half
of 2023 has provided further challenges for many businesses with pressure from energy costs, general
inflation, interest rates and consumers acting more cautiously. Because strong, well-capitalized players,
such as the Group, will be able to maintain product quality, our relative competitive position will, we
believe, improve over time. This is further evidenced by our cost of living indicators (such as website
traffic, web conversion rate, existing member upgrades, joiner ARPM (as defined below), member
discounting, bad debt recovery, financial concern cancellations and ancillary spend) which have
generally increased or remained consistent year over year in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.
Additionally, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, our UK bad debt collection rate was consistent
with the rate for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Despite the impact of COVID-19, concomitant
governmental lockdowns and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we have managed the
business well, having retained our leading market positions, optimized our cost structure, opened 98
sites between January 2020 and June 30, 2023 and continued to increase total member numbers to
1,855,000 as of June 30, 2023. For more on our resilience, see “—Excellent performance management
_and continuous improvement.”_

**_Excellent core product offering delivered across a broad range of site sizes_**

Our core product offering includes the following features:

- _High-quality facilities and inclusive philosophy—we aim to “offer a boutique fitness experience at_
a value gym price.” Our gyms are equipped with a large number of pieces of high-specification
gym equipment, including a broad selection of cardio machines, fixed resistance machines, free
weights and functional and other exercise equipment, such as TRX bands and kettlebells. Our gyms
are clean, well-maintained and are fitted out with high-quality changing rooms and shower
facilities. We offer a welcoming environment and support all members in the pursuit of their fitness
goals, regardless of their current abilities. This is demonstrated, for example, by our “everybody
welcome” philosophy;

- _Superior convenience and proximity to customers as a result of well-developed club network—we_
have the largest and most extensive gym network in the UK and Denmark, with over 50% more
sites in the UK than our closest competitor. This allows us to capitalize on potential members’
desire for proximity. We believe this to be a competitive advantage, given that research indicates
that proximity is among the top two most important factors for members when choosing a gym. In
Denmark we enjoy an even larger market share position and both scale and network advantage
than in the UK when compared to other operators;

- _Group exercise classes—we have dedicated group exercise studios, including purpose-built_
stationary cycling studios in many locations. Most of our gyms offer a wide variety of over 50
classes per week, taught by fitness professionals. Other operators in the value market do not
typically offer such an extensive range of group exercise classes;

- _Membership and access options—we offer flexibility through our range of enrollment offers,_
extended opening hours, premium or off-peak membership options and online membership
management; and

- _Highly effective utilization of space—unlike many mid-market and premium operators, we do not_
install pools, spas, saunas, steam room, extensive cafes or other high-end amenities in our gyms.
These amenities are generally expensive to construct, operate and maintain and take up a
significant amount of leased space. We believe that these amenities are generally less utilized by
members and that by eliminating them we are able to install more pieces of high utilization fitness
equipment, such as treadmills, free weights and stationary bikes. As a result, our gyms can support
high levels of membership while operating on low operating and initial capital investment costs.

116


-----

Our core product offering is hard to replicate at scale, due to our strong presence and member loyalty
in our key markets, and underpins our market leading positions as the number one value gym operator
in the UK, Denmark and Switzerland and number two gym operator in Europe.

**_Great consumer value proposition_**

We have a compelling consumer value proposition. Key elements of this proposition include:

- _Flexible membership—members can sign up with flexible contracts. Accordingly, members have_
the freedom and the flexibility to leave at their convenience without incurring cancellation fees
and have the ability to freeze their memberships for months at a time;

- _Easy to join and online membership management—our online website and app platforms allow_
members to join in just two minutes, manage their memberships, freeze or cancel their
membership, book classes, locate gym facilities, track fitness data and engage in fitness challenges.
This ability to self-serve is convenient for members and lowers costs for the business;

- _Digital integration—we blend high-tech with high performance, including digital studios,_
interactive screens, a coherent online offer and content for workouts and exercise at home when
not in the gym, all of which are available via the PureGym app;

- _Affordable pricing—our flexible and low-cost membership structure provides excellent value for_
money for our members, with student discounts, day passes and off-peak membership options
available in many locations. These options further minimize costs for our members, often enabling
access to affordable fitness where there previously was none. Our variable pricing model, tailored
to the local market, is crucial to maximizing performance and allows us to tailor the offer to each
individual location;

- _Multi-gym access—members can buy an option to access any of our gyms in each country, many_
of which are open 24/7; and

- _Quality equipment and classes—we offer quality gyms, with members able to access_
approximately 50 face-to-face classes per week in many gyms, combined with nutrition, equipment
and personal training options.

Members receive all the above for a price significantly lower than in typical mid-market and premium
gyms. Our average monthly revenue per member was £24.55 as at June 30, 2023 and £24.61 for the six
months ended June 30, 2023, with mid-market and premium gyms typically charging significantly
more.

**_Operating model combines strong revenue management and low labor cost_**

We believe that the value fitness model is economically superior to traditional gym and fitness center
operating models through a combination of low fit-out capex, low equipment and maintenance spending
and high membership density. We believe that the resulting average return on invested capital, per site,
in value gyms is approximately double compared to a typical mid-market operators. As a result, those
operators who successfully deploy the value business model (such as the Group and our international
peers, Basic-Fit, SmartFit and Planet Fitness), benefit from attractive unit margins, rapid paybacks on
initial investment and high ROCE. Therefore, they are able to quickly redeploy capital to support further
network growth, further enhancing scale and associated economies. Our operating model benefits from
the following features:

- _Low personnel costs—we are able to operate our gyms with low levels of employed personnel_
primarily through the use of technology. For example, we offer an online and app-based enrollment
process, which eliminates the need for a dedicated in-gym sales forces, which are commonly used
by mid-market and premium operators. Members also use fully-automated PIN-controlled entry
portals, QR readers for apps, or member cards to facilitate secure access to our gyms, which largely

117


-----

eliminates the need for staff covering reception desks to control entry. We believe we can further
increase personnel cost efficiency, and thereby improve margins, by applying some best practices
from our operating model to our more recently acquired gyms in continental Europe through
measures such as unmanned hours covered by video surveillance with tailored alert systems;

- _Pricing sophistication—we have built sophisticated pricing capability, which gives us the ability_
to employ variable pricing in all gyms in order to tailor our price point to the specific local market.
This allows us to adapt to local markets by managing member enrollment, refine promotional
investment and thus optimize revenues;

- _Purchasing scale—we are one of only a small number of large, global, value fitness businesses._
This provides us with purchasing scale across our key geographies and results in lower costs. We
believe we are the largest purchaser of gym equipment in our key geographies from leading
suppliers including Matrix and Precor, thereby reducing the costs of constructing and operating
our gyms (such procurement costs for equipment costs can, we believe, be up to 30% to 40% lower
for large players and fit out costs can be up to 10% to 20% lower);

- _Ability to invest—our scale and resources allow us to rapidly develop new sites and invest in other_
areas of our business, such as technology, which enable us to operate more efficiently and deliver
a better customer experience. Our reinvestment and refurbishment capability further differentiates
us from smaller cash-constrained competitors;

- _Brand—we have an international brand that benefits from higher levels of brand awareness than_
other value gym operator in our key markets. The scale and both nationwide and international
footprints allow us to effectively pursue marketing campaigns such as social media and TV
advertisements. We invest digitally, nationally and locally to build brand awareness and
consideration. Our brand is also supplemented by our PureGym app, with many users and a wide
reaching, highly engaged social media following. For example, as at June 30, 2023, in the UK, the
brand benefits from a combined social media following of over 1.5 million users across all major
channels and both national and local gym accounts. In Denmark, despite the fact that the PureGym
brand was only launched in 2023, we have achieved online traffic shares of 50%-60% versus our
close competition (Source: _Company information); and_

- _Leading marketing expertise driving strong brand awareness—we have an increasingly_
sophisticated, multi-channel digital-led marketing strategy, which is not overly reliant on any
single channel. We employ a range of marketing techniques through various media channels in
order to promote a contemporary and differentiated brand, which would be difficult for new
entrants to replicate given our resources and prior marketing experience.

Our highly predictable new site performance and strong unit economics drive sustainable margins,
excellent cohort performance and cash flow generation. We believe that our performance metrics
demonstrate that we have developed a leading operating model in the value gym arena, with a revenue
CAGR of 30%, an Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of approximately 29%, a Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
CAGR of 23%, an operating free cash flow CAGR of approximately 23%, a number of gyms CAGR
of approximately 26% and a number of members CAGR of 22%, in each case over the 2014 to 2019
period (including the acquisition of Fitness World).

Furthermore, we believe that this strong track record is underscored by our recent results. Over the last
three fiscal quarters, we had an over 50% increase in Adjusted EBITDA as shown in the chart below.

118


-----

Our Adjusted EBITDA grew over 39%, revenue grew 17%, our membership grew 11%, our UK
membership grew 16% and our ARPM grew 4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, when compared to the month of December 2022,
our revenue increased over 57% in the month of June 2023, as illustrated in the chart below.

In the UK, for the year ended December 31, 2022, our average revenue per member per month was
£23.84, as compared to The Gym Group’s £17.82, which is the other main operator in the European
value market; our Average Mature Gym Adjusted EBITDA per site was £412,000, as compared to the
Gym Group’s £270,000; our UK Mature Gym ROCE was 34% as compared to the Gym Group’s 20%.

**_Superior technology platform and digital capabilities_**

We operate an industry-leading technology platform and have invested heavily in building out our
digital presence, technology infrastructure and tech-based functionality over the last eight years. Our
cumulative technology investment to date is approximately £60 million and is approaching 300
person-years of time spent by software engineers on our technology platform. As a result, we have a
high and increasing degree of control over, and the ability to improve, our web, mobile and
application-based offerings, and operate a sophisticated, integrated back-end system. Our scale has
given us an advantage with respect to technology, and we believe that technological innovation and

119


-----

investment into the proprietary stack will help reduce costs and increase revenues over time. Key
features of our technology include:

- _Website and dedicated apps that, among other functions, provide members with the ability to enroll_
and upgrade into the various membership packages, utilize nutrition and exercise guides, view
workout videos and live and on-demand classes, find and book classes, see how busy their gym is,
track their gym activity, follow workout plans and track body composition metrics. The digital
front-end is used by us to proactively engage members, manage their experience and drive lifetime
value;

- _Digital content production and delivery capabilities allowing us to continuously expand our library_
of content for members;

- _On-site technology-enabled systems within individual gyms, including automatic PIN-based gym_
entry systems or access card gym entry and a growing number of self-serve/use-anytime digital
exercise studios across the estate; and

- _Software-based reporting and performance management systems providing advanced business_
insights and data analytics, which support decision-making across the business.

For more information on our technology platform and IT function, see “—Technology.”

**_Superior skills, rigor and sophistication in site selection and development_**

Given our established operating track record and position as a value gym industry leader in our key
markets, we have acquired significant expertise in property acquisition and management. We are skilled
at identifying site locations that will be successful and provide strong ROCE. For example, our Average
Mature Gym ROCE for the UK was 35% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, which was a 1%
increase as compared to same period in 2022. Furthermore, our UK Average Mature Gym ROCE for
Mature Gyms established between 2018 and 2020 was 36% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023.
We believe that as our mature business continues to recover, our ROCE will continue to increase, as
illustrated in the graphic below.

In order to maintain our market-leading positions, we have strong site selection and property
development teams with industry expertise supported by an external team of professionals, such as
lawyers and planning consultants, as well as strong technological tools at our disposal. In particular, we
utilize a quantitative whitespace tool to identify attractive new locations in all geographies. The

120


-----

whitespace tool takes into account population statistics, drive times, local demographics, competitor
locations and infrastructure (for example, proximity to train stations) when analyzing potential new
sites, as well as incorporating learnings from our extensive roll-out history and subsequent performance.
The whitespace tool both identifies attractive markets as well as optimal locations for roll-out within a
catchment.

Our rigorous approach to site selection, which includes approval of all new sites by the Capex
Committee, the CEO and the CFO, is designed to ensure a high-quality property pipeline and estate
management across all geographies in which we operate. We have dedicated property acquisition teams
that are highly experienced in their relevant geography’s property market and have strong relationships
with landlords, developers, agents and other gym operators and retailers who may be looking to divest
sites. We have historically had a strong landlord covenant rating and have benefitted from “tenant of
choice” status given our scale, strong brand and high-quality product. As a result, we are generally able
to secure our selected sites on attractive lease terms throughout Europe.

With respect to site development, we have longstanding relationships with a pool of established
contractors as well as with other key third-party business partners such as structural engineers, planning
advisors and other building services providers. Our strong relationships and continuity with these
partners have enabled us to cost-effectively develop and open a large number of new gyms each year,
while simultaneously delivering a consistently high level of quality. For more information on our site
selection and development process, see “—Property.”

**_Excellent performance management and continuous improvement_**

Our senior management has an established track record of delivering growth and consistent operational
performance in their current roles at the company and in their prior roles at a range of other businesses.
Senior management is supported by an experienced management team in key areas, including property
acquisition, property development, operations, IT, marketing, legal, human resources, finance and
country level management. The senior management team is comprised of high caliber individuals with
strong educational backgrounds and broad experience from various sectors and previous businesses.
This ensures that our senior management and other important management teams are well invested and
are capable of executing both our focus on performance delivery and our growth strategy.

We have made substantial investments in management over recent years and important business
functions are now generally managed internally, which we believe provides us with a competitive
advantage. For example, important IT functions were brought in-house in recent years and the IT team
was strengthened with a number of new hires (including a new Chief Information Officer) to build and
maintain an industry-leading technology platform.

The outputs of a sustained program of active management have been very strong in terms of operational
and financial performance. In particular, our sophisticated pricing and revenue management approach
drives growth and is underpinned by four key principles: (1) optimal positioning towards the premium
end of the value segment, (2) using price to maximize site-opening volume and momentum, (3) setting
site-level prices based on the local market situation and (4) driving premiumization to enhance yield
from those willing to pay. New site pricing is actively managed to maximize volume growth in the near
term and secure yield and revenue in the medium to longer term, while variable headline pricing allows
specific tailoring to local markets and carefully controlled monthly core pricing changes as shown in
the graphics below (Source: Group information).

121


-----

This coherent revenue management process has delivered Average Revenue Per Member (“ARPM”)
(excluding VAT) growth since 2018, driven by like-for-like selling price increases and a higher likefor-like number of members joining or upgrading to a premium membership (on a three-month
average), with strong growth since early 2019. Moreover, under the current CEO, we grew from an
operator of 84 gyms with £37 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,
2014, to an operator of 566 corporate-owned gyms with £128 million of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. In the same time period, our members grew from 412,000
to 1,855,000 and revenue grew from £69 million to £515.3 million.

In addition to a strong track record of operational excellence and property acquisition expertise, our
leadership team also adheres to a balanced fiscal policy of deleveraging. Prior to COVID-19, we
reduced our senior secured net leverage from 4.6x in November 2017, to 4.0x in January 2018 and 3.6x
in December 2019. Since 2019 we have reduced our overall amount of senior secured net debt
(comprised of the Existing Notes and revolving credit facility drawings, if any, for the period minus
cash on balance sheet) to £614 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (comprised of £848
million of Existing Notes (with the Euro Notes translated at an LTM average exchange rate of €1.172
per £1.00), £204 million of cash on balance sheet (translated using respective LTM average exchange
rates and £30 million of cash held by our parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited)) from £810 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, with available liquidity of £356 million as of June 30, 2023
(includes cash on balance sheet as of June 30, 2023 of £180.3 million plus £31 million cash on balance
sheet held at our parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited).

Further, we have a clear deleveraging strategy for the future as we intend to:

- deploy capital in a considered and measured way to open new sites, improve existing sites and
deliver technology assets;

- reduce leverage by growing EBITDA through new site openings and the deployment of technology
assets in our core business and through capital-light franchising growth; and

- balance capital deployment with cash flow generation and progressive deleveraging.

We are targeting senior secured net leverage to operate between 3.6x to 4.6x by the end of 2024.

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to further expand our position as a market-leading value gym operator by providing
affordable, flexible and value-for-money memberships in high-quality gyms to anyone who wants to

122


-----

increase their level of fitness, while simultaneously delivering profitable growth. The key elements of
our strategy include:

**_Exploit structural growth opportunity in value gym sector_**

We plan to take advantage of both the opportunity to drive significantly increased penetration of gym
usage and the market shift from mid-market and premium gyms to value gyms. For more on how value
gyms are disrupting the market and taking market share, see “—Key Strengths—Attractive and resilient
_fitness market driven by the winning value segment gym model.” We plan to leverage our experience to_
continue the organic roll-out of new gyms with strong ROCE. Future growth in the value segment will
be driven by the development of new value gyms, continued market share gains from mid-market and
premium operators, as well as public gyms operated by local authorities, and overall growth in gym
participation rates due in part to the increasing awareness and availability of value gyms in each of our
markets. The significant opportunity for further growth in the value gym market is evidenced by:

- the significant success of the value gym concept to date and its broad consumer appeal;

- the current overall penetration rates of gym membership in existing markets; only 14.8% of the
British population as of February 2023, an estimated 16.8% of Danish population as of December
31, 2023, and 13.2% of the Swiss population as of February 2022 (Source: OC&C Report); and

- evidence that penetration can reach or exceed 20% in more mature markets, such as in the US,
Sweden and Norway (Source: OC&C Report).

We believe that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this substantial market penetration opportunity
as market leader in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland with a long, successful track record
of opening new gyms and rapidly growing membership, revenue and profitability. As more sites are
rolled out, gym penetration is projected to reach 17% in the United Kingdom by February 2028 (Source:
_OC&C Report)._

Furthermore, smaller, less well-capitalized value operators will, we believe, seek to exit sites rather than
reinvest or recommit to leases when facing competition. In continental Europe, growth will also come
from improvements to our existing sites, such as by reducing costs through operational efficiencies,
reequipping and reinvesting in our core sites and reconfiguring and consolidating our estate, rather than
solely from new site roll-out.

Finally, we seek to establish ourselves as the clear number one gym operator and maintain our position
as the leading value fitness operator in each of our core markets. In the UK and Denmark, we are by a
considerable distance the largest operator by volume of sites and membership. Furthermore, in the UK
we are the largest fitness brand with un-paralleled levels of consumer awareness and consideration.

**_Continue to lead in technology, innovation and operational excellence_**

We plan to continue leading in technology, innovation and operational excellence in a number of ways,
including:

- _Investing in our industry—leading technology platform—we continue to invest in our technology_
platform. The “front end” consists of both websites and mobile applications, where our members
can book classes, pay for their memberships and other ancillary services. The “back end” includes
all the investments made to continue to develop leading edge revenue and product management as
well as big data, BI and automated performance management applications. In all cases, we are
investing to ensure we can deploy similar technology capability in all of our geographies and
languages. We believe that our data and analytics model is best in class. As the fitness industry
increasingly converges with the digital sector, we believe that our technology platform allows our
members to more easily access and purchase our services, which helps us attract and retain
members. Additionally, our technology-enabled platform allows us to analyze user-specific data,
which in turn supports our operational performance. This allows our management to better control

123


-----

all aspects of our pricing strategy, product development and promotional activities. Furthermore,
the development of our technology is ongoing, and we plan to continue to utilize technology in
order to further reduce costs and improve efficiencies.

  - We believe that an “omni-channel” approach to fitness is increasingly expected by consumers,
and therefore we plan to continue to invest in our digital and connected offering and will
further deploy our own and third-party resources to develop software and content to deliver
our digital proposition.

  - Our approach seeks to serve a broad range of consumer needs by creating digital enablement
for members to get more out of their workout, whether at home or in the gym. This ranges
from simple digital workout classes for beginners to more sophisticated training programs
using best-in-class content from around the world. To optimize our personal training offering,
we also plan to create digital tools to facilitate the process of finding and interacting with our
large network of fitness professionals. We continue to use our scale and expertise to find
innovative means of using our digital capability to allow members to get the most out of their
workouts as well as measure, track and reward their progress.

- _Driving Average Revenue Per Member— we take a multi-layered approach to increasing ARPM_
by:

  - _Developing new commercial products—we have implemented and continue to develop new_
attendance/membership options to attract certain types of new members to our gyms and
increase our fee yields while consistently offering excellent value for money. For example,
we have continued to see an increase across our gyms in penetration of our premium
membership and bolt-on products, which include benefits such as the ability to pre-book
classes on a priority basis or obtain multi-site access and typically cost about £5 to £10 more
than a “Core” membership option on average and about £3 to £8 more for specific bolt-on
elements, respectively.

  - _Price progression—we have a sophisticated price management model, which utilizes variable_
pricing for our membership products based on local market demand and dynamics for each
site. Our operational experts tailor pricing to specific local markets and monitor and change
the specific prices over time as the market and its competition evolve. In turn, this allows us
to monitor member enrollment, manage capacity and maximize revenue and returns. For
example, in January 2023, we implemented a price rise in Denmark which resulted in ARPM
for the Group, as at June 30, 2023, increasing over 4% year-over-year to £24.55 from £23.68,
driving a 16.7% revenue growth in the six months ended June 30, 2023 when compared to the
same period ended June 30, 2022.

  - _Ensuring promotional investment is optimized and ARPM leakage is minimized—the value_
fitness market responds well to promotional activity, but it is crucial that this is managed
efficiently as otherwise excess value leakage takes place. We use our increasingly
sophisticated technology platform to target promotional investment at the right time for the
right duration, in the right places and using the right mechanics. We measure the true
efficiency and effectiveness of investments carefully so that plans can be optimized.

  - _Increasing ancillary sales per visit—ancillary sales are part of our initiative to increase_
ARPM. For example, we offer sports and energy drinks and protein snacks for purchase
through on-site vending machines.

  - _Optimizing site capacity—we seek to optimize the capacity utilization of our existing gyms_
where this is possible and viable. Capacity optimization can involve the physical extension of
gyms, or the redesign of certain aspects of gyms to eliminate site-specific utilization
bottlenecks, such as the substitution of low utilization equipment, or the installation of
additional automated entry portals or access gates to increase capacity.

124


-----

  - _Marketing and CRM—we have strengthened our marketing approaches and we take an_
increasingly sophisticated and data-driven approach to membership acquisition and retention.
Our brand awareness is strong but has further room for significant growth in the context of
our large estate of gyms. We utilize channels, such as television advertising and social media,
to increase brand awareness and drive membership growth. Additionally, our industry-leading
“front end” technology platform, including our mobile apps and websites, remain a low-cost,
high volume membership acquisition and marketing tool.

  - _Development of new sales channels and cross marketing—we are leveraging our nationwide_
scale across our key markets to identify opportunities to partner and enter into commercial
arrangements with large corporations, health insurance providers and employee benefit
portals that have the potential to deliver incremental membership volumes.

  - _Maintaining a rigorous focus on cost containment—our ability to offer low membership fees_
and generate strong unit economics and ROCEs is underpinned by our low-cost operating
model. As a result, we are focused on optimizing and controlling gym-level operating costs,
as well as Initial Capital Investment Costs. These costs are controlled centrally, and we intend
to continue to leverage our growing scale in order to achieve more favorable purchasing terms
with third-party suppliers, service providers and contractors. In addition, we are pursuing a
number of ongoing operational efficiency projects, such as energy saving initiatives, to
minimize future gym-level cost increases and improve returns.

  - _Capture full value of embedded value tailwind—following our return to 2019 UK revenue_
levels, we believe that we are well-positioned to drive strong performance in the future based
on our systematic and carefully managed approach to site enhancements and implementation
of our operational and pricing model in both our core estate and new site openings.

Management has successfully contained costs at the operating level, with cost inflation of only 0.5%
over the three year period from 2019 to 2022 on a like-for-like basis. Our structurally low operating
costs delivers and supports our gym site EBITDA margin of over 30%.

Furthermore, continued efforts from management on procurement and operating efficiencies are such
that operating cost inflation for 2023, compared to 2022, is expected to be contained below 5%, which
will largely be offset by yield progression, due to operational efficiencies in the period.

In particular, management has successfully focused on containing energy and utility costs, now and
through the end of 2024, as a result of obtaining future supply contracts fixing energy prices at moderate
rates, including future supply contracts for an estimated 90% of likely supply needs. This, together with
significant resources deployed on an initiative to reduce energy consumption across the Group by up to
20% over the next 12 to 24 months, means that energy cost increases across the Group are expected to
be limited to between £5 million and £8 million for 2024, when compared to 2022.

**_Apply PureGym operational excellence/best practices throughout our portfolio_**

We have a track record of successfully integrating acquired portfolios and driving value from such
acquisitions. Our acquisition of LA Fitness in 2015 (net 31 sites acquired) and Soho Gyms in 2018 (net
nine sites acquired) are good examples of this. In both instances, we have seen significant value creation
and performance uplifts. Following the acquisition of LA Fitness, we created significant value and
performance uplifts through active intervention, including implementing our technology platform,
operating model, performance management, refurbishment and cost synergies, which resulted in
doubling EBITDA from £10 million to £20 million post-acquisition. With respect to our acquired sites
in continental Europe, we have substantially rebranded the businesses and have implemented all of the
above.

In markets, such as Denmark, where we are targeting a growth in margin, EBITDA growth will derive
from improvements in the business rather than new site roll-out. The key levers to improve profitability

-----

and margin are cost reduction (involving, inter alia, reductions in per-site operating costs), revenue
growth (driven by a simplified product range and roll-out of our variable pricing model), estate
rationalization (including a transition to a more focused, higher quality and more profitable estate that
is sustainable into the future) and estate upgrades, such as a comprehensive physical and digital refresh
and implementation of the PureGym SmartSuite (with a new website, mobile app, marketing
automation, changed ways of working and business rules).

**_Expand in existing markets and through franchising opportunities_**

We plan to expand in our existing markets through site roll-out, but also believe that as a scaled player
with a ready-to-deploy, technology-driven value model, we can successfully expand in markets beyond
our current areas of presence, organically or via acquisitions or franchising. Overall, through a
combination of new corporate-owned and franchised operated sites, we believe we could potentially
grow our estate to approximately 1000 to 2000 new sites with an estimated three to four million new
members, although this would depend on a number of factors and investment decisions relating to our
growth and entry into new markets. In our key markets, we intend to capitalize on strategically identified
local areas with whitespace in value gym offerings, and we are targeting to open 45 new corporateowned sites and 14 franchise operated sites in 2023 (with 22 new corporate-owned and seven franchise
operated sites already opened as of June 30, 2023). Additionally, we plan to capitalize on ample
whitespace in the UK and opening an estimated 300 new gyms in the long-term.

In 2021, we launched our franchise model, which brings an affordable, accessible gym proposition to
markets with limited access to such facilities and provides an exciting platform to expand the franchised
offering to other territories. Our franchise model allows us to develop our estate network across other
areas of the world, leveraging our core intellectual property and optimized operating model, and create
value through low capital intensive EBITDA growth.

We believe the opportunity for international development through franchising has the potential to be
very large. We believe franchising presents a significant growth opportunity in the medium term and
thereafter and believe that franchise unit economics can be attractive for both us and franchisees. For
example, we believe that current and prospective franchise partners could launch approximately 400
franchised sites by 2028 across the globe.

We believe that there is significant underserved demand for value fitness and gyms of the nature we
provide in the Middle East and Asia. In particular, we believe Saudi Arabia offers significant potential
for value fitness. In 2022, we entered into a regional development agreement with the Al Hokair Group
to develop a minimum of 130 franchise sites across the Middle East. As of June 30, 2023, we had 16
franchised sites currently in operation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, excluding sites in pre-sales. We
believe that in the fullness of time the Middle Eastern franchise opportunity could be up to 300 sites.

We also believe that the North American market presents an attractive opportunity given the lack of
scaled value players other than Planet Fitness, the leading franchised player. In 2022, we opened our
first three gyms in the United States, which are corporate-owned and under the brand PureFitness, with
the aim of testing our low-cost, technology-enabled concept in a new international territory. Having
successfully tested our three corporate-owned gyms, we are now targeting to secure five to ten
franchisees as operating partners in the U.S. over the next five years who have the potential for at least
100 franchised sites, in order to expand our footprint across the U.S.

We also believe that the Japanese, South East Asian and ASEAN and Indian markets could be strong
franchise markets for us due to their large populations, including 700 million across ASEAN countries
and 1.3 billion people in India, that are largely underserved by a strong value gym operator.
Additionally, Japan has a low fitness penetration rate of 3.3% and does not have a strong value operator.
We also believe South Korea has a strong franchising market, with a population of 51 million and a
higher fitness penetration of 7%. We are actively pursuing a number of contacts and business
development opportunities in these regions. For more information on our franchise model, see “—
_Franchise Model.”_

**_Sustainability and ESG are key priorities for us_**

Sustainability—and more broadly environmental, social and governance (“S-ESG”)-related issues—is
an important area of focus for us as concerns with climate change increase, consumers and employees
become increasingly engaged with this topic and the obligations being placed on businesses become
clearer on making progress on S-ESG issues to the satisfaction of both regulators and capital providers.

First, and foremost, we believe our business exists to provide a social good, as our core purpose—to
provide accessible, flexible and affordable fitness and activity to all—plays a vital role in not only
improving people’s health and wellbeing, but also as a route to addressing obesity, helping to prevent
illness and improving mental health. Additionally, our business is inherently sustainable as gyms are
effectively a part of the “sharing economy” and, especially in the case of low cost/high volume gyms
like ours, are a good, sustainable use of resources. Because members effectively “rent” access to the
gym facilities and equipment for the hours that they need, the equipment utilization is high and is an
efficient use of resources rather than further mass production of relevant equipment for each individual.

Notwithstanding this positive starting position, we recognize there is increased consumer awareness of
the link between societal trends and sustainability-related issues, and there is some evidence that these
trends are driving consumer demand towards companies that chose to pay more attention—and more
authentic attention—to issues in the S-ESG arena. Therefore, we believe it also makes good business
sense to be proactive in addressing S-ESG issues, as well as there being support for this from many
investors and a growing sense of the moral obligation on leading companies to play an appropriate role
in this regard.

Following engagement with key stakeholders—employees, members, investors and third-party
partners—we have identified five key focus areas in which to develop our S-ESG strategy:

- _Delivering Social Good—supporting as many people as possible to live healthier lives;_

- _Empowering People—fostering a thriving healthy team and community where everyone feels_
welcome and supported to reach their potential;

- _Energy and Emissions—reducing our carbon footprint and efficient use of resources;_

- _Waste & Circulatory—minimizing operational waste and embedding circular-by-design principles_
across our operations; and

- _Effective Corporate Governance—building an environment of trust, transparency and_
accountability for sustainable performance.

In 2022, we fast-tracked our decarbonization plans due to the emergence of the energy crisis, primarily
resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict which commenced in February of 2022. We have been
working with a market leading operational improvement consultant to identify and pursue opportunities
to significantly reduce energy usage per site. In doing so, we are in the process of establishing a new
“green” standard by which our operations are run, including new gym environment and temperature set
points; upgrades to LED lighting specification; control systems for better management of heating,
ventilation and air conditioning and, in some cases and where feasible, on-site renewable power
generation. A structured implementation program is underway with the objective of delivering
improved energy performance and broader environmental impact across our estate throughout 2023.
We are also continuing to develop measures of performance, targets and specific objectives for each of
the other emerging themes.

Our sustainability strategy approach to climate related risks and transition action plans are overseen by
the Risk and Sustainability Action Team (“RSAT”), which is chaired by our CEO and consists of our
Director of Strategic Sustainability and five other senior managers and executives. This committee
meets on at least a quarterly basis and oversees a prioritized program of work to address our key issues.

127


-----

The RSAT is further supported by external specialist advisers from time to time to ensure we are subject
to appropriate objective external challenges and contributions.

The RSAT reports, in writing, to the Board on a regular basis and the Board conducts an annual review
of our S-ESG strategy, progress and performance. In order to monitor our S-ESG strategy, the RSAT
prepared a climate risk register, which is regularly reviewed, and is developing S-ESG key performance
indicators. For additional details on our sustainability initiatives, see “—Sustainability, Environment,
_Social and Governance (S-ESG).”_

**History**

The Company was established in September 2008 by entrepreneur Peter Roberts, who recognized that
there was a significant opportunity in the UK health and fitness market for a value gym offering. Peter
launched PureGym to disrupt the market by providing high quality exercise facilities to a broad
consumer base at affordable prices and on flexible contract terms.

In November 2009, the first two PureGyms were opened in Manchester and Leeds, with a third gym
opened in Edinburgh in December 2009. We built upon the success of our first three gyms and opened
six new gyms in 2010. Since 2010, we have increased the pace of roll-out of new gyms, growing from
nine gyms in 2010 to 582 gyms, including corporate-owned and franchise operated gyms, as of June 30,
2023, representing a CAGR of 39.6%. See “—Estate Overview—United Kingdom.”

In 2013, we were acquired by CCMP Capital Advisors, LP.

In January 2015, Humphrey Cobbold, formerly the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Wiggle, an
online cycling goods retailer, joined as our CEO.

In May 2015, we acquired the LA Fitness Group and its 43 LA Fitness and LAX branded gyms, making
us the number one gym by number of sites members in the UK. Subsequent to the acquisition, we
divested or closed 12 LA Fitness gyms while retaining 31 LA Fitness gyms and, in September 2017,
we completed the conversion of all 31 of the LA Fitness gyms to the PureGym format. In May 2015,
we also were assigned seven leases from Virgin Active.

In November 2017, LGP bought a majority stake our business.

In January 2018, we were the first ever UK gym to have over 1.0 million members.

In June 2018, we acquired Ovalhouse Limited (trading as Soho Gyms) consisting of 10 fitness clubs
based in prime locations throughout London. Four of the ten gyms were converted into the PureGym
model in 2018, five Soho Gyms were converted in the first half of 2019.

In September 2018, Alex Wood joined as the new Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

In November 2019, we entered into our first lease in the United States with the aim of testing our
low-cost, technology-enabled concept in a new international territory and we opened the first three
gyms in the United States in 2022 under the PureFitness brand.

On January 14, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Fitness World Group. The acquisition resulted
in us becoming a diversified value gym operator, which, upon the acquisition, made us, by the number
of gyms, the number two value gym operator in Europe, the number one gym operator in Denmark and
the number one value-based gym in Switzerland. We began the conversion of Fitness World and Basefit
gyms to the PureGym brand in 2021. The conversion is substantively complete, and we expect to fully
complete the conversion in 2023.

In April 2020, we entered into a franchise agreement with the Al Hokair Group, a well-established,
locally-listed family-run business in Saudi Arabia with extensive property, hotel, hospitality experience
(including partnerships with Hilton, IHG and IWG), to develop 40 sites over five years, and our first
franchise sites opened in October 2021 in Saudi Arabia.

128


-----

On 15 December 2020, we sold our Polish subsidiary, Fitness World sp. z o. o. (which we acquired in
January 2020 as part of the Fitness World Group) following a strategic decision by us to withdraw from
the Polish market.

In January 2022, we received a £300 million equity investment from KKR Fitness Aggregator L.P.
through the issuance of convertible preferred equity shares of Pinnacle Topco Limited.

In January 2022, we partnered with Vitality Health UK.

In September 2022, a regional development agreement was signed with Al Hokair Group in Saudi
Arabia to expand up to 130 franchise sites across the Middle East.

In the first quarter of 2023, we opened our first two franchise sites in the United Arab Emirates opened,
under our franchise agreement with the Al Hokair Group.

**Estate Overview**

_Corporate-owned_

Since opening our first gym in 2009, our estate has grown rapidly. In 2009, our estate consisted of three
gyms with 12,000 members. By 2022, we had over 550 gyms with approximately 1.7 million members
and, as of June 30, 2023, we had 566 gyms with approximately 1.9 million members.

Given our rapid roll-out, our estate has varying numbers of Mature Gyms and New Gyms throughout
the reporting period. The following table sets out the number of such gyms as of the dates indicated.

**As of December 31,** **As of June 30,**

**2020[(1)]** **2021** **2022** **2023**

Mature Gyms .............................................................................. 424 466 476 474

New Gyms .................................................................................. 68 43 70 92

**Total Gyms ................................................................................** **492** **509** **546** **566**

(1) In 2020, two UK sites underwent a period of extended closure (due to flooding and landlord works) followed by full refurbishment and
have therefore been recategorized from Mature to New Gyms. In addition, in 2020, 13 sites were closed as part of our estate optimization
plan in Denmark, four of these sites reopened after an extensive refurbishment and have therefore been recategorized from Mature
Gyms to New Gyms.

(2) In 2022, five sites in Denmark were transferred from one location to another and have therefore been recategorized from Mature Gyms
to New Gyms.

_Franchised_

In 2021, we launched a franchise model in the Middle East, with the first franchised sites opening in
Saudi Arabia. In 2023, the franchise expanded to a second country in the Middle East with the first two
sites opening in the United Arab Emirates. As of December 31, 2022, we had a franchise gym estate of
nine sites and, as of June 30, 2023, we had a franchise gym estate of 16 sites across the Middle East
excluding gyms in pre-sale.

**Gym locations**

We operate fitness clubs in the UK, Denmark, Switzerland, the United States and, through our
franchisee, the Middle East. The following table sets forth the number of gyms by country as of June 30,
2023.

129


-----

**As of**

**June 30, 2023**

**Number of**

**Gyms**

United Kingdom .......................................................................................................................................... **352**

Denmark ...................................................................................................................................................... **168**

Switzerland .................................................................................................................................................. **43**

United States ............................................................................................................................................... 3

Middle East ................................................................................................................................................. 16

**Total ............................................................................................................................................................** **582**

Our gyms are located in towns, cities and other populous areas, and we have a balanced portfolio of
gyms throughout our European markets, including a strong presence in the London area, Copenhagen
and Zurich. Our model has proven successful in a wide variety of property types, such as former retail
park warehouses, grocery stores, offices, car showrooms, basements, factories and nightclubs and
demographic catchments, which we believe indicates that there are a significant number of site
alternatives that can be selected for future gyms.

We have opened, and intend to continue opening, new gyms in certain areas where we already operate
a gym (or gyms) and where we believe there is sufficient demand for additional gyms. We believe that
this strengthens our membership proposition over our competitors by providing members with the
flexibility and convenience to use multiple gyms (e.g., near both home and work) and strengthening the
local brand.

**Gym format and size**

Our gyms generally have the following key characteristics and components:

- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year gym access, which allows our members to
adapt their use of the gym to fit their individual lifestyles;

- a large number and wide range of high quality, award-winning gym equipment from leading
manufacturers, including Matrix, Precor, BLK Box and Technogym;

- one or two dedicated studio fitness areas, including in many cases dedicated stationary cycling
studios, which enable each gym to offer approximately 50 face-to-face classes per week;

- sports water dispensing machines and vending machines;

- self-cleaning and hand-sanitizing stations;

- clean and well-appointed shower and changing facilities as well as disabled access, disabled toilets
and shower facilities;

- two to four fully-automated PIN and RFID tag- or QR code-controlled entry portals, speed gates
or turnstiles for secure member access;

- free Wi-Fi internet access complemented by 4/5G where available and a professional sound
system;

- continuously recording CCTV security cameras, proactively managed and monitored by our
in-house team during non-peak hours; and

- at least one member of staff, a fitness professional or a member of the cleaning team, who is trained
in first aid, present for the majority of the hours of operation as well as CCTV monitoring when
gym sites are unmanned.

We tailor our gym format to local market conditions to offer the best possible member experience. As
a result, in addition to the common features described above, certain gyms may have specific features,

130


-----

such as “ladies only” areas or a bigger focus on plate loaded, free weights and fixed pin areas with
smaller cardio and functional areas or vice versa. Our gyms do not have cafes, saunas, steam rooms,
spas or pools, which are typically used by a small percentage of gym members. These amenities result
in higher operating and Initial Capital Investment costs, while lowering the amount of high-utilization
gym floor space, which limits the number of members gyms can support.

Our gyms vary in size since our operational model is highly adaptable to both large and small spaces,
which allows us to serve members across a broad range of catchments. Our small box format gyms are
typically in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 square feet and generally have 1,800 to 2,200 members with a
typical market catchment of 10,000 to 25,000 (as compared to 10,000 to 12,000 square feet and 12,000
to 22,000 square feet, 2,800 to 3,400 members and 4,000 to 6,000 members and catchments of 15,000
to 35,000 and 30,000 plus, for medium box and large box format gyms respectively, in each case). The
small box format gyms enable us to grow into areas that would not otherwise support a larger sized
gym.

**Fitness equipment**

Our gyms are equipped with a broad range of high-quality fitness equipment primarily consisting of
cardiovascular and resistance equipment such as treadmills, climb mills, cross trainers, stationary bikes
and fixed resistance weight machines. In addition, our gyms are equipped with an extensive free weights
section, as well as other specialized training equipment such as functional rigs, kettlebells, TRX bands,
battle ropes, medicine balls and foam rollers. The majority of our gyms also have stationary exercise
bikes for cycling classes, as well as functional training zones, which targets an area of fitness that has
significantly grown in popularity recently. We monitor the latest exercise and fitness trends as well as
consumer dynamics in our gyms in order to make a decision regarding changes to our gym equipment.
For example, in gyms where we seek to attract a younger demographic, we have added in an expanded
free weights area and tailored group classes. Data analysis is also used for optimization of a specific
piece of equipment to its designated zone.

We only select equipment we believe to be high quality and designed for heavy and frequent use. A
majority of our cardiovascular and resistance equipment is supplied by either Matrix, Precor or
Technogym, depending on the gym location, whilst our free weights and functional accessories are
supplied by BLK Box or Jordan Fitness. Our M&A Conversion gyms are also equipped with other
third-party suppliers. We believe that purchasing high quality equipment results in an improved member
experience, reduces maintenance expenditure and ensures a longer equipment lifecycle.

The specific fitness equipment installed in each gym is designed for each space based on management’s
view of expected utilization allowing for geographic, demographic and other factors. Gym equipment
is generally installed in phases. At opening, a base level of equipment is installed in each gym. This
base level can then be increased if membership begins to substantially increase above expectation and
actual usage patterns are observed and analyzed. This is part of our capital efficient fit-out strategy and
ensures that we are able to tailor our product offering at the local level.

We are focused on maintaining the high quality of our gym equipment in order to provide our members
with a compelling in-gym experience. As such, we have comprehensive fitness equipment and
maintenance programs with our suppliers who are contracted to repair any non-functioning piece of
equipment within specified timeframes, as well as employees who are able to serve as technicians in
certain locations. We have a six to ten year replacement cycle for most equipment items over which
time the equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
_of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

**Other fitness services**

Our gyms aim to offer a varied product offering, including at our small box format gyms. For example,
the majority of our gyms offer the opportunity for members to buy personal training sessions delivered
by professionally qualified fitness professionals. We aim to attract fitness professionals who are

131


-----

passionate about fitness and who specialize in specific areas such as sports therapy, injury rehabilitation,
nutrition and strength and conditioning. Additionally, our gyms typically have one or two dedicated
group exercise studios per gym, including cycling studios fitted out with purpose built stationary bikes.
Each gym generally offers approximately 50 face-to-face classes per week taught by qualified fitness
professionals. In some gyms, video/virtual classes are also offered in the gym and are accessible at any
time for members of those gyms. Members are able to book places in studio classes seven to fourteen
days in advance using the PureGym mobile app, our website or in-gym kiosks.

We believe that dedicated studio areas and a large fitness class offering attract a broader demographic
of members, enhance member satisfaction and offer greater utilization of space during peak times. Most
of our gyms also offer a varying range of services as bolt-on membership options, such as priority class
booking, access to a digital body composition tracker and sports water. In addition, our members have
access to workouts, nutritional advice, progress tracking and training plans through the PureGym app.
Our apps provide all members with numerous virtual classes available for free download for use ingym or at home. We believe these additional fitness services differentiate us from many of our
competitors in the value gym market.

**Members**

**_Overview_**

We are the largest operator of gyms in the UK by number of sites and members and the second largest
gym and fitness operator in Europe by number of sites, with approximately 1,855,000 members as of
June 30, 2023 across our estate. Our customer value proposition is based on providing members with
affordable, flexible and value for money access to a national network of high-quality and
well-maintained gyms. As a result of our affordable price point, strong value for money offer and
“everybody welcome” philosophy and marketing message, we attract a broad range of consumers, from
a wide variety of demographic and socio-economic backgrounds. many of whom have not been
members of a gym previously due to high prices or the lack of flexibility and value in the offering. We
also attract many members from traditional health club operators because of our compelling product
offer and lower price points. We believe these factors will continue to resonate even more with
consumers in a post-COVID-19 world with more flexible working and lifestyle patterns.

**_Membership Tenure_**

Our business model resonates strongly with members and has resulted in member loyalty and a growing
average member tenure. For example, Average Continuous Membership Tenure in the UK for the 269
clubs open on January 1, 2021 was 16.5 months as of June 30, 2023, which is longer than a typical
one-year gym contract. Average tenure has been increasing over time, up from 15 months as of
June 2022 to 16.5 months in June 2023 as illustrated in the following chart:

132


-----

Average membership tenure in Denmark and Switzerland is longer than the UK, 37 months and 26
months respectively.

The graph below sets forth a breakdown of the percentage of members by band of continuous
membership tenure of our gyms in the UK as of the dates shown.

Many members who terminate their memberships later return. Of our UK members that left in 2019
and 2020, 39% later re-joined. We believe our members have a lower than average likelihood of
membership cancellation in the next twelve months when compared to our competitors, and that our
long, continuous membership tenure and retention of former members is a testament to our strong
customer proposition.

Our high level of monthly member value retention, which was between 90% and 95% between
January 2022 and June 2023 in the UK, is supported by offering increased premiumization options

133


-----

throughout a member’s lifetime, proactive revenue management and high retention rates among our
premium members.

As of June 30, 2023, average UK member lifetime value is £322. However, UK members in the
continuous membership length of 18 months or more, which grew approximately 7% year-over-year as
of June 30, 2023, have an average membership lifetime value of £792 (Source: Company information).

**_Membership Offerings_**

Key to our proposition is the simple and transparent “no contract” flexible membership. In our model,
most members are not bound to any fixed term contract or commitment and simply pay on a monthly
basis in advance for their membership, almost entirely by direct debit (first payments are typically made
by card). Members have the ability to freeze or leave at any time, which provides flexibility that appeals
to a broad cross-section of potential members in the market.

The “Core” membership product provides unlimited access to a member’s chosen gym. In addition to
this “Core” membership, we offer a number of additional membership options. We offer discounted
“Off Peak” memberships in many gyms, where access is restricted to quieter times (such as on weekends
and/or in the middle of the day) so pricing is lower. In addition, members can choose to pay a higher
fee and select premium membership options such as “Multi,” “Plus” or “Premium” which provide
additional benefits, such as being able to access more than one gym, bringing a guest along to work out
with, priority class bookings or entitlement to additional services, such as sports water, nutritional
products, body composition monitoring and/or massage beds in some gyms. These options provide
members with a range of flexibility to tailor their membership to best suit their personal needs. This
also assists us in optimizing revenue across gyms to leverage our nationwide footprint and optimize
value-added sales since, for example, each Plus membership sold in the UK earns us an extra £5 to £10
per month. As of June 30, 2023, in the UK, 58% of members held “Core” memberships, 9% held “Off
Peak” memberships, 29% held premium options and 4% held other products such as student
memberships.

In addition to rolling monthly memberships, we sell fixed term memberships (for example 12 months),
paid upfront. These are popular with certain member segments like students and are popular in
Switzerland because they are the way that people are used to paying for gym membership. We also sell
shorter term “day passes” which can be bought (at a slightly higher price) to access facilities for specific
one, three, seven, or 30 days at a time. This is a useful “trial” option for prospects or a good option for
people who travel regularly. These short-term “day pass” options do not form part of the membership
count.

**_Membership pricing_**

We have invested significant resources in revenue management and operate a dynamic pricing strategy
across our estate with pricing set at gym specific level, reflecting the variability of local catchments.
This is a key strategic differentiator to many other value gym operators. Gym pricing is transparent on
our website and mobile apps and is a core component of our affordable value proposition, which also
differentiates us from traditional mid-market and premium health and fitness operators.

Pricing is managed centrally and is reviewed frequently by senior management, incorporating a
sophisticated range of data alongside feedback from local and regional management. The goal of this
dynamic variable pricing is to optimize revenue and consequently site profitability through the effective
balancing of yield, volume and capacity in order to ensure member experience is also optimized.
Internal and external factors are considered in pricing decisions to ensure site potential is realized from
inception through to maturity.

**_Member engagement and satisfaction_**

We believe that regular, relevant engagement with members results in a better customer experience and
inspires members to use the gym more frequently and achieve their fitness goals. Higher satisfaction

134


-----

and more active gym usage in turn typically increases membership duration and leads to
recommendations to family, friends, and relatives. We seek to engage with our current members in a
number of ways. On a personal level, gym managers and fitness professionals are encouraged to develop
relationships with members and support the achievement of their fitness goals. We also use technology
to engage with customers and educate them about fitness. See “—Technology.” We also seek to engage
with former members and encourage them to return to our gyms through email or in-app messaging.

Achieving high levels of customer satisfaction is our key objective and management tracks satisfaction
levels closely. We gather feedback from members largely through regular estate-wide, Net Promoter
Score monitoring at club level alongside additional feedback mechanisms. We use the results in all
levels of decision-making, including operations, product design, pricing, site fit-out and maintenance.
Customer feedback scores are also used as a component of the incentive and bonus awards for gym
managers and senior gym employees.

**Access**

The majority of our gyms in the UK are accessible by members seven days a week, 365 days a year and
24/7 opening is due to be expanded across much of the estate in Switzerland as well. In Denmark,
opening hours are typically 5:00 AM or 6:00 AM to midnight and this is considered to be optimal for
that market. Entry and exit are controlled via automated and computer-controlled entry portals, speed
gates or turnstiles and members have their own unique PIN-codes and/or RFID bands or key fobs,
tokens or membership cards, which grant them access. Fraud prevention measures are in place to limit
the risk of multiple individuals using the same membership or PIN number. The automated entry
systems track and provide data on usage patterns so that gym managers can actively manage capacity
and monitor key performance indicators. See “—Other fitness services.”

**Property**

We have had a strong pipeline of new organic corporate-owned gyms: we opened 40 new locations in
2019 (all in the UK), 17 new locations in 2020 (12 in the UK and five in Denmark), 25 new locations
in 2021 (23 in the UK and one in each of Denmark and Switzerland), 45 new locations in 2022 (40 in
the UK and two in Switzerland and three in the US), 22 new locations in the six months ended June 30,
2023 (20 in the UK and two in Switzerland). In general, new gyms are performing well.

As we open new corporate sites, our LTM Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA continues to increase and has
increased quarter over quarter to £128 million as of June 30, 2023 from £108 million as of June 30,
2022.

We are targeting to open approximately 45 organic corporate-owned gyms in 2023, including a further
20 in the UK and 3 in Switzerland, and are targeting an organic roll-out of over 300 new corporateowned locations in the UK in the medium to longer-term. For 2023 and 2024/25, 34 new sites are
already legally committed and 3 further sites, which are due to open in 2023, have been Board approved.
This includes 23 sites legally committed or Board approved for opening in the second half of 2023, and
a further 14 sites are legally committed across 2024 and 2025, which are all well distributed across the
UK (including sites in the Midlands, South East, North East, North West, South West and Wales,
Greater London, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and Switzerland, as well as a further 39 sites in the
pipeline for 2024. We believe the full potential of existing, committed and pipeline sites under
negotiation provides visibility to at least £155 million Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA, including
embedded EBITDA from new corporate gym openings of £9 million from the six months ended
December 31, 2023, £5 million from legally committed new sites due to open in 2024 and 2025 and
£13 million from sites in the pipeline for 2024, but not yet legally committed, as well as other synergies.

_Our targets for embedded EBITDA and Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on the assumption that_
_we are successful in implementing all of our currently planned initiatives, including the opening of new_
_corporate and franchise gyms, and that all of our planned initiatives will be successful in generating_
_the embedded EBITDA targets as well as other synergies that we currently anticipate, and both our_

135

_targets and other assumptions underlying such targets are based on our current estimates, perceptions,_
_expectations and intentions, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause_
_actual results or performance to be materially different from anticipated future results or performance_
_expressed or implied by such targets and assumptions. See ‘‘Risk Factors—The unaudited financial_
_data and projections included herein need to be carefully considered and incorporate forward-looking_
_estimates that may differ from actual results” and “Risk Factors—Certain non IFRS measures such as_
_Run Rate Adjusted EBITDA incorporate forward looking estimates that may differ from actual results”._

We believe that we have developed a rigorous, transparent and professional approach to identifying
new sites and to guiding decision-making over capital investment. We also believe that the discipline
of our property acquisition process, combined with the institutional knowledge gained from opening
more gyms than any other private, low-cost gym operator in the UK since 2009 and any other gym
operator in Denmark since 2005, is a major contributor to our significant growth, competitive advantage
and success. In addition, we believe the power of our UK property acquisition team and process is
evidenced by the fact that our UK Mature Gyms delivered an Average Gym ROCE of 35% in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2023.

Our overall strategic objective is to secure and develop gyms at properties that are well located,
contribute to positive “cluster effects” and deliver attractive and sustainable returns on invested capital.
A structured and disciplined approach has been crucial for successful site acquisition and has helped us
build a strong nationwide site portfolio. We have a four-stage new site acquisition process, which
includes: (1) Initial Site Targeting; (2) Preliminary Screening of Opportunities; (3) Detailed Evaluation
and Assessment of Priorities; and (4) Formal Feasibility Reports and Investment Decision Making (as
described below). Our rigorous approach to site selection, which includes approval of all new sites by
the Group Capex Committee (including the CEO and CFO) and requires a ROCE feasibility target of
over 30%, is designed to ensure a high-quality pipeline across all geographies. Although the process
sometimes varies by geography, our intention is to standardize the process across all jurisdictions over
time. We lease all of our gym sites.

**_The Property Acquisition Team_**

We have dedicated property acquisition teams that are responsible for identifying potential targets and
consistently tracking local competitor new site openings. The property acquisition teams leverage their
extensive property experience, their credibility with landlords and their strong relationships with local
real-estate agents to negotiate the best possible rental deals, as well as having strong relationships with
landlords, developers, agents and other gym operators and retailers who may be looking to divest sites.
The property acquisition teams use multiple site identification methods to identify potential targets and
establish potential hurdles for each location, with a focus on membership potential at each site. The
teams are also responsible for detailed site criteria and specifications. For example, in the UK, over
1,000 core locations are being tracked and assessed, approximately 400 locations are under active
analysis and investigation and approximately 100 are in negotiation.

**_Initial Site Targeting_**

The responsibilities of our property acquisition teams include identifying potential site locations,
evaluating their suitability, developing financial forecasts for prospective sites in conjunction with the
operations, finance and development teams and negotiating lease terms with landlords. The property
acquisition teams use extensive data and proprietary tools to identify and evaluate new gym sites. We
use a number of approaches to ensure we are identifying a large number and broad cross section of
potential new locations for our gyms, such as working with external consultants to build a proprietary
postcode driven assessment model to help it identify potentially attractive locations using demographic,
socio-economic and other data.

136


-----

**_Preliminary Screening of Opportunities_**

Given the number of locations and opportunities that we identify, we have developed a disciplined and
efficient approach to screening opportunities focusing on six key evaluation parameters, including site
characteristics, headline population and demographic characteristics, likely lease terms, location
characteristics, local competitive dynamics and other important local considerations.

**_Detailed Evaluation and Assessment of Priorities_**

After the initial screening phase, we perform more detailed evaluations of potential sites, including
steps such as creating financial forecasts and returns models and performing an analysis of potential
impact on existing sites if relevant.

**_Formal Feasibility Report and Investment Decision-Making_**

If a site is deemed to be attractive following the detailed evaluation, a formal feasibility report is
prepared. The work and documentation for these reports is standardized and they are prepared by the
property acquisition team. If the Group Capex Committee approves a formal feasibility report, the lease
for the site will be entered into, unless the circumstances change in the intervening period.

**_Site Development_**

Once a lease for a new site has been entered into, our development teams take responsibility for
managing the construction of the gym. We have robust processes, a proprietary data set of benchmark
costs, and very strong contractor and supplier relationships to assist in the development of sites. These
factors continue to be a major contributor to our strong growth, competitive advantage and success.

**_Gym opening targets and pipeline_**

We believe that we have a substantial advantage over competitors for acquiring leased space given our
strong brand, leading market positions, historically strong landlord covenant, excellent reputation and
proven ability to drive footfall to landlords’ properties. We believe that there is a market opportunity to
double the size of our business in the medium term, largely in our existing operating countries. This
would provide approximately 800 to 1,100 gyms.

**_Property leases_**

We seek to enter economically feasible leases with sufficient length of term to justify the development
costs of gyms. In addition, we also seek to ensure that our leases protect us from substantial increases
in rents due to potential future volatility in the commercial property market and provide it with sufficient
flexibility to exit unprofitable locations. Our organic site lease agreements typically include our
standard key terms, which provide us with substantial visibility over our future property costs, such as
10-to-15-year terms, tenant-only break rights at year ten and limits on rent increase parameters.

**Franchise Model**

In 2021, we launched our franchise model. The aim of this model is for us to take our affordable,
accessible gym proposition to markets with limited current access to such facilities and provides an
exciting platform to expand the business’ reach to other territories. Our franchise model allows us to
develop our estate network across other areas of the world, through leveraging our core intellectual
property and optimized operating model, as well as create value through low-capital-intensive EBITDA
growth. Through our franchise model, we aim to partner with credible, expert local partners who have
access to capital and the resources to build a leading market position, are well connected with landlords
and are experienced in real estate, have a business presence in the region and have a strong cultural and
legislative knowledge of the region.

Through our franchise model, we offer franchise partners the opportunity to gain access to our worldclass brand and operating model, including through leveraging our tech-enabled operations such as our

137


-----

website, apps and member management system, our operational experts, our in-house real estate experts
and our marketing team. In turn, we are able to redeploy franchise revenue into our corporate-owned
sites. In addition to our operating model being attractive to members, our operating model is attractive
for franchisee operators because our proven format is adaptable to a wide range of site sizes, property
markets and population concentrations, is digitally enabled (allowing for a low cost per acquisition) and
has been shown to work with low personnel costs.

We intend to selectively expand the number of franchised sites in existing franchise markets as well as
entering new markets, in order to increase revenues and broaden our reach with limited capital
requirement. We believe there are a number of markets, particularly the United States, as well as South
Korea, Japan, South East Asia and ASEAN and India, where we could be successful based on our
understanding of the local competitive landscape and the potential for a branded low-cost, high value
gym operator in these markets. We believe that current and prospective franchise partners can launch
approximately 400 franchised sites by 2028 throughout the globe.

In 2022, we entered into a regional development agreement with the Al Hokair Group to develop a
minimum of 130 sites across the Middle East. As of June 30, 2023, we had 16 franchised sites currently
in operation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, excluding sites in presale. We believe that in the fullness of
time the Middle Eastern franchise opportunity could be up to 300 sites.

In 2022, we opened our first three gyms in the United States and under the brand PureFitness, which
are corporate owned, with the aim of testing our low-cost, technology-enabled concept in a new
international territory. Having successfully tested our three corporate-owned gyms, we are now seeking
five to ten operating partners, with potential for at least 100 sites, as franchisees in the U.S. over the
next five years who will expand our footprint across the US.

**Seasonality**

We experience a small degree of seasonality. The key months for membership growth are
January/February and August/September/October. Seasonality is generally positively driven by
consumers’ desire to improve their fitness at the start of the year and the start of new university/school
terms and negatively impacted by Christmas and summer holidays. Marketing spend is generally
increased during peak joining periods, particularly the January/February period.

**Marketing**

Our “everybody welcome” philosophy and marketing message positions us as an affordable provider
of high-quality health and fitness facilities that welcome all people regardless of their current levels of

138


-----

fitness or fitness goals. Our marketing message and brand image focus on our position as a leading
value gym provider, evidenced by our affordable and transparent pricing, flexible membership options
and convenient 24-hours-a-day (where available), seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year access to a
national network of clean and well-maintained gyms that house high-quality equipment and offer a
large number of free exercise classes.

We operate national, regional, and local/site-specific marketing campaigns and programs, and we
believe we have best-in-class national, digital and local marketing consideration and purchase. Total
marketing expenditure for the Group was £14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, £23.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and £12.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2023. Both the efficiency and effectiveness of this expenditure are important focus areas for senior
management and marketing spend by channel is actively managed to drive results and minimize
customer acquisition costs. Considerable focus and attention are placed on local advertising campaigns
for gyms that are in the pre-opening phase or have recently opened. Approximately £36,000 is budgeted
for each new gym opening to support advertising in order to build high local awareness ahead of and
around the time of the opening date.

Our local, regional and national campaigns primarily consist of online marketing, targeted door drops,
hand to hand marketing through leaflets, out-of-home advertisements, linear and VOD TV
advertisements, and paid-search platforms such as Google. We believe that as a market-leading gym
operator, we have substantial marketing advantages as compared to other operators in our key markets,
particularly with regards to our ability to cost effectively pursue national brand awareness building
campaigns. In the past, we have also made effective use of sporting celebrities ambassadors, such as Sir
Chris Hoy and Dina Asher-Smith, to differentiate the brand, increase recall and build credibility. The
critical focus of our marketing is low-cost, high-volume customer acquisition. The aim is to generate
relevant low-cost traffic, convert traffic to joiners and maximize ROI through real-time analysis. Our
low average cost per member acquisition of £7 to £8 for the Group is a key component of low operating
cost and healthy margins.

We monitor the visibility and preference of our brand on a quarterly basis. In March 2023, our national
UK brand awareness stood at 83%, almost twice the level of the closest value-gym competitor and
leading in the whole of the UK gym sector, as shown in the graph below.

**Technology**

Technology is a critical component of our business model. We use technology to enhance our customer
value proposition and augment the membership experience, while simultaneously using it to drive

139


-----

operating and capital cost efficiencies and enable the senior management team to better manage the
business.

For members, technology enables convenient and easy online joining and membership management as
well as 24-hours-a-day (where available), seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year access to many of our
gyms. Customers can sign up for memberships via our websites and PureGym mobile apps. Members
can also use our websites and mobile apps to book places in exercise classes, manage their membership
status and follow workout plans.

In addition to enhancing the proposition, our technology infrastructure enables us to lower operating
costs and more efficiently run our business. For example, we use an online member management system
provided and hosted by eXerp to process new memberships, update member information and store
member data. The eXerp system interfaces with the Gantner gym access system, which controls gym
access for members via PIN, RFID wristband, key fob and QR code scanning via the mobile app. These
systems allow all of our gyms to operate without a staffed reception, with our Swiss gyms to be fully
integrated into the eXerp system by the end of 2023. Our online joining process also allows us to operate
without an expensive in-gym sales force. In addition to joining, many aspects of a customer’s
membership can be managed by members online or via the PureGym mobile apps such planning a visit
based on gym capacity, as booking places in classes or upgrading, tracking gym activities, transferring
and freezing memberships. We believe our online membership management services are highly
differentiated in the global health and fitness market.

Technology is also used to reduce fit out and maintenance costs. For example, equipment heat maps are
developed in partnership with suppliers and used to configure newly opened gyms to reduce wear and
tear on equipment and provide equipment utilization reports. We have also developed and use a
proprietary capacity management tool, which allows it to track and monitor the capacity of gyms and
identify bottlenecks at different stages of the member journey. Eliminating these bottlenecks allows
gyms to support higher levels of membership.

We have invested substantially in our internal IT capabilities and have brought a number of core IT
functions in-house. Our IT team is led by our Group Chief Information Officer with a team of 85
permanent full-time employees. The role of the IT team is to drive value out of current and future
technology investments and work alongside the other business areas to explore new opportunities and
support growth. We believe that direct ownership of, and control over, our core technology interface
with members and business partners is a source of competitive advantage for the company.

Individual gyms have IT infrastructures to provide local access network service, provide free Wi-Fi to
members (in most facilities) and ensure back-up PIN and access data for the site. All gyms in the UK
(and an increasing number across Denmark and Switzerland) are equipped with continuously recording
closed-circuit television security cameras. These are proactively monitored outside of normal staffing
hours by an in-house team and video is recorded at each access control point for fraud detection and
prevention.

Our back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of technologies designed to assist in the
management and analysis of our revenue, costs and key operational metrics as well as support the daily
operations of our office-based and remotely located staff. These include an in-house developed business
intelligence system and a third-party hosted financial system.

Our information technology strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans.
We maintain an ongoing comprehensive program to replace or upgrade key systems, enhance security
and optimize performance. We believe that our IT systems are scalable and can support our growth
plans.

We have always prioritized providing a safe working and training environment at our gyms for
colleagues and members, and we have built upon this policy further during the pandemic in order to
provide a robust COVID-19-secure space. Our investment in technology, both frontline and back-office,

140


-----

plays a critical role in maintaining this safe environment. Our enhanced capabilities in response to the
pandemic include integrated club and home fitness services such as live and on-demand classes,
nutritional advice and progress tracking; self-cleaning stations; “live” feeds of attendance and member
feedback for monitoring and control; and tools to support members in timing visits, bookings slots and
contactless entry.

Our digital products and services are very highly rated by consumers with the PureGym UK app rated
4.5 or higher out of 5 in the Apple and Android app stores and regularly competing for top ten
positioning of fitness apps, including with apps such as Strava and Fitbit. As of July 31, 2023, the UK
app has been installed on over 5.5 million devices with almost 900,000 active users each month. In the
second half of 2023, our apps in Denmark and Switzerland will be migrated to the UK model/standard.

**Information Back-Up and Disaster Recovery**

We fully back up all of our membership and business information using third party data locations and
have a full business continuity plan in place. Our contracts with third party technology systems will
typically require that they are backed up regularly, with frequency varying depending on the third party
supplier.

**Suppliers**

We outsource a number of functions of our business to third parties, which allows us to optimize fixed
costs, maintain lean staff levels and scale rapidly. Services outsourced include maintenance and repair
of fitness equipment, construction of new gyms, maintenance and repair of fixtures and fittings,
cleaning, some human resources advice and support and various other professional services.

Due to our market-leading positions in our key health and fitness markets, we are able to purchase
equipment, supplies and services on a larger scale than most of our competitors, which we believe
allows us to purchase at lower prices and benefit from the wider Group scale. Our procurement is
centrally managed by the Group Procurement Director. We have good relationships with our key
suppliers and service providers, including our main suppliers of fitness equipment, Matrix and BLK
Box.

**Intellectual Property**

We own registered trademarks in the UK, Ireland and Europe in respect of the PURE GYM name and
logo in various classes of goods and services including fitness-related categories. We also own a
registered trademark in the UK for a logo embodying our tagline “everybody welcome” in several
classes of services. Additionally, we have the registered “Purefitness” trademark in the U.S.

We have proactively obtained trademarks in certain countries in Asia. We pursue registration of our
trademarks in select international jurisdictions where we use or are intending to use the marks and are
continuously monitoring potential international jurisdictions for trademark registration to the extent
they become relevant. We seek to proactively oppose and take prompt action with respect to any
unauthorized use of our marks of which we become aware.

**Insurance**

We maintain global insurance policies customary in the industry and in line with our risk profiles. The
principal risks covered by our insurance policies are public and employer liability, asset risks, business
interruption, directors & officers, travel, fleet, crime, cyber and terrorism. Our insurance policies are
undergoing renewal such that our policies are expected to be replaced mid-October 2023, in line with
the current expiration of our current policies.

141


-----

**Sustainability, Environment, Social and Governance (S-ESG)**

In 2021, we recognized the need to formalize our approach to sustainability and embed sustainability
into our core mission and business model. In taking strides to become an industry leader in sustainability
we appointed a Director of Strategic Sustainability to help facilitate the design and implementation of
our sustainability system including strategy development, goal setting, action planning, and highquality reporting and disclosures in accordance with global standards.

We completed a materiality assessment to identify and evaluate the ESG issues which were most
material to our business and assessed these against the likely impact that those areas had on the business
and our strategic direction. In consultation with our four main stakeholder groups: employees, investors,
supply chain partners and members, we identified the following focus areas to develop our S-ESG
Strategy:

- _Delivering Social Good—supporting as many people as possible to live healthier lives;_

- _Empowering People—fostering a thriving healthy team and community where everyone feels_
welcome and supported to reach their potential;

- _Energy and Emissions—reducing our carbon footprint and efficient use of resources;_

- _Waste & Circulatory—minimizing operational waste and embedding circular-by-design principles_
across our operations; and

- _Effective Corporate Governance—building an environment of trust, transparency and_
accountability for sustainable performance.

We are committed to ensuring our S-ESG agenda is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (“UN SDGs”) so as to create meaningful links to broader global sustainably-driven
outcomes including specific measures of performance, targets and objectives. Furthermore, we believe
we are compliant or on a path to compliance with the principles arising from Regulation (EU)
2019/2088, the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation.

We are a purpose-led business deeply rooted in our mission to provide a meaningful and valued service
to society and to help people make a positive difference to their lives through being more physically
active: by its nature, our business furthers the social good of helping people improve their physical and
mental health. By virtue of the low-price, no-contract and flexible business model, we believe have
opened up the opportunity for physical activity to many hundreds of thousands of people who would
otherwise have been excluded from such activity. The WHO is unequivocal in its support for the view
that even modest levels of activity are important to preserve the health of people of all ages. We
therefore believe that the considerable investments we have made over time have made a significant
positive difference to the physical and mental health of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.

In 2022, we became the official gym partner of The British Heart Foundation (the “BHF”). We are
committed to supporting the BHF in raising awareness of heart and circularity diseases, and how to
prevent them, as well as raising £3.0 million over the next three years to fund important research
projects. In December 2022, we were named BHF Corporate Partner of the Year.

Highlights from the first years of our partnership included:

- raising nearly £1 million for critical science-based research projects;

- supporting the development of the ‘Healthy Hearts Programme’ providing free access to
educational and practical tools to enable everybody to take control of their heart health;

- delivering CPR training through Group RevivR sessions for employees and members; and

142


-----

- donating 1.5 tons of pre-loved sportswear that would have otherwise gone to landfill, resulting in
a 0.5-ton reduction in CO2 emissions.

As is implicit in our “Everybody Welcome” approach, diversity, inclusion, and belonging (“DIBs”) is
a key part of our DNA and our high-value / low-cost model strives to promote equality and democratize
fitness. We believe that everyone has the right to be, and to feel, safe. Our goal is to create a safe and
positive space for everyone, so they can enjoy the benefits of fitness and wellbeing. Safety is the
cornerstone of a positive experience for our members and employees. Our emergency response and
anti-harassment protocols are best-in-class, and we continue to pioneer initiatives that make a positive
change to gym culture.

In terms of governance and participation in the business, we work to high standards, based around a
well-organized management structure and active employee engagement forums that encourage
equitable participation.

We have made concerted efforts to ensure we have a diverse and representative group of decisionmakers in each of its markets. 45% of our Executive Management Board which directs the business
across the Group are female (including our Group Managing Director) and at a country level, 43% of
the senior management boards in each market are female.

More broadly, our focus on gender balance and initiatives to increase the number of women in senior
roles is setting the tone for the gym industry and has resulted in a 0% median pay gap and 3.4% mean
pay gap in 2022.

Due to disruption in supply caused by the Russia and Ukraine conflict which commenced in February
of 2022, the 2022 energy crisis provided us with a particular opportunity to fast-track our energy
reduction and decarbonization plans. We have been working with a market leading operational
improvement consultant to identify and pursue opportunities to significantly reduce energy usage per
site. A structured implementation program is underway with the objective of delivering improved
energy performance and broader environmental impact across our estate throughout 2023.

We are focused on ways to manage, and reduce where possible, energy consumption in and the
environmental impact of our gyms and have placed emphasis on designing our gyms with a number of
energy saving and “green” features. The following is a selection of features that have been incorporated
throughout the estate, where practically possible:

- mechanical and electrical systems that comply with government energy-saving schemes, including
HMRC’s Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme for energy-saving technologies;

- LED energy-saving lighting and water-saving bathroom and shower facilities;

- energy-efficient fitness equipment, including treadmills, exercise bikes and other self-powered
cardio equipment that have display screens powered by batteries and user-generated electricity;

- control systems for management of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning;

- recycling the building materials from the fit out of our gyms; and

- in some cases, on-site renewable power generation.

Reducing our carbon emissions is the single most important thing that we can do to help slow down
global warming. We have reported on our GHG emissions since 2020 in accordance with our
Streamlined Energy & Carbon Reporting obligations. The forced shutdown of our estate due to COVID19 during 2020, and again in 2021, made it difficult for us to establish a meaningful baseline, a key
dependency for any organization making commitments and setting targets. The incorporation of
Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFDs”) into our annual reporting process for
the year ended December 31, 2023 will include expanded emissions reporting for our global operations

143


-----

and reporting on additional, categories such as supply chain. Reporting against the TCFDs is an
important step for us providing the necessary framework for climate-related disclosures and supporting
the incorporation of climate-related risk and opportunities into our risk management, strategic planning
and decision-making processes.

We are working towards making a carbon neutral and net zero commitment by the year ended
December 31, 2024. In the meantime, we will continue to deliver our energy efficiency program which
we anticipate will reduce Scope 2 emissions intensity per location by around 20% over the medium
term.

In terms of broader environmental considerations, it should be remembered that the nature of our
business is high volume throughput and high efficiency and therefore inherently sustainable in nature.
Because members effectively “rent” access to the gym facilities and equipment for the hours that they
need the equipment, utilization is high. The alternative is for people to buy their own equipment and
have it at a home, but such equipment would be very lightly utilized, making it a poor use of raw
materials and resources and therefore less sustainable. Gyms are effectively a part of the “sharing
economy” and, especially in the case of low cost/high volume gyms like ours, are a good, sustainable
use of resources.

Another social initiative of ours is the PureGym Trust. We have been able to set up an employee
hardship fund following generous donations from LGP during 2020 in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. The PureGym Trust continues to focus on supporting our employees who are facing
significant financial difficulties.

Furthermore, in order to foster an open and constructive culture, there are multiple routes for staff across
our whole business to communicate and raise issues with members of the senior management team. We
have a whistle-blowing policy in place in addition to a fully-equipped human resources team that
actively ensures there are alternative routes beyond line management through which staff can raise
concerns. During 2022, governance within our business has been strengthened with the implementation
of a new Enterprise Risk Management Framework across all major geographies. This has successfully
formalized the process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the
business. Furthermore, a number of new key roles have been appointed including a Group General
Counsel and Head of Internal Audit to strength our compliance and control environment. We also focus
on transparency and accuracy in tax and accounting matters, as well as having a policy of not making
political contributions or seeking to have undue influence in political matters.

**Health and Safety**

We recognize that the health and safety of our employees, members, associates and business partners is
of paramount importance and accordingly have adopted health and safety policies that comply with
applicable health and safety legislation. We believe that this ensures consistent application of our health
and safety policies across our estate.

We incorporate a number of features to ensure the health and safety of our members, staff, associates
and business partners. For example, we endeavor to ensure that our gyms always have an employee,
fitness professional or employee of a supplier or contractor present on site at peak times and most such
staff are trained in first aid. In addition, where gyms are unstaffed, such gyms have continuously
recording closed-circuit television security cameras, which are monitored during non-peak hours, for
the monitoring and reporting of accidents and other emergencies. Furthermore, those gyms with CCTV
have help points where members can speak live to the individuals who are monitoring the CCTV feeds.
Automated defibrillators are installed in all gyms and our employees undergo a continuous and
extensive training program in health and safety policies, which is conducted through e-learning
modules. We consistently monitor our health and safety policies and implements changes as needed on
an ongoing basis.

144

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2023, we employed 6,902 people, including 613 people in management and
administrative roles and 6,289 in gym operational roles. Our organizational and technology structures
are specifically designed to optimize the number of employed staff at each gym location. A large
number of gym functions, including most maintenance and cleaning, are outsourced to third parties.
See “—Suppliers.”

We believe that attracting, motivating and retaining high caliber employees with the desire, ability and
passion to operate within our values and culture is key to our continued success. We provide
management training programs designed to enable quality talent to develop confidently through the
gym operations hierarchy, feeding the resource need generated by high growth. In central functions, we
attract and retain quality individuals into broad, agile roles, enabling personal and professional
development through interesting work in a continually evolving high growth environment.

We believe that we have good relationships with our employees and continually strive to improve the
work environment and experience for our people. This is evidenced by the fact that none of our gyms
have suffered a material work stoppage or strike.

Our business unit in Denmark has a proportion of employees contracted under a collective bargaining
agreement. The relationship with the Union is positive and there is no material risk of strike action.

During the pandemic, we furloughed our workforce in all geographies where possible. In the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 we received £103.0 million in total governmental furlough
and business rate relief support.

**Government Regulation and Industry Standards**

**_The EUGDPR, the Danish Data Protection Act, the UKGDPR and the UK Data Protection Act_**

EUGDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018 and is supplemented under Danish law by the DDPA,
which replaced the former Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data. UKGDPR, which generally
mirrors the EUGDPR, came into effect on January 31, 2020, as a direct consequence of the UK leaving
the EU, and it is supplemented under UK law by the UKDPA, which replaced the former UK Data
Protection Act 1998. The EUGDPR, DDPA, UKGDPR and UKDPA altogether set out more onerous
and stringent requirements for controllers and processors’ processing of personal data, including
expanded disclosure requirements. For example, when collecting personal data, certain information
must be provided to the individual whose data is being collected. This information includes the identity
of the data controller, the purpose for which the data is being collected and other relevant information
relating to the processing. In some cases, the consent of those data subjects may also be required to
process the personal data for the purposes notified to them. Personal data may only be used for the

We have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the EUGDPR, the DDPA,

**_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard_**

The UK PCI DSS is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder
information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM, and point-of-sale cards. The PCI DSS
helps to reduce the risk of theft of customers’ card data through controls concerning the storage,
transmission and processing of cardholder data that businesses handle. It also includes standards that
promote the detection of fraud and appropriate reactions to security incidents.

All entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data must be PCI DSS compliant. It is not,
however, mandatory for all entities to obtain formal validation of PCI DSS compliance. Formal
validation requirements depend on the payment brand to which the merchant has subscribed or is in
agreement.

An organization’s compliance with the PCI DSS is validated annually, either by an external Qualified
Security Assessor who creates a Report on Compliance for organizations that handle a large volume of
transactions, or by a Self-Assessment Questionnaire for companies that handle a smaller volume of
transactions.

We make use of a third-party payment services provider and do not store cardholder information on its
own systems; therefore, we complete the self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ A) on an annual basis.

We comply with PCI DSS in Denmark, as we make use of a third-party payment services provider who
stores certain member cardholder information. However, we do also store member payment details for
direct debit collection purposes in our membership database hosted by Exerp.

We also make use of third-party payment service providers in Switzerland and the United States, and
do not store cardholder information on our respective systems in those geographies. Even though we
do not store cardholder information in our respective systems in Switzerland, as our Swiss business is
a Swiss operators it is required to comply with PCI DSS.

**Legal Proceedings**

We have been, and may from time to time be, party to various claims and legal proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of its business, such as contract claims, employee claims and intellectual property
disputes, among others. We have not been within the last 12 months, and are not currently a party to
any governmental, legal, administrative, arbitration or dispute proceedings, either individually or in the
aggregate, that has had, or is expected to have, a material adverse effect on its financial position and
results of operations. As a result of COVID-19, we may be subject to increased risk of litigation
following the end of the rent moratorium in the UK. For additional detail, see “Risk Factors—Risks
_relating to our business—We may face increased risk of litigation following the period in which the UK_
_rent moratorium is lifted.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain indebtedness
of the Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors, when payments can be
made in respect of debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that

Senior Secured Financing Creditors (as defined below).

      - The “Super Senior Creditors” include the RCF Lenders together with the Priority
Hedge Counterparties (as defined below).

in respect of liabilities to the RCF Lenders, liabilities to the holders of the Notes, the Permitted

liabilities owed to such creditors being the “Permitted Senior Secured Financing
**Liabilities”); and**

(d) creditors of any Senior Notes (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and

other future indebtedness of the Holdco (the “Permitted Senior Financing Creditors”), which

Business Days) due by such Debtors to any such member of the Group exceeds £2,500,000. The
Intercreditor Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to any such Intra-Group Liabilities.

Agreement or the Indenture or any Senior Notes Indenture is continuing; and (iii) the Intercreditor
Agreement contains subordination provisions relating to loans or indebtedness owed by a member of
the Group to Holdco (Holdco in its capacity as creditor of such liabilities being the “Holdco Lender”

any Permitted Senior Financing Debt by the Holdco Lender (the “Holdco (Proceeds Loan)
**Liabilities”)).**

**Event of Default”) is continuing and any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative**
has received a Senior Payment Stop Notice from either the RCF Facility Agent or the Trustee
or other relevant representative of the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt (each, a
“Senior Secured Agent”), from the date the relevant Permitted Senior Financing
Representative, the Security Agent and Holdco receive the Senior Payment Stop Notice, all
payments in respect of Senior Liabilities (other than those for which Required Senior Consent
has been obtained) are suspended until the earliest of:

(i) 179 days after the receipt by the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative of
the Senior Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) if a Senior Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of
that Senior Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Standstill Period expires;

(iii) the date on which there is a waiver or remedy of the relevant Senior Secured Event of
Default;

156


-----

(iv) the date on which the Senior Secured Agent which delivered the Senior Payment Stop
Notice notifies (among others) the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative,
the Security Agent and Holdco that the Senior Payment Stop Notice is cancelled;

(v) the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or Senior Secured Agent takes any enforcement
action (including acceleration and/or demand for payment and certain similar actions)
(“Enforcement Action”) against a Debtor which it is permitted to take in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement,

_provided_ that none of the circumstances described above shall prevent the Senior Debt Issuer from
making or the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors from receiving payments in respect of the Permitted
Senior Financing Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the relevant Permitted Senior Debt
Documents as a borrower and/or an issuer but only to the extent that the payment is not funded from
the proceeds of a payment received from a member of the Group which is otherwise prohibited by the
above or the relevant provisions in respect of Holdco Liabilities.

No new Senior Payment Stop Notice may be served by a Senior Secured Agent unless 360 days

have elapsed since the immediately prior Senior Payment Stop Notice. No Senior Payment Stop Notice
may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Event of Default more than 60 days after the date that the
Senior Secured Agent received notice of that Senior Secured Event of Default. No Senior Secured Agent
may serve more than one Senior Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances, and no Senior Payment Stop Notice may be served in respect of a Senior Secured Event
of Default notified to a Senior Secured Agent at the time at which an earlier Senior Payment Stop Notice
was issued.

If a Senior Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding or the relevant Senior Secured Event

of Default or Senior Secured Payment Default has ceased to be continuing (by being waived by the
relevant creditors/creditor’s representative or remedied) the relevant Debtor may then make those
payments it would have otherwise been entitled to pay under the Permitted Senior Financing Debt and
if it does so promptly any Senior Event of Default (as defined below) (and any cross-default or similar
provision under any other debt document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be waived and any notice which may have been issued as a result of that Senior Event
of Default (as defined below) shall be waived. A Senior Secured Payment Default is remedied by the
payment of all amounts then due.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement by the Permitted Senior Financing Debt; Senior Standstill Period_**

Without prejudice to the rights of the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors to take Enforcement Action
in relation to the Permitted Senior Financing Issuer Liabilities, prior to the Senior Secured Debt
Discharge Date, no Permitted Senior Financing Creditor shall:

(i) direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any
Transaction Security; or

(ii) take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Guarantee
Liabilities,

(iii) without the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (as defined below),
except that such restriction will not apply if:

(iv) an event of default under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Liabilities (a
“Senior Event of Default”) is continuing;

157


-----

(v) each Senior Secured Agent has received notice of the relevant Senior Event of Default
from the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Representative;

(vi) a Senior Standstill Period (as defined below) has expired; and

(vii) the relevant Senior Event of Default is continuing at the end of the Senior Standstill
Period.

A “Senior Standstill Period” shall mean the period starting on the date that the relevant

Permitted Senior Financing Representative serves an enforcement notice on each of the Senior Secured
Agents until the earliest of:

(i) 179 days after such date;

(ii) the date on which the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation
to a particular guarantor of the Senior Liabilities (a “Senior Guarantor”), provided
that the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors may only take the same Enforcement
Action against such Senior Guarantor as is taken by the Senior Secured Parties;

(iii) the date on which an insolvency event occurs in respect of any Senior Guarantor, in
which case Enforcement Action is to be taken only against such Senior Guarantor;

(iv) the date of the consent of the relevant Senior Secured Agents (acting on behalf of the
relevant creditors); and

(v) the expiration of any other Senior Standstill Period which was outstanding at the date
that the current Senior Standstill Period commenced (other than as a result of a cure,
waiver or permitted remedy thereof).

**_Consultation_**

Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received Conflicting
Enforcement Instructions (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), it shall promptly notify each
Hedge Counterparty (as applicable) and the agents for each of the Super Senior Creditors and/or the
Senior Secured Agents (each, an “Agent”) and each such Agent will consult with each other and the
Security Agent in good faith for 30 days (or as may be agreed) from the earlier of (i) the date of the
latest such Conflicting Enforcement Instruction and (ii) the date falling ten Business Days after the date
the original Enforcement Proposal (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) is delivered
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required where the Agents are in agreement with regard to any proposed
Enforcement Action, or if:

(i) any of the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency
event; or

(ii) creditors holding more than 66.67% of the participations in the Super Senior Credit
Liabilities (the “Acceleration Majority Super Senior Creditors”) or the creditors
holding more than 50.1% of the participations in the Senior Secured Liabilities (the
“Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) determine in good faith (and
notify each other representative agent of the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured
Creditors and the Permitted Senior Secured Financing Creditors, as applicable) that any
delay caused by such consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security
or the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security.

158


-----

Following the Consultation Period (or if the Consultation Period was terminated or not required as
provided for above), there shall be no further obligation to consult and the Security Agent may act in
accordance with the instructions as to enforcement (an “Enforcement”) then or previously received
from the Instructing Group (as defined below) and the Instructing Group may issue instructions as to
Enforcement to the Security Agent at any time thereafter.

If the Acceleration Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured
Creditors (acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in
a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined below), subject
to the above, the relevant Senior Secured Agent shall give notice to the other representatives after which
each such representative shall consult with the Security Agent for a period of 30 days (or such lesser
period as the Senior Secured Agents may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of Enforcement,
_provided that such representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each_
Enforcement.

For the purposes of Enforcement, an “Instructing Group” means,

(i) if prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), the Acceleration Majority Super Senior Creditors and the
Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors (in each case acting through its
respective Agent), provided that if:

(A) the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities have not been repaid in full in cash within
six months of the date of the first instructions of Enforcement given to the
Security Agent (or withing three months of the first instructions of Enforcement
given to the Security Agent following any failure to pay on the maturity date
of the Credit Facility (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement));
or

(B) the Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in
lieu thereof) or other Enforcement Action within three months of the date of
the first instructions of Enforcement given to the Security Agent,

then the Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are given (at the same time or
subsequently) by the Acceleration Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same
comply with the Security Enforcement Principles (“Qualifying Instructions”) to the exclusion of those
given by the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent conflicting with any
instructions previously given by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and “Instructing Group” in
relation to such Enforcement shall mean the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

Subject to the foregoing, if at the end of the Consultation Period, the Security Agent has received
Conflicting Enforcement Instructions then, in relation to such Enforcement, “Instructing Group” shall
mean the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors, _provided_ that such instructions from the
Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors are Qualifying Instructions, it being acknowledged that,
subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for the realization of value
from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed Disposal (as defined below) pursuant
to such instructions will be determined by the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

(i) after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date (as that term is defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), creditors holding more than 50.1% of the participations in
the aggregate of the total Senior Secured Credit Liabilities and all Super Senior Credit
Liabilities of all Priority Hedge Counterparties, in each case, at that time; and

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date but before the Permitted Senior
Financing Discharge Date (as each such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement),

159


-----

subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Majority Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that Enforcement instructions must be consistent with the
following principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(i) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction
Security to maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization
of value from Enforcement of the Transaction Security, recovery by the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”).

(ii) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be
taken such that either (i) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Security Agent
in cash for distribution in accordance with the Payments Waterfall (as defined below);
or (ii) if Enforcement is at the direction of the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, sufficient proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent
in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the Payments
Waterfall, the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full (unless
the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(iii) The Enforcement Action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that,
subject to the other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the
realization of value from the Enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed
Disposal will be determined by the Instructing Group, provided that it is consistent with
the Security Enforcement Objective.

(iv) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other than
shares in a member of the Holdco Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets
exceeds £5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any of the
Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a member of the Holdco Group
over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from
the Instructing Group (unless it is incompatible with enforcement proceedings in a
relevant jurisdiction) appoint an accounting firm of international standing and
reputation, any reputable and independent international investment bank or other
reputable and independent professional services firm with experience in restructuring
and enforcement, in each case as selected by the Security Agent acting reasonably and
in good faith (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the proceeds received
from any such Enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into
account all relevant circumstances (the “Financial Advisor’s Opinion”).

(v) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to
seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(vi) The Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action
is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances)
will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met.

(vii) Where the Instructing Group is the Acceleration Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s
Opinion where sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security
Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the

160


-----

Payments Waterfall below, the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities are repaid and
discharged in full.

(viii) In the event that an Enforcement of the Transaction Security is over assets and shares
referred to in (d) above and such Enforcement is conducted by way of public auction,
the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to
participate in such auction on the basis of equal information and access rights as other
bidders and financiers in the auction. There is no requirement in the Security
Enforcement Principles summarized in this paragraph (h) that requires the Enforcement
of Transaction Security to take place by way of public auction.

(ix) In the absence of written notice from a Secured Party or group of Secured Parties that
are not part of the relevant Instructing Group that such Secured Party/ies object to any
Enforcement of the Transaction Security on the grounds that such Enforcement Action
does not aim to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective (an “Objection”), the
Security Agent is entitled to assume that such Enforcement of the Transaction Security
is in accordance with the Security Enforcement Objective.

(x) If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the
Security Agent to rely on other advisors and/or exercise its own judgment in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent
opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to any other Enforcement of the
Transaction Security that such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking
into account all relevant circumstances) to the effect that the particular action could
reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective will be
conclusive evidence that the requirement of paragraph (a) above has been met.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, _provided that no_
additional obligations may be imposed on a member of the Holdco Group without the consent of the
Issuer.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions set out therein, the Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if any Senior
Secured Creditors, Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or Super Senior Creditors (each, a “Primary
**Creditor”) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of all or part of the Transaction**
Security or any Distressed Disposal other than in accordance with the Payments Waterfall, then it shall:

      - in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold
an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities on trust for the
Security Agent and separate from other assets, property or funds and promptly pay that
amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any)
by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

      - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly
pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Certain further turnover obligations following receipt of non-permitted payments apply to Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors and Subordinated Creditors.

**_Application of Proceeds/Waterfall_**

161


-----

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with

the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (other than the Shared
Security) and all amounts required to be turned over pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (the
“Enforcement Proceeds”) shall be applied by the Security Agent at any time as the Security Agent (in
its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in the following order of priority (the
“Payments Waterfall”):

      - first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its
delegates, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

      - second, in discharging (i) any Agent Liabilities, (ii) any Arranger Liabilities and (iii)
any Trustee Liabilities, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

      - third, in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Super Senior
Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors in connection with any realization or
enforcement of the Transaction Security (other than Shared Security) taken in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the
request of the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement;

      - fourth, in payment to the Super Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge
of the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

      - fifth, in payment to the Senior Secured Creditors for application towards the discharge
of the Liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors on a pro rata basis and pari
passu;

      - sixth, after the Final Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), in
payment of the balance, if any, to the relevant Debtor or any other person entitled to it.

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Shared Security and all amounts required to be turned
over pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied by the Security Agent at any time as the
Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in the following
order of priority:

      - _first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any of its_
delegates, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

      - _second, in discharging (i) any Agent Liabilities or (ii) Arranger Liabilities and (iii) any_
Trustee Liabilities, on a pro rata and pari passu basis;

      - _third, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any Super Senior Creditor or_
Senior Secured Creditor in connection with any realization or enforcement of the
Shared Security taken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any action
taken at the request of the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement;

      - _fourth, in payment to the Super Senior Creditors for application towards the discharge_
of the Super Senior Creditor Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu;

      - _fifth, in payment to the Senior Secured Creditors for application towards the discharge_
of the Liabilities owed to the Senior Secured Creditors on a _pro rata basis and pari_
_passu;_

162


-----

      - _sixth, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any Permitted Senior Financing_
Creditor in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Shared Security taken
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any action taken at the request of the
Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement;

      - _seventh, in payment to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors for application_
towards the discharge of the Senior Liabilities on a pro rata basis and pari passu; and

      - _eighth, following the Final Discharge Date, the balance, if any, in payment to the_
relevant Debtor to the relevant Debtor or any other person entitled to it.

**Release and/or Transfer of Claims and Liabilities in Respect of the Permitted Senior Financing**
**Debt, the Notes and the Transaction Security**

**_Non-distressed Disposal_**

The Security Agent will (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly

release from the Transaction Security and the relevant documents:

(a) any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a relevant finance

document (a “Secured Debt Document”)) over any asset which is the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document;

or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt

Document pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of
the Holdco Group;

(b) any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt

Document) over any document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the
Holdco Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document or agreement or
otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to that
document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any Secured
Debt Document);

(c) any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt

Document) over any asset of any member of the Holdco Group which has ceased to be a Debtor
in accordance with the terms of the Secured Debt Documents; and

(d) any Transaction Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Secured Debt

Document) over any other asset to the extent that such release is in accordance with the terms
of the Secured Debt Documents.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of
any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor)
will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor, in each case, provided that such disposal or other
transaction is not prohibited under a Secured Debt Document, the Security Agent will (at the request
and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release that Debtor and its Subsidiaries from all
present and future liabilities (both actual and contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents and the
respective assets of such Debtor and its Subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or
Subsidiary) from the Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claims
relating to a Secured Debt Document and any guarantee or other liabilities).

When making any request for a release pursuant to the above the Parent will confirm in writing to the
Security Agent that: (i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above, the

163


-----

relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Document; and (ii)
the release requested (or relevant action needing the release) is in accordance with (or is not prohibited
by) the terms of, any Secured Debt Document and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that
confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent will (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor but without the need for any
further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) promptly enter
into and deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) will
require to give effect to any release or other matter contemplated by this section.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in
accordance with the terms of any of the Secured Debt Documents, the Security Agent and the other
Secured Party will (at the cost of the relevant Debtor and/or the Parent) promptly execute any guarantee,
security or other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the
Transaction Security documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Secured Debt Documents
(and the Security Agent is authorized by the Secured Parties to execute, and will promptly execute if
requested by the Parent, without the need for any further any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Secured Party, any such release or document on behalf of the Secured Parties).
When making any request pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent will confirm in writing to the Security
Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Secured Debt Document and the Security
Agent will be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

In the case of any release of Transaction Security requested by the Parent pursuant to the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement as part of a Permitted Transaction (as that term is defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (a “Permitted Transaction Request”), when making that
request the Parent will confirm to the Security Agent that:

      - such request is a Permitted Transaction Request (and absent any such statement in a
request for a release the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume for all purposes that
such request is not a Permitted Transaction Request); and

      - it has determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and
other relevant considerations in relation to that Permitted Transaction) that it is either
not possible or not desirable to implement that Permitted Transaction on terms
satisfactory to the Parent by granting additional Transaction Security and/or amending
the terms of the existing Transaction Security in lieu of the requested release,

and the Security Agent will be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured
Debt Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Permitted Senior Debt
Documents, if any member of the Holdco Group is required to apply, or not prohibited under the
Permitted Senior Debt Documents from applying, the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in
prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Secured Liabilities:

      - no such application of those proceeds will require the consent of any party or Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor or will result in a direct or indirect breach of any Permitted
Senior Debt Document; and

      - any such application will discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in
prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities.

The above paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Holdco Group to apply any
proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or

164


-----

reduction of any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the
Intercreditor Agreement or not prohibited by any other Secured Debt Document.

Nothing in any Transaction Security shall operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction,
matter or other step not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Secured Debt
Document (a “Permitted Transaction”). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured
Parties) agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any party to the Intercreditor Agreement) that it shall (at the
request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly execute any release or other document
and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Secured Debt Document (or any asset subject
or expressed to be subject to any Transaction Security) as is requested by the Parent in order to complete,
implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to:

      - release the Transaction Security; and

      - release each investor (an “Investor”), Debtor and other member of the Group from all
liabilities, undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of Holdco), subject, in
respect of the second bullet point above, to certain agency or trustee protective provisions in any of the
Secured Debt Documents, which will survive the termination of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Distressed Disposal_**

A “Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset of a member of the Holdco Group subject to the
Transaction Security which is:

(a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where

the Transaction Security has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Transaction Security documents;

(b) being effected by enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with

the terms of the relevant Transaction Security documents; or

(c) being effected, after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, by a Debtor or

Holdco to a person or persons which is not a member of the Holdco Group.

Where a Distressed Disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent is authorized:

(i) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset

and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that Transaction Security, or claim
and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to
dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of an

Debtor, to release on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors and Agents (a) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of: (x) the liabilities it
may have as a principal Debtor in respect of financial indebtedness arising under the
Debt Documents (whether incurred solely or jointly) (the “Borrowing Liabilities”)
(other than Borrowing Liabilities of the Issuer and the Senior Debt Issuer); (y) the
liabilities under the Debt Documents (present or future, actual or contingent and
whether incurred solely or jointly) it may have as or as a result of its being a guarantor

165


-----

or surety or giving an indemnity, contribution or subrogation and in particular any
guarantee or indemnity arising under or in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities
Documents or the Permitted Senior Debt Documents (as each such term is defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) (the “Guarantee Liabilities”) and (z) any trading and
other liabilities (not being Borrowing Liabilities or Guarantee Liabilities) it may have
to any Agent (other than any Hedge Counterparty), Arranger (as such term is defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement), any Intra-Group Lender or any Debtor (the “Other
**Liabilities”); (b) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of**
that Debtor over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of an Investor, an Intra-Group
Lender, Holdco or other Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any

holding company of a Debtor, to release on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors
and Agents (a) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its Borrowing Liabilities (other than Borrowing Liabilities of the
Issuer or the Senior Debt Issuer), Guarantee Liabilities and Other Liabilities; (b) any
Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and (c) any other claim of any Investor, Intra-Group
Lender, Holdco or another Debtor over the assets of that holding company or of any
subsidiary of that holding company;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a

Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to dispose of
all or any part of (y) all present and future moneys, debts, liabilities and obligations
due at any time of any Debtor or any holding company of such Debtor or any subsidiary
of such Debtor or holding company owed to any Creditor under the Debt Documents,
both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly with any other person
or in any other capacity, together with any additional liabilities (the “Liabilities”)
(other than Borrowing Liabilities of the Issuer or the Senior Debt Issuer); or (z) any
liabilities owed by that Debtor to any other Debtor (whether actual or contingent and
whether incurred solely or jointly) (the “Debtor Liabilities”) (A) if the Security Agent
does not intend that any transferee of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities will be
treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part
of those Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities _provided_ that notwithstanding any other
provision of any Debt Document, the transferee shall not be treated as a Primary
Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) if
the Security Agent does intend that any transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor
or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of (I) all (and not part only) of the
Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors; and (II) all or part of any other Liabilities
and the Debtor Liabilities, on behalf of, in each case the relevant creditors and Debtors;
and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a

Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security

to be transferred.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that Shared Security or any guarantees in respect of the
Permitted Senior Financing Debt will be released or Permitted Senior Financing Debt will be disposed
of, it is a condition to the release that either:

(i) each Permitted Senior Financing Representative has approved the

release and/or disposal (as applicable) (acting on the instructions of the required
percentage of Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in respect of which it is the
Permitted Senior Financing Representative under the relevant Permitted Senior Debt
Documents); or

(ii) where shares or assets of a Senior Guarantor or assets of the Senior

Debt Issuer are sold:

              - the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially
in cash); and

Disposal, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and such obligations are
not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
Transaction Security in respect of the assets that are sold or
disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released
concurrently with such sale, provided that if each Senior Secured
Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith):

                  - determines that the Super Senior Creditors and the
Senior Secured Creditors (excluding in each case for
these purposes the Hedge Counterparties) will recover a
greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise
transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and
not released and discharged; and

                  - serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming
the same,

              - the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer
such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount received in connection
therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the

167


-----

method of enforcement and the circumstances giving
rise to such sale or disposal, provided that the liability of
such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of
its fees in respect of such engagement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser
unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

**_Application of Proceeds of a Distressed Disposal_**

The net proceeds of a Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities) will be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set forth
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Application of
_Proceeds/Waterfall” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security.

**_Voting and Amendments_**

that document;

(e) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a Hedging

Agreement, that Hedge Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant
amendment or waiver adversely affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that Hedge
Counterparty and is an amendment or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that
Hedge Counterparty under the applicable Hedging Agreement, as notified by the Parent to the
Security Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver); and

(f) the Parent.

168


-----

does not materially and adversely affect the interests of other creditors, will require only the written
agreement from the affected Secured Parties.

Other than when any such amendments, waivers or consents would adversely affect the nature of the
Charged Property or the manner in which enforcement proceeds are applied, the Security Agent may,
if authorized by an Instructing Group, and if the Parent consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the
requirements of or grant consents under, any of the Transaction Security documents which shall be
binding on each party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

An amendment, waiver or consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an
Agent, an Arranger or the Security Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without
the consent of that Agent, that Arranger or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The terms of the immediately preceding paragraph does not apply to any release of Transaction Security,
claim or Liabilities or to any consent which the Security Agent gives in accordance with certain clauses
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

relation to any Permitted Senior Secured Financing Debt or in relation to any Permitted Senior
Financing Debt (including under any Senior Notes Indenture) (an “Acceleration Event”), by giving 10

Liabilities may require the transfer to them of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in
respect of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities (as each such term is defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), subject to certain conditions (including but not limited to full payment of all Credit Facility
Lender Liabilities, cash cover, and associated costs and expenses, and provision of certain indemnities).

Following an Acceleration Event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security and after a Senior
Secured Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), a simple majority of the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors may, by giving 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the
transfer to them of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Liabilities, provided that certain conditions are met.

**_Hedging_**

**New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On or prior to the Issue Date, the Issuer (as original borrower and original guarantor), Barclays Bank
PLC, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Royal Bank of Canada, ING Bank N.V., London Branch and
J.P. Morgan Securities PLC (as lenders), Barclays Bank PLC (as facility agent) and Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch (as security agent), among others, entered into the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement for the provision of a revolving credit facility up to £175,000,000 (the “Original RCF
**Amount”).**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the in
pounds sterling, euro, U.S. dollars and Danish kroner or certain other currencies (if agreed) by the
drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (upon the appointment of an Issuing Bank) and
by way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid
and re-borrowed at any time. Borrowings are available to be used for general corporate and working
capital purposes of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) including,
without limitation, for payment of interest under the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional
tranches of an existing facility under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Additional
**Facility Commitments”)** _provided that the aggregate principle amount of Total Commitments (as_
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (including the Additional Facility
Commitments) does not exceed the amount permitted to be incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” below. The_
Issuer and the lenders may agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments,
including the margin, the termination date and the availability period (each subject to parameters as set
out in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). There are certain limitations on the ability to
incur Additional Facility Commitments.

**_Availability_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent,
be utilized from (and including) the Issue Date until the date falling one month prior to the maturity
date of the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

170


-----

The Issuer and Pure Gym Denmark A/S are the original borrowers under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and the Guarantor are the original guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility. A
mechanism is included in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable certain of its
subsidiaries to accede as additional borrowers or additional guarantors under the New Revolving Credit
Facility, subject to certain conditions.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires that, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt,
the section entitled “Guarantees” below, in the future each member of the Group (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) which is required to become a guarantor in order to satisfy the
Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined below), becomes an additional guarantor under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (subject to agreed security principles).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date three months prior to the maturity date of the
Notes. Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to a
netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding amounts under the New
Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the New Revolving
Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the New Revolving Credit
Facility may be re-borrowed during its availability period, subject to certain conditions. The termination
date for a facility under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the Issuer and
the relevant lenders.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

The interest rate on loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum equal to the
aggregate of the applicable margin plus SONIA (or in relation to advances in euro, EURIBOR, or in
relation to advances in U.S. dollars, term SOFR, or in relation to advances in Danish kroner, CIBOR)
(as each term is defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, in each case, subject to
a zero floor. The initial margin under the New Revolving Credit Facility is 4.00% per annum. If at least
nine months have expired since the Issue Date, provided that no payment (insofar as it relates to nonpayment of principal and/or interest and/or certain fees), financial covenant or insolvency / creditors
process related event of default has occurred and is continuing, the margin on the loans are reduced if
the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (representing the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Indebtedness on such quarter date to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four
consecutive financial quarters (subject to certain provisions and adjustments), the first such period
ended on the first quarter date that fell at nine months after the Issue Date (each such term as defined in
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) are met.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Original RCF
Amount which accrues from (and including) the Issue Date to (and including) the last day of the
availability period for the New Revolving Credit Facility at the rate of 30% of the then applicable
margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on
the last day of the availability period of the New Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the New
Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender’s commitment is cancelled.

Default interest on overdue amounts are calculated at a rate which is 1% higher than that applicable to
the loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Issuer will pay customary agency fees to the facility agent and the Security Agent in connection
with the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Guarantees_**

171


-----

The Guarantors (and any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries which accede to the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement as additional borrowers or additional guarantors) will provide a senior guarantee of all
amounts payable to the Finance Parties (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

Under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement the Issuer will ensured that subject to agreed
security principles, the guarantee provided by the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement represent no less than 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (as defined in the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (subject to certain exceptions) (the “Guarantor Coverage
**Test”).**

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of the Issuer falling after the Issue Date, the Guarantor
Coverage Test is not satisfied, within 120 days following delivery of the annual financial statements for
the relevant fiscal year, such other restricted subsidiaries of the Issuer (subject to agreed security
principles and certain exceptions) are required to become additional guarantors until the Guarantor
Coverage Test is satisfied (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on such
last day of the relevant fiscal year).

**_Security_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility benefits from substantially the same security as will be provided
for the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to be applied to repay
indebtedness outstanding in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.

Any Material Company or other member of the Group (each as defined in the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) which becomes a guarantor of the New Revolving Credit Facility is required
(subject to agreed security principles) to grant certain security interests in favour of the Security Agent.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations and
warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications,
exceptions and baskets, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i)
status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with other obligations; (iv) power and authority; (v)
validity and admissibility in evidence; (vi) governing law and enforcement; and (vii) accuracy of most
recent financial statements delivered.

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments) that may be amended following the Issue Date to reflect the terms
of the Indenture. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains certain other
affirmative and negative covenants. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which
are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge or other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a financial covenant, a brief description
of which is set out below.

**_Notes Purchase Condition_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement restricts the repayment, prepayment, purchase,
redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement of the principal amount of the Notes or any permitted
refinancing thereof prior to its scheduled maturity date in any manner which involves the payment of
cash consideration by a member of the Group to a person who is not a member of the Group (each as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (a “Notes Payment”). A Notes Payment is
permitted under certain circumstances, including where commitments under the New Revolving Credit

172


-----

Facility are permanently cancelled (and, as applicable, amounts outstanding under the New Revolving
Credit Facility are permanently prepaid) in at least the same proportion as that by which the Notes or
permitted refinancing thereof (as applicable) is repaid, prepaid, purchased, redeemed, defeased,
acquired or otherwise retired (calculated by reference to the total New Revolving Credit Facility
commitments (as of the date the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is entered into) and the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes or permitted refinancing thereof (as applicable) in existence at
the Issue Date or incurred at any time thereafter). If the commitments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility have been reduced to £30 million no further cancellation and repayment under the Notes
Purchase Condition shall be required as a condition to making a Notes Payment.

**_Affirmative Covenants_**

The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain information, including annual
audited and quarterly financial statements, compliance certificates and details of any default (including
the steps, if any, being taken to remedy it); (ii) authorizations, (iii) compliance with laws; (iv) discharge
of taxes; (v) preservation of assets; (vi) maintenance of pari passu ranking of the New Revolving Credit
Facility; (vii) rights of access for the facility agent; (ix) maintenance of intellectual property; (x)
satisfaction of Guarantor Coverage Test; (xi) repayment of certain existing financing arrangements; and
(xii) further assurance provisions.

**_Negative Covenants_**

The negative covenants include restrictions, among others, with respect to: (i) substantially changing
the general nature of the business of the Group (as a whole) (as defined in the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement); (ii) the holding company activities of the Issuer; (iii) deliberately changing centres
of main interest; and (iv) non-compliance with economic sanctions. Otherwise, the negative covenants
in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are substantially the same as the negative covenants
in the Indenture.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

On a Change of Control (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), each lender
under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement shall be entitled for a 30-day period after receiving
notice thereof to require that all amounts payable under the Finance Documents (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) by the obligors to that lender will become due and payable and
the borrowers will on the date falling 30 days after notice from such lender has been served on the Issuer
and the facility agent prepay or procure the prepayment of all utilizations provided by that lender and
the undrawn commitments of that lender will be cancelled and such lender shall have no obligation to
participate in further utilizations requested under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, in each
case save to the extent that any ancillary lender or issuing bank, as between itself and the relevant
member of the Group, agrees to continue to provide an ancillary facility or letter(s) of credit, in which
case, after notification thereof to the facility agent such arrangements shall continue on a bilateral basis
and not as part of, or under, the Finance Documents (each defined term as defined in the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Financial Covenants_**

If, on any quarter date in respect of the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters,
the aggregate amount outstanding of all loan utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility
(excluding any amounts utilized by way of Letters of Credit or Ancillary Facilities (as each such term
is defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) exceeds an amount equal to 40 per cent.
of the total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer is required to confirm
whether or not the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
representing the ratio of Senior Secured Indebtedness on such quarter date to Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters (subject to certain provisions and

173


-----

adjustments) (the first such period being 31 December 2023, each such term as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)) exceeds 8.80:1.00. The covenant is tested quarterly.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure excesses in the Leverage Ratio as described above by applying
any cure amount (being amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted
subordinated debt) as if either (i) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) had been increased by such amount or (ii) Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) had been reduced by such amount. There is no requirement
to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility. No more than five cure
amounts may be taken into account during the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility and no more
than two such cure amounts may be made in any period of four consecutive financial quarters.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as those applicable to the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “Description of the
_Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement_
contains the following events of default:

      - breach of the financial covenant;

      - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

      - breach of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

      - unlawfulness, repudiation and rescission of the finance documents entered into in
connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Disenfranchisement_**

Any holder of the Notes that holds an interest in the New Revolving Credit Facility (other than (i) any
of the original lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) any lender that holds notes debt
on a bona fide trading account and, in the case of both (i) and (ii), that is not acting on behalf of a holder
of the Notes) will be disenfranchised from voting on the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**Subordinated Shareholder Funding**

In connection with the 2017 Acquisition, the Issuer incurred subordinated shareholder indebtedness in
the form of loan notes and an intercompany loan from Pinnacle Midco 2 Limited, each of which are
subordinated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and on September 18, 2020, Pinnacle
Midco 2 Limited granted a subordinated shareholder loan to Pinnacle Bidco plc in connection with the
Equity Injection (collectively, the “Subordinated Shareholder Funding”). As of June 30, 2023, the
total amount of subordinated shareholder indebtedness outstanding was £563.7 million (including
accrued and unpaid interest). Until no earlier than the date that is six months subsequent to the maturity
date of the Notes, the Subordinated Shareholder Funding will not require any cash payments, will not
permit enforcements or accelerations and must remain held by holders of the ordinary share capital of
the Issuer. Subordinated Shareholder Funding constitutes “Subordinated Shareholder Funding”
under the Indenture.

174

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

Pinnacle Bidco plc (the “Issuer”) will issue £805 million (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of
senior secured notes, consisting of €        million in aggregate principal amount of      % senior
secured notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and £       million in aggregate principal amount
of      % senior secured notes due 2028 (the “Sterling Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the
“Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”) among itself, Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security
agent (the “Security Agent”), and the other parties thereto.

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this
description, (1) the term “Issuer” refers only to Pinnacle Bidco plc, and not to any of its Subsidiaries
and (2) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The
Notes will be issued in a private transaction that will not be subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Generally, only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation,
with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

The following description is only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents. This description does not purport to be complete and is subject
to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below.
We urge you to read the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents because
they, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders. You may request copies of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents at our address set forth under the
subheading “Summary.” The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined herein). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of
the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used, along with certain cash
on balance sheet, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes in full (including paying the accrued and unpaid
interest), (ii) pay the applicable redemption premium for the Existing Euro Notes and (iii) pay related
fees and expenses, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

    - will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - will rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer, including, the obligations of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility
and certain Hedging Obligations; provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of the
security interests over the Collateral, counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations and
certain other future super priority indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any, and
creditors under the New Revolving Facility Agreement will be repaid with the proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal in priority to the
Notes;

175


-----

    - will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis as described under “—Guarantees”;

    - will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders
of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee
the Notes;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation
(including obligations to trade creditors) of the Issuer secured by property or assets that do
not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness or obligation;

    - will be secured by (i) a fixed charge over bank accounts, shares and receivables and a
floating charge over substantially all assets of the Guarantors incorporated in England and
Wales and (ii) pledges over shares of other Guarantors incorporated in Denmark and
Switzerland (the “Collateral”), in each case, on a first-priority basis along with obligations
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations
(provided that the proceeds from any recovery from the enforcement of any security
interest will be applied to satisfy the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility,
certain priority Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted under the
Indenture, if any, before being applied to satisfy obligations to holders under the Notes and
the Indenture); and

    - will be senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Issuer.

Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the principal amount of additional Indebtedness that

the Issuer and the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (including the Guarantors) may incur, under certain
circumstances the amount of such additional Indebtedness could be substantial and, in any case, such additional
Indebtedness may be secured on assets other than the Collateral. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

**Guarantees**

On or about the Issue Date, Gym Topco Limited, Gym Midco Limited, Gym Midco 2 Limited, Gym
Bidco Limited, Pure Gym Limited, Pinnacle Europe Holdings Limited, Pure Gym Denmark Holding
A/S, Pure Gym Denmark A/S and PureGym AG (collectively, the “Guarantors” and each a
“Guarantor”), as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will, jointly and severally, irrevocably
and unconditionally, guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the full and punctual payment when due,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest in respect of the Notes,
expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the
Indenture or a supplement thereto. In the future, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed
Security Principles and certain exceptions set forth under the caption _“—Certain Covenants—_
_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” each Restricted Subsidiary of_
the Issuer that guarantees certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, including the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, will
guarantee the Notes, subject to release as provided below or elsewhere in this Description of the Notes.

Each Guarantee of the Notes by a Guarantor:

    - will be a general, secured, senior obligation of such Guarantor, secured as set forth under
_“—Security”;_

    - will rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of
such Guarantor (including such Guarantor’s obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations); _provided that, pursuant to the terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an

176


-----

enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, creditors under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future super priority indebtedness permitted
under the Indenture, if any, will be repaid with the proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral in priority to the Notes;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of
such Guarantor secured by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee of the Notes,
to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or
obligation;

    - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness
of such Guarantor; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders
of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that do not
Guarantee the Notes.

Each Guarantee and any Collateral granted or purported to be granted by a Guarantor incorporated in
Denmark and Switzerland will be subject to substantial limitations relating to financial assistance and
corporate benefit considerations that may severely limit the value of such Guarantee and any such
Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and Guarantees provided may be released
in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor_
_subsidiaries.” In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of_
these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and
their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor.
As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any
claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes. The Indenture will not limit the amount
of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries.

The Guarantors accounted for 99% of the Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30,
2023 and substantially all of the consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2023.

The Issuer is a holding company whose only significant assets will be the Capital Stock of its
Subsidiaries and receivables under intra-group financing arrangements. The Issuer’s operations are
conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer primarily depends on the cash flow of its
Subsidiaries to meet its obligations.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not,
however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may
reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee
worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be declared entirely void or subordinated by
a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor,
and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be
reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—
_The insolvency laws of England and Wales, Denmark and Switzerland may not be as favorable to_
_creditors, including investors in the Notes, as the insolvency laws of the jurisdictions with which you_
_are familiar and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_security interests in the Collateral.”_

177


-----

In addition, there are certain circumstances where the Guarantees may not be granted pursuant to the
Agreed Security Principles. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent_
_or the consent of the Trustee” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving_
_Credit Facility Agreement.”_

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount
equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of
all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

**_Release of Guarantee_**

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and

discharged:

(1) upon any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation,

consolidation or otherwise) of (a) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, after which the applicable
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) all or substantially all of the assets of such
Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) in each case, if such sale, exchange,
issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(2) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such

Guarantor of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee as provided in _“—Certain_
_Covenants— Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(3) upon the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted

Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal

defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in _“—Legal_
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) as a result of a transaction permitted by _“—Certain Covenants—Merger,_

_Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;_

(6) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor

Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

(8) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver;” or

(9) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of

Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that (i) such Guarantor is unconditionally released
and discharged from its liabilities with respect to the New Revolving Credit Facility prior to or
substantially concurrently with such termination and release and (ii) such Guarantor would not
otherwise be required at the time of such release to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
_Subsidiaries”._

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the cost of the Issuer, take all necessary actions reasonably
requested in writing by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the

178


-----

releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent of
or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any guarantee by a Parent Company granted in connection with an
incurrence of Senior Notes may be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged for any
reason subsequent to the date on which such Senior Notes are no longer outstanding.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the terms of the Security Documents
and the Agreed Security Principles, by first-priority security interests over substantially all the assets of
the Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales and shares in certain other Guarantors
incorporated in Denmark and Switzerland, as documented in:

    - a debenture between Pinnacle Bidco plc, certain subsidiaries and the Security Agent (as
defined therein);

    - a share pledge agreement in respect of shares in Pure Gym Denmark A/S between Pure
Gym Denmark Holding A/S and the Security Agent (as defined therein); and

    - a share pledge agreement in respect of shares in PureGym AG between Pinnacle Europe
Holdings Limited and the Security Agent (as defined therein).

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging
Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes and such_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.” No appraisals of the Collateral_
have been made in connection with this issuance of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral
will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may
not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants— Liens,”
certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets
may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
including (but not limited to) if:

    - providing such security or guarantee would be prohibited by general legal and statutory
limitations, such as regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance, equity subordination, fraudulent preference, “interest stripping”, “controlled
foreign corporation”, transfer pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions,
retention of title claims and similar principles; _provided_ that the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavors to assist in demonstrating that adequate
corporate benefit accrues to the Issuer and each relevant Guarantor;

    - providing such security or guarantee would require the consent of any supervisory board,
works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or
person’s consent, unless such consent has been received; _provided_ that reasonable
endeavors (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of any external expenses)
have been used by the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to obtain the relevant consent to the
extent permissible by law and regulation and such consent has no material adverse impact
on commercial relationships with third parties (in each case if the Security Agent, taking
into account the Issuer’s view on any such potential impact, reasonably requests the Issuer
to do so);

179


-----

    - the time and cost of providing such guarantee or security (and the extent of the perfection
and/or registration of such security), including adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, notarization and registration fees) is disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the holders;

    - the assets or companies are subject to third-party arrangements which may prevent those
assets from being charged or assigned or those companies from giving a security or
guarantee (or assets which, if charged or assigned, would give a third party the right to
terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the Group in
respect of those assets or require any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof); _provided that reasonable_
endeavors (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of any external expenses)
to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the Group if the Security
Agent reasonably determines the relevant asset to be material and if, in the view of the
Issuer (acting reasonably), taking such security will have no material adverse impact on
commercial relationships with third parties (or otherwise cause the Group to incur any
material cost); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing but without prejudice to the
requirement to use reasonable endeavors as described, no security shall be required over
(and no consent or waiver request submitted with respect to) assets, of a member of the
relevant target group being acquired, which are required to support indebtedness assumed
in connection with an acquisition to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture to
remain outstanding following a permitted acquisition (“Acquired Indebtedness”), and no
member of the target group acquired pursuant to a permitted acquisition where Acquired
Indebtedness remains outstanding following completion of such permitted acquisition
shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security if prevented by the terms of the
documentation governing such Acquired Indebtedness or if becoming a Guarantor or the
granting of security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation)
under or in relation thereto;

    - providing such security or guarantee would not be within the legal capacity of the Issuer
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties
of those directors or contravene any legal prohibition or regulatory condition or would
result in (or in a material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any director,
officer or employee provided that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall use reasonable
endeavors (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of any external expenses)
to overcome any such obstacle;

    - the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or (prior to an acceleration event) the
perfection of the security granted would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant chargor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise
permitted by the Indenture; and

    - the assets are those of any joint venture, similar arrangement or any minority interest or
any Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned by another Restricted Subsidiary.

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses
generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law, see “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under

180


-----

the New Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (if any),
(c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, and (d) the
creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the New Revolving Credit
Facility and such Hedging Obligations, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and
ratably by first-priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain
super senior priority obligations including (i) obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, and
(ii) certain Hedging Obligations (if any) have been paid in full. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may
be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security_
_Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors have granted, or will grant,
security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or
will be, entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured
parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but
also for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from
time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the
lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf
of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the
Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture have
been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be
released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of
the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders may not
be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in
possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the
property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom
(including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of
Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

181


-----

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility or certain hedge counterparties (if any). The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar
arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral will appoint the Security Agent to act as their respective agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security
Documents. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on
its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and
that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the
Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be

deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the

provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional

Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in

accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter

into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Interests in respect of the Collateral may be released under any one or more of the

following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not

the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”), if such sale or other_
disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Repurchase at Option of Holders— Asset

182


-----

_Sales” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted_
Subsidiary provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital
Stock or accounts receivable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization
Subsidiary) unless (subject to the Agreed Securities Principles) the relevant property and assets remain
subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of

the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal

defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Legal
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in

accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and
Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens or rights with respect to such property and

assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale or transfer of property or assets, which may include
Collateral, in each case pursuant to a Qualified Securitization Facility;

(8) in connection with a Public Offering within a reasonable time to facilitate such Public

Offering; provided that such security interests in the Collateral so released shall be promptly granted in
favor of the Notes in the event that the Public Offering does not complete for any reason;

(9) in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the

release of its Liens granted in favor of the New Revolving Credit Facility, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary that would result in the requirement for the Notes and the Guarantees to be
secured on such property, assets or Capital Stock pursuant to covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” or the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens;” or

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the security interest in the Collateral created by the Security Documents will be released
(a) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may
be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by
the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes
will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars and a transfer agent. The initial transfer agent for
the Notes will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and the initial registrar with respect to the Notes

183


-----

will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
the Notes outstanding from time to time. The paying agent will make payments on the Notes, and the
transfer agent will facilitate the transfer of Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the paying agent, the registrar or the transfer agent without prior notice to the
Holders. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

For so long as Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”) and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the
Exchange of any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and the restrictions set
forth in the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Notice to Investors.” The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection
with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, or other tender offer.
Also, the Issuer will not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Note during the
period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue €       million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes and
£       million in aggregate principal amount of Sterling Notes. The Euro Notes will mature
on       , 2028 and the Sterling Notes will mature on       , 2028. The Euro Notes will be issued
in denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiples of €1,000 in excess of €100,000 and the
Sterling Notes will be issued in denominations of £100,000 and any integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess of £100,000.

Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at the rate of       % per annum and interest on the Sterling
Notes will accrue at the rate of       % per annum. Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on each           and        , commencing        , 2024, to the Holders of
record on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date and, in the case of
Definitive Registered Notes only, the         and        , as applicable, immediately preceding
the related interest payment date. Interest on the Sterling Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on each           and        , commencing        , 2024, to the Holders of record on the
Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date and, in the case of Definitive
Registered Notes only, the         and        , as applicable, immediately preceding the related
interest payment date. Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest
has been paid with respect to such Euro Notes or, if no interest has been paid with respect to such Euro
Notes, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Sterling Notes will accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid with respect to such Sterling Notes or, if no interest has been paid
with respect to such Sterling Notes, from and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Euro Notes and
the Sterling Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months
on the aggregate principal amount outstanding.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not
a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will
not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

184


-----

**Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest**

Principal, interest and premium and any applicable Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depository or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and any applicable Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated
securities (“Definitive _Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or_
more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered
Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by bank transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown
on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “Paying Agent and Registrar
_for the Notes” above._

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—

_Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and_
_Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Euro_
Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to this series of Euro
Notes (the “Additional Euro Notes”) and additional Sterling Notes of the same or different series, which
shall have terms substantially identical to this series of Sterling Notes (“Additional Sterling Notes”, and,
together with the Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”) except in respect of any of the
following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall

bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates
on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis
upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and

the currency in which cash or government securities in connection with such series of Additional Notes
may be payable;

(6) the maturity date, and the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or

periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be
redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) in the case of the Additional Euro Notes, if other than in denominations of €100,000

and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Euro
Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) in the case of the Additional Sterling Notes, if other than in denominations of £100,000

and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in which such Additional
Sterling Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(9) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect

to such applicable series of Additional Notes; and

185


-----

(10) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security

Documents.

In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate may include provisions

pertaining to (a) the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited
to, pursuant to any special mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into
which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the
consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a
“Special Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or a portion of the proceeds of such
Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (45) of the definition of “Permitted
_Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent solely for the benefit of the holders of such Additional_
Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes, including
Notes of the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the
Trustee or such security agent to enter into such arrangements provided that, for so long as the proceeds
of such Additional Notes are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and
shall not be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall
not benefit from any security interest in the Collateral. In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may
include provisions pursuant to which such Additional Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP,
ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the consummation of an
acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional Notes bearing a
temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Notes
bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or common code as any existing Notes issued. Additional Notes may be
designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on
the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other
series, and shall be deemed to form one series with other series (including, if applicable, such Notes)
(it being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to
any other series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to
be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions relating
to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

Each of the Euro Notes and the Sterling Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes. All series of
Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for any applicable series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the
Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include
references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional
Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material
respects to such other series, and shall be deemed to form one series with such other series (it being
understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other
series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be
substantially identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions relating
to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to
purchase Notes as described under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.”

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time acquire Notes by means other than a
redemption, whether by tender offer, in the open market, negotiated transactions, or otherwise.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any series of or all of the Notes

aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, validly tender
and do not validly withdraw such Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, in such offer and the Issuer,
or any third party making such offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes or series of Notes,
as applicable, validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the
Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer,

188


-----

and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
90 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder
in such tender offer or other offer to purchase (which in each case may be less than par and shall exclude
any early tender premium, incentive payment or similar payment), plus, to the extent not included in
the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

**_Optional Redemption and Satisfaction and Discharge_**

If the Issuer elects to redeem any series of the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a
satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests
that the Trustee distribute (or cause to be distributed) to the Holders amounts deposited in trust with the
Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption notice
will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly
after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_General_**

Any notice of redemption made in connection with a related transaction or event (including an Equity
Offering, contribution, Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction) may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be given prior to the completion or the occurrence thereof, and any such redemption or notice
may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited
to, the completion or occurrence of the related transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuer may
redeem any series of the Notes or portions thereof pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions
in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made
pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions will have different Redemption Dates. In addition, if such redemption or purchase
is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice will describe each such
condition, and if applicable, will state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Redemption Date may be
delayed until such time (but not more than 90 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed
or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions are satisfied (or waived
by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions are not satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its
sole discretion) by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date as so delayed, or such notice may
be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuer any or all
of such conditions will not be satisfied. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment
of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer
will notify the exchange of any such redemption and the principal amount of any applicable series of
Notes outstanding following any partial redemption of such Notes. In no event will the Trustee be
responsible for monitoring, or charged with knowledge of, the maximum aggregate amount of Notes
eligible under the Indenture to be redeemed. The applicable series of Notes will remain outstanding
until redeemed, notwithstanding that they have been called for redemption or are subject to a notice of
redemption.

The Trustee or the applicable depository will select the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed in the
manner described under “—Selection and Notice.”

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming less than all of any series of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) will select the Notes of such series to be redeemed on

189


-----

a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable), unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however,
that no Euro Note of €100,000 and no Sterling Note of £100,000, as applicable, in aggregate principal
amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Euro Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 and Sterling
Notes in integral multiples of £1,000, as applicable, will be redeemed, unless otherwise required by law
or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the Paying Agent,
the Trustee nor the registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this
paragraph.

Notices of redemption will set forth the applicable redemption date(s) (which redemption date(s) will
be selected by the Issuer in its discretion, subject to any limitations set forth in the Indenture) and will
be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 but not more than
90 days before the purchase or redemption date to each Holder at such Holder’s registered address or
otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption
notices may be delivered more than 90 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the applicable Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.
If any Note is to be redeemed or purchased in part only, any notice of redemption or purchase that
relates to such Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be
redeemed or purchased.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, upon request the Issuer will issue a new Note
in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the original Note in the name
of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note; provided, new Euro Notes will only be issued in
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess of €100,000 and new Sterling
Notes will only be issued in denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess of
£100,000. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions precedent relating thereto, Notes called
for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase. On and after the
Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue on the applicable series of Notes or portions of them called
for redemption or purchase.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes or a series of Notes, as applicable, in whole, but not in part,

at any time upon giving not less than 10 days’ nor more than 90 days’ notice to the Holders of the Notes
or such series of Notes, as applicable, (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to
100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that,
as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or

rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation;
or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application,

administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including
pursuant to a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Payor (as defined under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the Notes or a series of Notes, as applicable, would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and
such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to such Payor (provided that
no Payor shall be required to take any measures that in such Payor’s good faith determination would
result in the imposition on such Payor of any material legal or regulatory burden). In the case of

190


-----

redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become
effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become
effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notice of
redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such
payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes or a series of Notes, as applicable,
were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that
it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor has been or
will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will
accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as conclusive evidence of
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
incorporated, organized or resident for Tax purposes or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax. Any redemption and notice described above will
be subject to the receipt by any paying agent of sufficient funds from a Payor to pay the full redemption
price payable to Holders on or before the Tax Redemption Date.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect

of the Notes or any Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other similar governmental
charge (including, penalties and interest related thereto) (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made

by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, organized

or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required to be made from any payments made with respect to any Note or Guarantee,
as applicable, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor
will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any
such Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

191


-----

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or

former connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder
or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the jurisdiction by which such Taxes have been imposed
(including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, such jurisdiction) but excluding, in each
case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the

beneficial owner of the Note to provide (to the extent it is legally entitled to do so) certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder
or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, in each case, that is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or
part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of any Note for

payment (where presentation is permitted or required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is
first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment

of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax,

assessment or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the

Code (or any amended or successor version of such sections), any regulations promulgated thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof or any agreements entered into or in connection with the
implementation thereof and any law, regulation or official guidance pursuant to such agreements;

(7) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of any note for

payment by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction
by presenting the relevant note to another paying agent; and

(8) any combination of the above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any person who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent the Tax
resulting in such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed or the beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner
held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. Upon request, the Payor
will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes
so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as
provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to
the Payor and will provide such certified copies to the paying agent or registrar or directly to the
Holders. Such copies shall be made available by the paying agent or registrar to the Holders upon
request.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect
to any payment made on any Note or Guarantee, then, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee, copied to the paying agent, an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact

192


-----

that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information
necessary to enable the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on
such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

    - the payment of principal;

    - purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of Notes;

    - interest; or

    - any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof.

The Payor will pay (and indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, court or documentary
taxes, or any other property or similar taxes, charges or levies (including any interest and penalties
related thereto) that arise in and are levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on the execution,
delivery, issuance, or registration of the Notes or any Guarantee or any other document or instrument
in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the initial
purchasers), excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such taxes, charges or levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will
survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to
any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or Guarantees
is made, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer or another Person has
previously or concurrently electronically delivered or mailed a redemption notice with respect to all the
outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” the
Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change
_of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate_
principal amount thereof _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date prior to such repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change
of Control, the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder with the following information:

(1) a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of

Control” and all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for
payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later

than 90 days from the date such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered (the “Change of Control
_Payment Date”), subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered_

193


-----

prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of
Control is delayed;

(3) any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes

accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that

a Holder must follow in order to have the Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that

the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or a portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the

Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with an agent appointed for such purpose an amount equal to the aggregate

Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee

stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer
in the Change of Control Offer.

Change of control events with respect to the Issuer will constitute a mandatory prepayment event under
the New Revolving Credit Facility and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer
(or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide that certain change of control events with respect
to the Issuer constitute a default thereunder. If we experience a change of control that triggers a
mandatory prepayment event or default under our agreements, we could seek a waiver of such
mandatory prepayment event or default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. However, in the event
we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance such Indebtedness, amounts outstanding under such
Indebtedness could be declared due and payable.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain, and future credit agreements or other agreements
relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may contain,
restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time
when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to
the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited
from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would
constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, likely constitute a default
under such other agreements.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited
by our then-existing financial resources, and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_

194


-----

_the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture and the change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford_
_you protection in the event of certain important corporate events and change of control events.”_

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not
be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. The Issuer
will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if, pro forma for
such transaction, the Issuer’s Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio remains below a certain threshold.

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and conditional upon such
Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making
of the Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right,
upon notice given not more than 90 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but excluding, the date of redemption (subject to the right of
the Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that
is on or prior to the redemption date). A Change of Control Offer may be made at the same time as
consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes
and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such
consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise, established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified (at any time, including after a
Change of Control) with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration

(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, in connection with such Asset Sale) at least equal to the fair market value

195


-----

(measured at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise
disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75.0% of the consideration for

such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date on a cumulative basis, received
by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents;
_provided, each of the following will be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents for purposes of this_
clause (2):

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or a Restricted Subsidiary’s most

recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date
of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or a
Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence
or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good
faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by
their terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantor’s Guarantee of the
Notes, that (i) are assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection
with such transfer, so long as neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary remains obligated
therewith) or (ii) are otherwise canceled or terminated in connection with the transaction with
such transferee (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary);

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or a Restricted

Subsidiary from such transferee or in connection with such Asset Sale that are converted by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Sale;

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or a Restricted

Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) £40.0 million and (ii) 30% of Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended Test Period, with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received, or, at
the Issuer’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale, without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value;

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that ceases to be a Restricted

Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale (other than intercompany debt owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary), to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any guarantee of payment of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Sale; and

(e) any Investment, Capital Stock, assets, property or capital or other expenditure

of the kind referred to in clause (2) of the next paragraph.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale (as may be extended

pursuant to paragraph (2) below, the “Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period”), the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount up to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to repay, prepay, purchase or redeem:

(a) Obligations in respect of a Credit Facility (including the New Revolving Credit

Facility) incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred_
_Stock”;_

(b) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(a), Obligations in respect of any

series of Notes at a purchase price no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, and/or

196


-----

any other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral which is pari passu with the
Notes and with respect to such other Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100%, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and any amount not to exceed the applicable prepayment or redemption
premium or any Additional Amounts in respect thereof; or

(c) Obligations in respect of Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a

Guarantor or any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by
Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral,

in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that the Issuer or Restricted_
Subsidiary shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than the Notes)
pursuant to sub-clause (b) that is Public Indebtedness only if the Issuer on a pro rata basis at its
option (i) redeems Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”, (ii) purchases Notes
through open market purchases, at a price no less than 100% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, or (iii) makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to
purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer
for an aggregate principal amount of Notes, in each case, equal to the proportion that (x) the
total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate
principal amount of the Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding
of such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

_provided, further, in the case of an offer pursuant to the preceding proviso, (i) if an offer to purchase_
any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is made, such amount will be deemed repaid
to the extent of the amount of such offer, whether or not accepted by the holders of such Indebtedness,
and no Net Proceeds in the amount of such offer will be deemed to exist following such offer, and (ii)
if the holder of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer declines the repayment of such
Indebtedness owed to it from such Net Proceeds, such amount will be deemed repaid to the extent of
the declined Net Proceeds; or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, (b) capital expenditures, (c)

other expenditures made in connection with the construction or development of facilities operated or to
be operated by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, (d) acquisitions of properties (including fee and
leasehold interests) or (e) acquisitions of other assets, in the case of clauses (a), (d) and this clause (e),
either (i) are or will be used or useful in a Similar Business or (ii) that replace, in whole or in part, the
properties or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; provided, in the case of this clause (2), a
binding commitment will be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such
commitment so long as the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good
faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of
such commitment (or, if later, 365 days after the receipt of such Net Proceeds) (an “Acceptable
_Commitment”) and, in the event that any Acceptable Commitment is later canceled or terminated for_
any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of
such cancellation or termination (or, if later, 365 days after the receipt of such Net Proceeds); provided,
_further, that if any Second Commitment is later canceled or terminated for any reason before such Net_
Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds will constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below); or

(3) any combination of the foregoing.

The amount of Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not invested or applied as provided and within
the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net
Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1)(b) above, will be deemed
to have been so applied whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i) £40.0 million and_
(ii) 30% of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended Test Period, the Issuer
will make an offer to all Holders and, at the option of the Issuer, to any holders of any Indebtedness that

197


-----

is _pari passu_ with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness” and such offer, an “Asset Sale Offer”), to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that
is in an amount equal to at least €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000, in
the case of the Euro Notes, or at least £100,000, or an integral multiple of £1,000 in excess of £100,000,
in the case of the Sterling Notes, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in
the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted
value thereof, if less), _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or, in respect of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, such other price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness), to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to
Excess Proceeds within thirty days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the greater of (i) £40.0
million and (ii) 30% of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended Test
Period by mailing or electronically delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
with a copy to the Trustee, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to any Net Proceeds from an
Asset Sale by making an offer to purchase Notes with respect to all or part of the available Net Proceeds
(the “Advance Portion”) prior to the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period with
respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds in advance of being required to do so by the
Indenture (the “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or
in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess
Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) in any manner not prohibited by
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of Notes and/or the
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of

Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Trustee will select the
Notes to be repaid or purchased in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice,” and the Issuer
will select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased pursuant to the terms of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness; _provided, as between the Notes and any Pari Passu Indebtedness, such repayments or_
purchases will be made on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes
or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu
Indebtedness will be repaid or repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion
of any such Asset Sale Offer, for purposes of this provision the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the Asset Sale Offer will be reset to
zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such
completion). An Asset Sale Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect
to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale
Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net
Proceeds may invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

198


-----

The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain, and future credit agreements or other similar
agreements to which the Issuer (or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries) becomes a party may contain
restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when
the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the
repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the
Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute
an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such
other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Changes in Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

During any period of time that (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating and (ii) no Default

has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the
date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
not be subject to the covenants described under the following captions (collectively, the “Suspended
_Covenants”):_

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and

_Preferred Stock”;_

(4) clause (1)(d) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation, Consolidation or Sale

_of All or Substantially All Assets”;_

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During a Suspension Period (as defined below), the Issuer may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the second sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the
Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period
of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no
longer have an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter
again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this section as
the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension
Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess
Proceeds from Net Proceeds will be reset to zero for purposes of the provision described above under
“—Asset Sales.”

In the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuer or

any Restricted Subsidiary or events occurring prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; provided,

199


-----

(1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after the Reversion Date, the amount of

Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described below under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period;_

(2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the

Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock”;_

(3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an

agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause
(6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a

Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period will be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a)
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer will be required to comply with the covenant described

under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after the Reversion
Date with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and

(6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been

outstanding on the Issue Date, so that they are classified as Permitted Investments permitted under
clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes
or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries will bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the
Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during
a Suspension Period, in each case, as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants
during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time, based
on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period) and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event
of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations
arising during any Suspension Period (that were permitted to be entered into at such time) and to
consummate any transactions contemplated thereby.

During the Suspension Period, the Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged and the obligation to grant further Guarantees will be suspended. Upon the Reversion Date,
the obligation to grant Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will_
be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”).

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the

Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Equity Interests (in each case, solely in such Person’s capacity

200


-----

as holder of such Equity Interest) including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any
merger, amalgamation or consolidation, other than:

(a) dividends, payments or distributions payable solely in Equity Interests (other

than Disqualified Stock) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding of the Issuer or a Parent
Company or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity Interests; or

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and,

in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders
of its Capital Stock other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro
rata basis, measured by value);

(2) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests

of the Issuer or any Parent Company, including in connection with any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation, in each case held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire

or retire for value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or final
maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7), (8) and (9) of the second paragraph

of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or_

(b) the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement for

value of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date
of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement; or

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase,

repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder
Funding (other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder
Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment;

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (5) above being collectively referred
to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of

Default will have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof, and, in the case
of a Restricted Investment utilizing clause 3(h) of this paragraph, no Event of Default described in
clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” will have occurred
and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;

(2) immediately after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment made pursuant to clause

(3)(a) below on a pro forma basis, the Issuer could incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock”; and_

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted

Payments (including the fair market value of any non-cash amount) made by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding
paragraph other than clauses (1) thereof), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

201


-----

(a) 50.0% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as

one accounting period) beginning on January 1, 2022 to the end of the most recently ended Test
Period preceding such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for
such period is a deficit, minus 100.0% of such deficit (which amount in this clause (a) will be
deemed to be not less than zero for such period); plus

(b) 100.0% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value of

marketable securities or other property received by the Issuer since January 1, 2022 (other than
net cash proceeds to the extent such net cash proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or
issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph
of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock”) from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or_
Designated Preferred Stock) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding subsequent to January 1,
2022 or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) of the Issuer subsequent to January 1, 2022 (other than
(v) Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock in each case sold to a Subsidiary of the
Issuer, (w) net cash proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an
issuance or sale of such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock
ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit
of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (x) net cash
proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment
has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clause (4) of the second succeeding paragraph
or (y) Excluded Contributions); plus

(c) 100.0% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value of

marketable securities or other property contributed to the capital of the Issuer following January

Investment would be permitted at such time, pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” and

been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the
application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such Test Period; and

(2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Senior Secured

Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer for the Issuer’s most recently ended Test Period preceding the date

issued would have been no greater than 5.3 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
_forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred,_
or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of
proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such Test Period;

_provided,_ _further, Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors may not incur_
Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under this paragraph if, after giving _pro_
_forma effect to such incurrence (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the_
aggregate amount of Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph then outstanding
would exceed the greater of (1) £40.0 million and (2) 30% of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer
for the most recently ended Test Period on the date of such incurrence or issuance.

the most recently ended Test Period; provided that any Indebtedness incurred under this clause (1) may

above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole
discretion, may divide and classify and may subsequently re-divide and reclassify such item of

to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or a portion
thereof) in such of the above clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant as determined by the

(4) in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any

leverage ratio, will be calculated with respect to such incurrence under the first paragraph of this

(5) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that

are otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness that will not be
included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; _provided_ that the incurrence of the
Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was incurred in
compliance with this covenant; and

(6) for the purposes of determining “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA”, Run-Rate Adjusted

EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on the date on which a new commitment is
obtained or the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred or otherwise in compliance with the
covenant described under the caption “—Financial Calculations.”.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies, or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to change in IFRS will, in each case, not be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of
this covenant. Any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to refinance or replace
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to clauses (2), (3), (4), (12),
(13),(14), (23), (28) and (29) above will be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest and dividends and premiums,
defeasance costs and fees and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement.
For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under
a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions or
any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid
daily (or otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for
purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and
not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.K. pound sterling-denominated restriction on the
incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.K. pound
sterling-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
denominated in a foreign currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was incurred, in the case of
term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.K. pound sterling
equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; _provided_ if such Indebtedness is incurred or
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as applicable, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause
the applicable U.K. pound sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.K. pound sterling-denominated
restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (1) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, being refinanced _plus_ (2) the
aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting discounts, defeasance costs,
premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to
refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, being refinanced, will be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing. The principal amount of any non-interest bearing Indebtedness or other discount security
constituting Indebtedness at any date will be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a
balance sheet of the Issuer dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP.

215


-----

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or
indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated
or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be,
unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s
Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured, (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other
Indebtedness merely because it is issued or guaranteed by other obligors or secured by other collateral
or (3) secured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other secured Indebtedness merely because
it has a junior priority Lien with respect to the same collateral.

If any Indebtedness is refinanced or replaced in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a
percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, and such refinancing or replacement would cause the
percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated based on the Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA will not be deemed to be exceeded to the extent the principal amount of such obligations
secured by such newly incurred Indebtedness does not exceed the sum of (i) the principal amount of
such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus (ii) the related costs incurred or payable in connection with
such refinancing or replacement.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,

create, incur or assume any Lien upon any of its property or assets whether owned on the Issue Date or
acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is
securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except:

(1) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (x) Permitted

Liens or (y) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or
a Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured in all other cases, the Notes or the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured until such time
as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Liens; and

(2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral

Liens.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Lien (or a
portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Collateral Lien” or “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify (or
later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Lien (or any portion
thereof) among one or more clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Collateral Lien” or
“Permitted Liens,” as applicable, in a manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to this covenant will be deemed automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of each of the Liens
described in clause (1)(y) above or upon such Liens no longer attaching to assets or property of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional

216


-----

Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies.

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any

£10.0 million and (ii) 12% of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended
Test Period, unless:

(A) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially

less favorable to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries than those that would have
been obtained at such time in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis, or if in the good faith judgement
of the Board of Directors, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare such
Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial point of view; and

(B) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or

series of related Affiliate Transactions requiring aggregate payments or consideration in excess
of the greater of (i) £20.0 million and (ii) 15% of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

guarantee the payment of (i) any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under a Credit Facility
incurred under the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii) Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or any_
Guarantor, in each case, having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of the greater of
£30.0 million and 25% Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary promptly executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to

the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor:

(a) if the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee are subordinated in right of

payment to such Indebtedness, the Guarantee under the supplemental indenture will be
subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee with respect to such Indebtedness
substantially to the same extent as the Notes are subordinated to such Indebtedness; and

(b) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment

to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
with respect to such Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s
Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes,

_provided, this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed_
at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary provided, further, that such Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the
Incurrence of such Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any
Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize
certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise
required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary will not be required
to comply with clause (1) or (2) above and such Guarantee may be released at any time in the Issuer’s
sole discretion.

Each Guarantee will also be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under
_“—Guarantees.” At the Issuer’s request, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary_
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its
satisfaction.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the

226


-----

incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and
the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Collateral may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture and the applicable Security
Documents, or in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time (a) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; (b) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) to add Collateral, (d) to evidence the
succession of another Person to the Issuer or any security provider and the assumption of such successor
of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security
Documents, in each case, including in accordance with the terms under “—Merger, Amalgamation,
_Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets,” (e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance_
of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f) in any manner that does not
adversely affect Holders of the Notes in any material respect; (iii) the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement or otherwise modify or release Security
Interests with respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted
Reorganization and (iv) the Security Interests, and the related Security Documents may be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by a retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking); provided, however, that in the case of clause (iv) above, except
with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified, released or replaced unless,
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion
from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or of the person granting such Security Interest, in each case, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors or Financial Officer of the
Issuer or the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced,
are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity
or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the
event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its
satisfaction) consent to such amendments, extensions, renewals, restatements, releases, supplements,
modifications or replacements without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the_
foregoing clause (1) the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized

227


-----

Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release
of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security
Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency
of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3)
add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7)
amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof, (8) make any amendment otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, or (9)
make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding,
except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or as permitted by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer
may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein), and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at the registered office of the Issuer.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will make available to
the Holders:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year

ending December 31, 2023, annual reports containing: (i) an operating and financial discussion of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations,
and a discussion of liquidity and capital resources, material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies of the Issuer; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and (if applicable) balance
sheet information of the Issuer, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include provision of a full

228


-----

income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such
_pro forma_ information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financial information; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes
to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years, and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (iv) a brief description of the management and shareholders of the
Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; (v) a
description of material change to operational risk factors and of material subsequent events (to the extent
not provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); and (vi) adjusted EBITDA for
the year;

(2) within 75 days following the end of the first, second and third fiscal quarters in each

fiscal year of the Issuer, unaudited quarterly financial statements containing the following information:
(i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and (if applicable) balance
sheet information of the Issuer, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates (provided
that such _pro forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financial information); (iii) an operating and financial discussion of the
unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, adjusted EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iv)
a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent report; and (v)
material subsequent events (to the extent not provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (1) above
or clause (3) below); and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or

any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer or director
changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer a report containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that in the event of any natural, medical, man-made or similar catastrophe which_
prevents or otherwise unduly restricts the Issuer (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) from
furnishing the reports specified in clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph of this covenant within the time
period set out therein, the Issuer shall have the right to extend its reporting deadline up to 60 additional
days after such reporting period deadline; provided, further, that the Issuer endeavors to provide such
financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable.

The Issuer will make available such information and such reports to any Holder and to the Trustee under
the Indenture in each case by posting such information on its website. In the event the Issuer posts
copies of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant on its
website, it will be deemed to have furnished such reports to the Holders or to the extent that such
information cannot be posted to the Issuer’s website for any reason, if such information has been
delivered to the Trustee (to be made available to requesting Holders).

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a

229


-----

consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information;
_provided however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a_
change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than as set forth below). The
reports set forth above will not be required to be reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this “—Reports and
_Other Information” covenant and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed_
to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto
will be deemed to have been cured.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports and Other Information” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply
with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the
SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy
(in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available
to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would
be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the
foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the
preceding paragraphs.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act
for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer (if
such entity is different from the Issuer) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) (a) meet
the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as
if references to the Issuer therein were references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with a reasonably detailed description of material differences between
the financial condition and results of operations of such Parent and the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or
IPO Entity are listed on a Recognized Exchange and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject
to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading
on such Recognized Exchange, for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Holders
such annual reports, semi-annual reports and/or quarterly reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO
Entity is, or would be, required to file with such Recognized Exchange pursuant to the applicable
admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs; provided that
if the consolidated financial statements of any Parent or the IPO Entity (if different than the Issuer) are
included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial

230


-----

condition and results of operations of such Parent or the IPO Entity and the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be included.

It is understood that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such
information, documents or reports have been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise,

of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to

the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given

by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30.0% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause
(1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes and other than as set forth under the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Reporting”;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by

which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer made available to the Holders) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer made available to the Holders) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such

Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or
relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at
its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount

of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregate £40.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted

Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer made
available to the Holders) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of £40.0 million (net of amounts covered by insurance policies), which final judgments remain
unpaid, undischarged, unwaived and unstayed for a period of more than 90 days after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has
been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant

Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer made available to the Holders) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary);

231


-----

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in

full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of £40.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction
in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days; or

(8) the Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries

that taken together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer made available to the
Holders) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) will for any reason cease to be in full force and
effect except as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture or be declared null and void in a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or any Financial Officer of any Guarantor that
is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer made available to the Holders)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further
liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the
termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (4) or (5) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
notify the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee if given by the Holders) in writing of the default and, with
respect to clauses (4) and (5) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in
clauses (4) or (5), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer)
occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30.0% in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer may declare the principal, premium,
if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and
payable immediately.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be
due and payable immediately.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first
paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable
without further action or notice. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders
notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any,
or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in the Holders' interest. In addition, the Trustee
will have no obligation to accelerate the Notes if in the best judgment of the Trustee acceleration is not
in the best interests of the Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Trustee, may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes
waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in
the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Note held by a non-consenting
Holder and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such
rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any
Event of Default specified in clause (4) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof
(excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) will be
annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been

discharged;

232


-----

(2) the requisite holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action

(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, waived or is no

longer continuing.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless
the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture
or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is

continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested

the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably

satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof

and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given

the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture
and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to certain restrictions,
under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in
personal liability.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually within 120 days
after the end of each fiscal year a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is
required, within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a
statement specifying such Default unless such Default has been cured, waived or is no longer continuing
within such 30-day period. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver
a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such
Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection
with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Reports and Other Information” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant_
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within
the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly
complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it,
and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has
occurred.

**Financial Calculations; Measuring Compliance**

With respect to any transaction including without limitation any Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, amalgamation, joint venture, investment or other similar transaction (including a Change of
Control), incurrence, repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness or Liens, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock, or the making of a Restricted Payment, for the purposes of making a determination
as to whether any calculation of the ratios, baskets, or financial metrics, including the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Net Income, Consolidated Net Income, Adjusted
EBITDA and/or Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA and any other terms used in such ratios, baskets or
financial metrics and, whether a Default or Event of Default exists, has occurred, is continuing or would
result in connection with the foregoing or whether any condition precedent relating thereto has been
satisfied, the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, any Parent Company of the Issuer or any
successor entity of any of the foregoing or a third party (the “Testing Party”) may, at its option, use (A)
the date of consummation of the relevant transaction, (B) the date that any definitive agreement, put
option or similar arrangement in respect of such transaction is entered into, (C) the date that any
unilateral commitment or binding offer or announcement with respect to such transaction is made, or
(D) the date that any notice including with respect to any repayment, repurchase or refinancing of any
Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof as the applicable date of determination the “Determination
_Date”); in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro_
_forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” or “Adjusted_
_EBITDA”. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party elects to use the Determination Date as the_
applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any fluctuation or change in the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Net Income, Consolidated Net
Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA or other related terms in the calculation of
ratios, baskets and financial metrics of the Issuer, the target business, or assets to be acquired subsequent
to the Determination Date and prior to the consummation of such transaction, will not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in
connection with such transaction is permitted to be incurred or in connection with compliance by the
Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any other provision of the Indenture, (b) for purposes
of determining compliance with any provision which requires that no Default or Event of Default, as
applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any transaction, such condition shall be
deemed satisfied so long as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the Determination
Date, (c) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available,
the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial
metrics on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall
thereafter be deemed to be the applicable Determination Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and
financial metrics, (d) if any ratios or financial metrics or currency exchange rates improve or baskets
increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics, currency exchange
rates or baskets may be utilized, (e) until such transaction is consummated, such definitive agreements
(or other relevant documentation) are terminated or conditions in any conditional notice can no longer
be met or public announcements with respect thereto are withdrawn or there is a public announcement
to the effect that the transaction contemplated by such definitive agreements will no longer be
consummated or such transaction is otherwise abandoned (each as determined by the Testing Party),
such transaction and all transactions proposed to be undertaken in connection therewith (including the
incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens) will be given pro forma effect when determining compliance of
other transactions (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens unrelated to such transaction)
that are consummated after the Determination Date and on or prior to the consummation of such
transaction and any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof and Liens) will be deemed to have occurred on the Determination Date and be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the Determination
Date and before the date of consummation of such transaction and (f) Consolidated Interest Expense
and Fixed Charges for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an
assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin (without giving effect to any step-ups)
contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such

234


-----

indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party in good faith until such
time as any such margin is fixed by definitive financing documentation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with a Testing Party’s election to use a
Determination Date in connection with a transaction, any reference to “date of incurrence, “time of
_incurrence,” “date of determination” or other similar phrases with respect to the date or time an action_
is taken or when a calculation with respect to taking such action is made herein will mean the
Determination Date.

In the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is
incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken on the same date that any
other item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred
or issued, any other Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken, then the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio and Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated with respect to such incurrence,
issuance or other transaction without regard to any other incurrence, issuance or transaction. Each item
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred
and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the
extent available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio. In the event Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any
ratio-based basket such action will be deemed incurred under the ratio-based portion of such basket and
shall not utilize any dollar-based portion of such basket.

Any action (including the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
the incurrence of Lien incurred, the making of an Asset Sale, Restricted Payment or Investment and
each other transaction undertaken) that is incurred, issued or taken pursuant to a basket based on RunRate Adjusted EBITDA will be deemed incurred under the basket based on Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA and shall not utilize any dollar-based portion of such basket.

To the extent the date of delivery of any document required to be delivered pursuant to any provision
of the Indenture falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable date of delivery shall be deemed
to be the next succeeding Business Day.

For purposes of determining the maturity date of any Indebtedness, customary bridge loans, extendable
bridge loans or other interim debt subject to customary conditions that would be extended as, converted
into or required to be exchanged for permanent refinancing either automatically or subject to customary
conditions (including no payment or bankruptcy event of default) shall be deemed to have the maturity
date as so extended, converted or exchanged.

For purposes of covenant compliance, the amount of any Investment shall be the amount actually
invested, without adjustment for subsequent increases or decreases in the value of such Investment but
giving effect to any returns or distributions of capital or repayment of principal actually received in cash
by such Person with respect thereto.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, so long as an action was taken (or not taken) in reliance
upon a basket, ratio or financial metric that was calculated or determined in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or any Parent Company of the Issuer based upon financial
information available to such officer at such time and such action (or inaction) was permitted under the
Indenture at the time of such calculation or determination, any subsequent restatement, modification or
adjustments made to such financial information (including any restatement, modification or adjustment
that would have caused such basket or ratio to be exceeded as a result of such action or inaction) shall
not result in any Default or Event of Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or equity holder of
the Issuer or any Guarantor or any Parent Company (other than, with respect to members, partners and

235


-----

equity holders, the Issuer and the Guarantors) will have any liability for any obligation of the Issuer or
the Guarantors under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture will terminate (other than certain
obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer may, at its option
and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes of
a series and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee of such series of
Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default with respect to such series of
Notes except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if

any, and interest on the Notes of such series when such payments are due solely out of the trust created
pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes of such series concerning issuing

temporary Notes of such series, registration of such Notes of such series, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes of such series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s

obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and
the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate with respect to such series of Notes (other
than with respect to the defeasance trust).

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations will not
constitute a Default with respect to the Notes of a series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs,
certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining
to the Issuer) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event
of Default with respect to the Notes of such series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes of the
applicable series:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the

Holders, cash in U.K. pound sterling, pound sterling-denominated UK Government Securities, euros,
euro-denominated European Government Securities or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will
be sufficient, in the opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, to pay the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest due on the Notes on the stated maturity date or on the applicable redemption dates, as
the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes of the applicable series,
and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes of the applicable series are being defeased to maturity
or to a particular redemption date; _provided, upon any redemption that requires the payment of the_
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date
of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the
“Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of

236


-----

redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit will be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to
the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an

Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions:

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States

Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the issuance of the Notes of the applicable series, there has been a change

in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel will confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial holders of the Notes of the applicable series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, as a result of
such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an

Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial
holders of the Notes of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to such tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such

deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the
granting of Liens and the consummation of other transactions in connection therewith) will have
occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation

of, or constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility or any other material agreement,
instrument or documents (other than the Indenture) to which, the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or
by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds
to be applied to make the deposit required to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and
any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of
Liens and the consummation of other transactions in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the

deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any
creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of

Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Opinion of Counsel required by the immediately preceding
paragraph with respect to legal defeasance need not be delivered if all of the Notes of the applicable
series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable or (ii)
will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee
in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer.

237


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and will cease to
be of further effect as to all Notes of a series, when either:

(1) all such Notes of the applicable series theretofore authenticated and delivered, except

lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money
has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all such Notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for

cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of one or more notices of
redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one year or may be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor
has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed by the Issuer for this purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
Holders, cash in U.K. pound sterling, pound sterling-denominated UK Government Securities, euros,
euro-denominated European Government Securities or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will
be sufficient (without consideration of any reinvestment of interest) to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on, such Notes to the date of such
maturity or redemption; provided, (i) upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium of such applicable series of Notes, the amount deposited will be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed by the Issuer for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium of such
applicable series of Notes calculated as of the date of such notice of redemption, with any Applicable
Premium Deficit of such applicable series of Notes only required to be deposited with the Trustee (or
such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer for this purpose) on or prior to such
date of redemption and (ii) any Applicable Premium Deficit of such applicable series of Notes will be
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit will be applied toward
such redemption;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the

Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the

deposited money toward the payment of the Notes of the applicable series at maturity or the
redemption date, as the case may be; provided that, if requested by the Issuer to the Trustee and
Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or
pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than 5 business days prior to
such distribution, the Trustee (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the
Issuer for this purpose) will distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to
maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, further that (i) the cash shall
otherwise be distributed to Holders in accordance with the terms of any redemption notice or
other applicable repayment provisions, (ii) the Notes of the applicable series shall be marked
down on the date of repayment of the Holders, (iii) the Holders of the applicable series of Notes
shall receive the principal, interest and premia (and any other amounts) as required in
accordance with the terms of the redemption notice or other applicable repayment provisions
and (iv) the paying agent will be advised at least two Business Days prior to any date elected
for early repayment and such early repayment will not occur on or prior to the record date set
for redemption. To the extent such Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a
depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a
participant of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of the
clearing system.

238


-----

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge with respect to the Notes of the
applicable series have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Notes Documents may be amended or
supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes, and any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture
or the Notes issued thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer or offer to purchase
with respect to the Notes); provided that (x) if any such amendment or waiver will only affect one series
of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent
of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including,
in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes) shall be
required and (y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner
different and materially adverse relative to the manner such amendment or waiver affects other series
of Notes, then the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such
adversely affected series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with
a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes) shall be required.

The Indenture will provide that with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder an
amendment or waiver may not, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or in the case

Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent of Holders holding not less than
90% (or in the case of clauses (10 and (11), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes

affect a series of Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to the manner such
amendment or waiver affects other series of Notes, then the consent of Holders holding not less than
90% (or in the case of clauses (10 and (11), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults;

Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the applicable Security Documents,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture
to which it is a party), the Security Agent and the Trustee may amend or supplement any Notes
Document without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes

(provided, that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of

Security Documents, Guarantee or Notes;

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and

legending of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, to facilitate the issuance and administration

being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (b) such
amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(11) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the

Indenture;

(12) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a

security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged
or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the
extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that
the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or_

(13) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series
of Notes have taken action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes
will be deemed to be the sterling equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i)
the record date in respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such
action) or (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount
of such Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Issuer (if no such record date has been set).

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an
amendment authorized by clause (8) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be
duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any
other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer
and the Trustee.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication or electronic delivery will be deemed given on the first date on which
publication is made or electronic delivery made, and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing or transmitting. Notices given in accordance with
the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream will be deemed given on the date sent to Euroclear and
Clearstream.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become
a creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions; _however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must_
eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide
that if an Event of Default of which notice has been provided to the Trustee in accordance with the
Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee is required, in the exercise of its power, to use the
degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee is under no

241


-----

obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless
such Holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law and the
Security Documents will be governed by English law, Danish law or Swiss law, as applicable.

or reserve that has been added back to Consolidated Net Income in calculating Adjusted
EBITDA in accordance with this definition), and

“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Test Period, the ratio of (1) Run
Rate Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for such Test Period to (2) the Fixed Charges of the Issuer for
such Test Period. In the event that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees,
redeems, repays, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid
under any revolving credit facility or line of credit unless such Indebtedness has been permanently
repaid and not replaced) or issues, repurchases or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, in
each case, subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

256


-----

is being calculated but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving _pro forma_ effect to such incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness or such issuance,
repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the most recently ended Test Period; provided, however, that at the election of the Issuer,
the pro forma calculation will not give effect to any Indebtedness incurred on such determination date
pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Specified Transaction that has been
made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary during any Test Period or subsequent to such Test
Period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date
will be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Specified Transactions (and the change
in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA resulting
therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the Test Period. If since the beginning of such Test Period
any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or
consolidated with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Test Period
will have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for
such Test Period as if such Specified Transaction had occurred at the beginning of the most recently
ended Test Period.

For purposes of this definition in the Indenture, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to any
Specified Transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations will be made in good
faith by a Financial Officer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run-rate” cost
savings, synergies and operating expense reductions resulting from or related to any such Specified
Transaction (including the Transactions) which is being given pro forma effect that have been realized
or are expected to be realized and for which the actions necessary to realize such cost savings, operating
expense reductions and synergies are taken, committed to be taken or with respect to which substantial
steps have been taken or are expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of any such
Specified Transaction (in each case as though such cost savings, synergies and operating expense
reductions had been realized on the first day of the applicable period and as if such cost savings,
synergies and operating expense reductions were realized for the entirety of such period). For the
purposes of the Indenture, “run-rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated
with any action taken, committed to be taken, or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken
or are expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public
target’s compliance costs with public company requirements), net of the amount of actual benefits
realized during such period from such actions. For the purpose of determining Adjusted EBITDA and
Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma effect shall be given on the same basis as for calculating the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on
such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging
Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation will be deemed
to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a Financial Officer to be the rate of interest
implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that
may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, will be deemed to have been based upon the rate
actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. For
purposes of this definition in the Indenture, any amount in a currency other than U.K. pound sterling
will be converted to U.K. pound sterling based on the average exchange rate for such currency for the
most recent twelve month period immediately prior to the date of determination in a manner consistent
with that used in calculating Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable Test Period.

“GAAP” means International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the

European Union or the United Kingdom or any variation thereon with which the Issuer or its Restricted

ratios, calculations and determinations based upon IFRS to be calculated or made, as the case may be,
pursuant to the Indenture, unless the Issuer elects to use IFRS. At any time after the Issue Date, the
Issuer may elect to fix GAAP with respect to any (or all) GAAP terms as of a specified date. After the
Issue Date, the Issuer may elect to apply US GAAP accounting principles in lieu of GAAP and, upon
any such election, references herein to GAAP will thereafter be construed to mean US GAAP (except
as otherwise provided in the Indenture); provided, any such election, once made, will be irrevocable;
_provided,_ _further, any calculation or determination in the Indenture that requires the application of_
GAAP for periods that include fiscal quarters ended prior to the Issuer’s election to apply US GAAP
will remain as previously calculated or determined in accordance with GAAP,

_provided, further again, that the Issuer may only make such election if it also elects to report_
any subsequent financial reports required to be made by the Issuer under US GAAP. The Issuer will
give notice of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. Notwithstanding
any other provision contained herein the amount of any Indebtedness under GAAP with respect to
Capitalized Lease Obligations shall be determined in accordance with the definition of Capitalized
Lease Obligations.

such statistics are no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most
nearly equal to the period from the date of such redemption notice to        , 2025; _provided,_
_however, that if the period from the date of such redemption notice to         , 2025 is less than one_

For purposes of determining compliance with this definition, (1) a Lien need not be incurred solely by
reference to one category of Permitted Collateral Liens described in this definition but is permitted to
be incurred in part under any combination thereof and of any other available exemption and (2) in the
event that a Lien (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted
Collateral Liens, the Issuer will, in its sole discretion, be entitled to divide, classify or reclassify, in
whole or in part, any such Lien (or any portion thereof) among one or more such categories or clauses
in any manner that complies with this definition.

If any Liens securing obligations are incurred to refinance liens securing obligations initially incurred
in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, and such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated
based on the Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Run-Rate
Adjusted EBITDA will not be deemed to be exceeded to the extent the principal amount of such
obligations secured by such newly incurred Lien does not exceed the principal amount of such
obligations secured by such Liens being refinanced, plus the related costs incurred or payable in
connection with such financing and if any Liens securing obligations are incurred to refinance liens
securing obligations initially incurred in reliance on a basket measured by a fixed U.K. pound sterling
amount, such fixed U.K. pound sterling basket will be deemed to be exceeded to the extent the principal
amount of such obligations secured by such Liens being refinanced, plus the related costs incurred or

For purposes of this definition, the term “Indebtedness” will be deemed to include interest on such
Indebtedness.

with the requirements of the Indenture (or would have required a Change of Control Offer in the absence

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Euro Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Euro
**Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered**
form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Euro Global Notes”).

The Sterling Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A
**Sterling Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Euro Notes, the “Rule 144A Notes”) under the**
U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Sterling Global Notes” and, together with the Rule
144A Euro Global Notes, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of
Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking
S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary. The Euro
Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation
**S Euro Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in**
registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Euro Global
**Notes”).**

The Sterling Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the
“Regulation S Sterling Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Euro Notes, the “Regulation S
**Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered**
form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Sterling Global Notes” and,
together with the Regulation S Euro Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation
S Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The
Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global
**Notes.”**

Except as set forth below, the Euro Global Notes will only be issued in registered, global form in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and the Sterling
Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this Offering only against payment in immediately
available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and in
ownership interests the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through
such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture
governing the Notes and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws
of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing
limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while
the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have received the Notes registered
in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

284


-----

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents and neither the Registrar nor the
Transfer Agent nor the Paying Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will
surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption,
the Common Depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the
applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result
of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such
Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable,
in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands
that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be
redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair
and appropriate; _provided,_ _however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal_
amount (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) or £100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Sterling
Global Notes) may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Common Depositary or its
nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts
without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be
made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuer
will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder
of the Global Notes after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder
would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note absent such withholding or deduction.
The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments
by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holders of the
Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owners
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the
Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Registrar, Paying Agent or Transfer Agent nor any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

285


-----

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in such Euro Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Sterling Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Sterling Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream
in pound sterling.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor
the Registrar, Paying Agent or Transfer Agent nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective
agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in
connection with any such payment.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive
registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules
and procedures may change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer
**Restrictions.”**

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing
on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the

286


-----

principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount
of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global
Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules
and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility
for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants
of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes if:

- Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor within 120 days; or

- the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current
procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to
all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Transfer
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof
and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note,
a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new
Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be
issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a
denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof (in the case of a
Definitive Registered Note relating to the Euro Notes) and minimum denominations of £100,000 and

287


-----

in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to
the Sterling Notes) will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and
delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally
payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated
and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the
Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s
requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee
and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may
charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer
**Restrictions.”**

**Global clearance and settlement under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Euro Notes will be made in euros and initial settlement for the Sterling Notes
will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts
will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors
who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes,
on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in
Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

288


-----

**_Clearing information_**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes are
set out under “Listing and General Information.”

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for
these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their
participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface
with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are
financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and
certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account
holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the
Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear
and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take
such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or
would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive
distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax_
_consequences, under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes_
_including without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale_
_or redemption of Notes or any interest therein._

**Certain United Kingdom tax considerations**

The following is a summary of the current United Kingdom law and published HM Revenue and
Customs (“HMRC”) practice (which may not be binding on HMRC) on the date hereof relating only
to the United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest in respect of the Notes, both
of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect. The comments do not deal with
other United Kingdom tax aspects of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. It applies only to the
position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and does not deal with certain
classes of persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to
whom special rules may apply. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes
depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. The following is
a general guide for information purposes and should be treated with appropriate caution. It is not
intended as tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be
relevant to a prospective purchaser. Holders of Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position should
consult with their professional advisers. Holders of Notes who may be liable to taxation in jurisdictions
other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes are
particularly advised to consult their professional adviser as to whether they are so liable (and if so under
the laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only to certain United Kingdom
taxation aspects of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, holders of Notes should be aware
that they may be liable to taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect
of the Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account
of taxation under the laws of the United Kingdom.

**Interest on the Notes**

**_Payment of interest on the Notes_**

Interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction for or on account of United
Kingdom income tax provided the Notes carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on a
“recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The
International Stock Exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” for these purposes. Securities such as
the Notes will be treated as listed on The International Stock Exchange if they are included in the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on The International Stock
Exchange.

In other cases, absent any other relief or exemption, an amount must generally be withheld from
payments of interest on the Notes on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently
20%). However, where an applicable double taxation treaty provides for a lower rate of withholding tax
(or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a holder of Notes, HMRC can issue a direction to the Issuer
to pay interest to the holder of Notes without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid with tax deducted
at the lower rate provided for in the relevant double taxation treaty).

The references to “interest” in this description of United Kingdom taxation mean “interest” as
understood in United Kingdom tax law. The statements do not take any account of any different
definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail under any other law or which may be created
by the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation. In particular, where Notes are
to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount, then any such
element of premium may be treated as a payment of interest for United Kingdom tax purposes and may
accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor in respect of interest on
the Notes (or in respect of other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts
subscribed for such Notes) is uncertain. In particular, such payments may be subject to United Kingdom
withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief as may be available under the
provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or any other exemption which may apply and such
payments by a Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemptions from the obligation to withhold tax
described in the paragraphs above.

**_Further United Kingdom tax issues_**

Where interest has been paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax, holders of Notes who
are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is
an appropriate provision in any applicable double taxation treaty.

Interest on the Notes should constitute United Kingdom source income for United Kingdom tax
purposes. Accordingly, and subject to certain exceptions applying to various categories of investors
(including, in particular, exceptions applying to persons not resident in the United Kingdom), holders
of Notes may be subject to United Kingdom tax by way of assessment (including self-assessment) on
such payments of interest even when paid without withholding for United Kingdom tax.

Holders of Notes may wish to note that, in certain circumstances, HMRC have powers to obtain certain
information relating to the Notes, including in relation to interest and other payments derived from the
Notes. This may include details of the beneficial owners of the Notes, the persons for whom the Notes
are held and the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid. Information
may be obtained from a range of persons, including registrars, the registered holders of the Notes,
persons who make, receive or are entitled to receive payments derived from the Notes and persons by
or through whom interest and payments treated as interest are paid or credited. These provisions will
apply whether or not the interest has been paid subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of
United Kingdom income tax and whether or not a holder of Notes is resident in the United Kingdom
for United Kingdom taxation purposes. Information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax
authorities in other jurisdictions. The above description of the United Kingdom withholding tax position
assumes that there will be no substitution of the Issuer and does not consider the tax consequences of
any such substitution.

**Certain United States federal income tax considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport
to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary is limited to considerations relevant
to a U.S. Holder (as defined below) and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such
as estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion is based on the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities
may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may
be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not
sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be
no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is
limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price”
within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of

291


-----

the applicable series of Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion also does not address any
holders who are having their Existing Notes redeemed in the Refinancing. This discussion does not
address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances,
including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not
address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

- U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

- persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

- U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of
a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

- banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

- real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

- brokers, dealers or traders in securities;

- S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect
to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;

- persons that are resident or ordinarily resident in or have a permanent establishment in a
jurisdiction outside the United States to which income from the notes is attributable;

- tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and

- persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation or an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

- a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a
valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of
the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding
the Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE
APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR
SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP

-----

AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS
(INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL
OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

**Payments of qualified stated interest**

Payments of qualified stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld (see “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”)) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such_
payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Qualified stated interest generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least
annually at a single fixed rate. The stated interest on the Notes will qualify as “qualified stated interest.”

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of qualified stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency interest payment (determined based on
the spot rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency gain or loss
on the receipt of such qualified stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the
actual disposition of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of qualified
stated interest income that has accrued with respect to the Notes during an accrual period. The
U.S. dollar value of such accrued qualified stated interest will generally be determined by translating
such amount of foreign currency at the average spot rate for the accrual period or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within the
applicable taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate such
accrued qualified stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate on the last day of the interest
accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate on
the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the
date of receipt of the accrued qualified stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described
in the prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt of the qualified
stated interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder
and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the date such interest is received equal to the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (determined
based on the spot rate on the date such qualified stated interest is received) and the U.S. dollar value of
qualified stated interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above),
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange
gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit
purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**Foreign tax credit**

Qualified stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally
will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to
U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a
U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits, and recently issued U.S. Treasury Regulations may
further restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the withholding tax imposed by

293


-----

the foreign jurisdiction. However, a recent notice from the IRS indicates that the U.S. Department of
the Treasury (“Treasury”) and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to such Treasury
Regulations and allows, subject to certain conditions, taxpayers to defer the application of many aspects
of such Treasury Regulations for taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2023 (the notice also
indicates that the Treasury and the IRS are considering whether, and under what conditions, to provide
additional temporary relief for later taxable years). U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid qualified stated
interest, which will be taxable to the extent not previously included in income as described above under
“Tax Considerations—Payments of qualified stated interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis
in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note, reduced
by any cash payments received on the Note (other than qualified stated interest).

The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of cash plus the fair market value of all other property
received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or
other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized will be translated into U.S. dollars based on the
spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market,
a cash basis U.S. Holder and an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value
of such foreign currency based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an
accrual basis U.S. Holder makes this election, the election must be applied consistently by such holder
from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder
that has not made the settlement date election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (as
ordinary income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based
on the spot rate on the date of settlement) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized
(based on the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition).

A U.S. Holder will also recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal
of a Note (taxable as ordinary income or loss) upon the sale or other taxable disposition of the Note
equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price of the
Note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder
acquired the Note. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to principal, together
with any foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued qualified stated interest, if any,
(which will be treated as discussed above under “Tax Considerations—Payments of qualified stated
_interest”) will be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable_
disposition by a U.S. Holder, and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss.

Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale
or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or
loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than
one year. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should
consult its own tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.

**Information reporting and backup withholding**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to
the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note paid to a
U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, provides evidence of
such exemption. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to U.S. federal backup
withholding with respect to payments on the Notes and the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition
of the Notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and

294


-----

certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that it is not subject to backup withholding and
otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a
U.S. Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and
may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a
timely manner.

**Tax return disclosure requirements**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving
rise to losses in excess of an applicable threshold amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a
sale or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a
foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to
file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets”
generally are required to file an information report on IRS Form 8938 with respect to such assets with
their tax returns. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of
the foregoing rules. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to
these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.
U.S. holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties, and,
in such circumstances, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax could be suspended, in whole or
part.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**Certain Danish tax considerations**

If a Guarantor incorporated in Denmark makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes, it is
possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief
as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other
exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for
all or any of the exemptions described above. Further, Holders of Notes who are resident in Denmark
will be subject to taxation in Denmark of interest payments and capital gains.

**Certain Swiss Tax Considerations**

**_Swiss Federal Withholding Tax_**

Payments by the Issuer, of interest on, and repayment of principal of, the Notes, will not be subject to
Swiss federal withholding tax, provided that the Issuer is at all times resident and managed outside
Switzerland for Swiss tax purposes.

**_Swiss Federal Stamp Taxes_**

The issue and redemption of the Notes by the Issuer are not subject to Swiss federal issuance stamp
duty or Swiss federal transfer stamp duty.

Purchases or sales of Notes with a maturity in excess of 12 months where a Swiss domestic bank or a
Swiss domestic securities dealer (as defined in the Swiss federal stamp duty act) is a party, or acts as an
intermediary, to the transaction may be subject to Swiss federal stamp duty on dealings in securities
(Umsatzabgabe) at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent. of the purchase price of the Notes. Where both the seller

295


-----

and the purchaser of Notes are non-residents of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein, no
Swiss federal stamp duty on dealing in securities (Umsatzabgabe) is payable.

The issue of the Guarantees by the Guarantors is not subject to Swiss federal stamp duty.

**_Income Taxation on Principal or Interest_**

_Notes held by non-Swiss Noteholders_

Payments by the Issuer or Guarantor of interest and repayment of principal to, and gain realized on the
sale or redemption of Notes by, a holder of Notes who is not a resident of Switzerland and who during
the relevant taxation year has not engaged in a trade or business through a permanent establishment or
a fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the Notes are attributable and who is not subject to
income taxation in Switzerland for any other reason will not be subject to any Swiss federal, cantonal
or communal income tax.

_Notes held by Swiss holders as private assets_

An individual who resides in Switzerland and holds Notes as private assets is required to include all
payments of interest received on such Notes (as well as any original issue discounts or repayment
premiums related thereto) as taxable income in his or her personal income tax return for the relevant
tax period (in each case converted into Swiss francs at the exchange rate prevailing at the relevant times)
and is taxable on the total net taxable income for such tax period at the then prevailing tax rates.

Swiss resident individuals who sell or otherwise dispose of Notes held as private assets realize either a
tax-free private capital gain or a non-tax-deductible capital loss. See “Tax Considerations—Certain
_Swiss Tax Considerations—Income Taxation on Principal or Interest—Notes held as Swiss business_
_assets” below for a summary on the tax treatment of individuals classified as “professional securities_
dealers.”

_Notes held as Swiss business assets_

Individuals who hold Notes as business assets in Switzerland and Swiss resident corporate taxpayers
and corporate taxpayers resident abroad holding Notes through a permanent establishment in
Switzerland are required to recognize payments of interest in respect of the Notes and any capital gain
or loss realized on the sale or other disposal of Notes (in each case converted into Swiss francs at the
exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment or sale), as applicable, in their income statement, as the
case may be, for the permanent establishment in Switzerland, for the respective tax period, and will be
taxable on total net taxable earnings (if any), as the case may be, attributable to the permanent
establishment Switzerland, for such period. The same taxation treatment also applies to Swiss-resident
individuals who, for income tax purposes, are classified as “professional securities dealers” for reasons
of, inter alia, frequent dealings and leveraged transactions in securities.

_Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_

Switzerland has concluded an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. to facilitate the
implementation of FATCA. The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss
financial institutions are disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account
holder or by means of group requests within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will
not be transferred automatically in the absence of consent, and instead will be exchanged only within
the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the double taxation agreement between the
U.S. and Switzerland. In this regard, on July 17, 2019, the U.S. Senate approved the 2009 protocol (the
“Protocol”) amending the double taxation agreement regarding income tax between Switzerland and
the U.S. (the “amended DTA”). The Protocol had been approved by the Swiss Federal Assembly on
June 18, 2010. On September 20, 2019, Switzerland and the U.S. exchanged the instruments of
ratification of the Protocol. With the exchange of the ratification instruments, the amended DTA
formally entered into force. The Protocol introduces a mechanism for the exchange of information upon

296


-----

request in tax matters between Switzerland and the United States, which is in line with international
standards, and allows the United States to make group requests under FATCA concerning nonconsenting U.S. accounts and non-consenting non-participating foreign financial institutions. On
October 8, 2014, the Swiss Federal Council approved a mandate for negotiations with the U.S. on
changing the current direct-notification-based regime to a regime where the relevant information is sent
to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which in turn provides the information to the U.S. tax
authorities.

_Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters_

Switzerland has concluded a multilateral agreement with the European Union on the international
automatic exchange of information (the “AEOI”) in tax matters. The agreement became effective as of
January 1, 2017, and applies to all 27 EU member states and also Gibraltar. On November 19, 2014,
Switzerland signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (the “MCAA”). The MCAA is
based on article 6 of the OECD/Council of Europe administrative assistance convention and is intended
to ensure the uniform implementation of Automatic Exchange of Information (the “AEOI”). The
Federal Act on the International Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (the “AEOI Act”)
entered into force on January 1, 2017. The AEOI Act is the legal basis for the implementation of the
AEOI standard in Switzerland.

The AEOI is being introduced in Switzerland through bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements.
The agreements have, and will be, concluded on the basis of guaranteed reciprocity, compliance with
the principle of specialty (i.e. the information exchanged may only be used to assess and levy taxes (and
for criminal tax proceedings)) and adequate data protection.

Based on such multilateral or bilateral agreements and the implementing laws of Switzerland,
Switzerland exchanges data in respect of financial assets, including, as the case may be, Notes, held in,
and income derived thereon and credited to, accounts or deposits with a paying agent in Switzerland for
the benefit of individuals resident in a EU member state or in a treaty state.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND**

**THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the security interests being provided for the Notes, and a summary of certain insolvency law_
_considerations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or_
_organized. The description below is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete or to discuss_
_all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes or the_
_Guarantees or security interests being provided for the relevant series of Notes. Prospective investors_
_in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

Some of the Guarantors are incorporated and organized under the laws of member states of the European
Union.

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/2260 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of December 15, 2021, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published
in the Official Gazette of the European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency
proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (the “Member
**State”) (other than Denmark) within which the centre of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The**
“centre of main interests,” (“COMI”). COMI is defined as “the place where the company conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.”

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the COMI of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the COMI being at the place of the registered office
should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the
one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of
management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other
Member State. COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time, but is determined for
the purposes of deciding which court has competent jurisdiction to open main proceedings at the time
of the request. The determination of COMI will be a question of fact on which the courts of Members
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

If the COMI of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State
(other than Denmark), the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings in respect of that company under the Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have opened in accordance with Article 3 shall
have jurisdiction for any action that derives from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with
them, such as avoidance actions.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other Member State (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in other Member States. If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than
Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other
than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings against

298


-----

that company only if such company has an “establishment” (in the territory of such other Member
State). Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Insolvency
Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial
proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main
insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the
main proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company
carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of territorial
proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company which are
situated in such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State
in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can
only be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment
and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s
COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of
such establishment or a public authority which has the right to request such opening under the respective
Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain
exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has
assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the
case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the officeholder appointed by the court of the
main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another
Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member
State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that
other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open
insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets. However, under
Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main proceedings may
prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a
unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary
proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to = comply
with the distribution and priority rights under national law from which the local creditors would benefit
if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such
undertaking, must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a “qualified majority” (as defined
under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from
or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the
Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is located), determined in accordance with applicable local
laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open
secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately
protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings,
may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months,
provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to
three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the

299


-----

process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency
proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision
may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may
affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by
any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the
respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each
other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions
will be applied in relation to one another.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event
that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate
with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to
the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall
also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning
another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective
administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not
entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party,
provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer, and certain of the Guarantors, are companies incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales (each, an “English Obligor”). Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of these
entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law. The point at
which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or an English Guarantor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

The English Obligors’ obligations under the Notes are secured by security interests over the Collateral.
English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an
English Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The principal sources of English insolvency laws are the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (“Insolvency
**Act”) and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. In addition, the Companies Act 2006 sets**
out statutory procedures which can be utilized to effect a compromise, or other arrangement, between
a company and its creditors and/or members. Recent reforms to the English insolvency and restructuring
regime were introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act (“CIG Act”), which came
into force on June 26, 2020.

The scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency (and restructuring)
proceedings available in England and Wales, which are set out in further detail below. To the extent
that any of the English Obligors have any assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters
into insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is
likely to be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a matter for the private international
law of the relevant jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring
_proceedings” below)._

300


-----

However, insolvency proceedings in relation to the English Obligors could also be opened in a country
other than England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction
in which those insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has
its COMI in a member state of the EU, then, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to
certain exceptions, insolvency proceedings in relation to that debtor could be opened in the relevant EU
member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales such proceedings
could be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings would not benefit from
automatic recognition in England, although the foreign officeholder could make an application for
recognition under the CBIR06 (see “Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006” below).

It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings in respect of an English
Guarantor would be brought.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency and restructuring laws
relating to certain limitations on the English guarantee and the security interests over the Collateral
granted by the Issuer and the English Guarantors. The application of these laws could adversely affect
investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the English guarantee and/or the Collateral securing
the Notes and the UK guarantee and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an
insolvency of the Issuer or an English Guarantor.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain
Collateral owned by the English Obligors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively
disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating
charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the
floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no
restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general
costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing
to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an
insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets
(including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to
a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general
costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of
the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c)
an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without
the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same
priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d)
where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”
(generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market
debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations
2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security
are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for
unsecured creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback”
risks in relation to floating charge security.

301


-----

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to
be created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as
the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than re-characterized as floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of
control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof
and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging
company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion
and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in
question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration_**

An English company can enter administration in two ways: (i) an administrator can be appointed out of
court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (as discussed further
below), or (ii)an application may be made to the court by the company, its directors or one or more
creditors and the court may make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant
company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is
reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its
debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets
is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities).
Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s
statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 for a period of three weeks after receipt of the statutory
demand at the company’s registered office or to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively:
rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better
result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into an immediate liquidation
or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole
are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential
creditors.

During an administration, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that in general no proceedings or
other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company and no security interest over
any of the company’s property (save for eligible arrangements under the Financial Collateral
Regulations) may be enforced, except with leave of the court or consent of the administrator. However,
certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize
their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium by
virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise
arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are
appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a
company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The proceeds of the
realization of any property subject to a floating charge will be applied in satisfaction of the claims of
preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below) before
any distribution of proceeds is made to holders of a floating charge. An administrator may also, with
prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the
property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net
proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge
holder.

302


-----

**_Qualifying floating charge_**

If an English Obligor grants a qualifying floating charge to a party then, for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint or an administrator out of court (see “Administration”
above) or an administrative receiver (see “Administrative Receivership” below) and, in the case of the
ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security
document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act as
amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers.
In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, a qualifying floating charge must be created by an
instrument which (a) states that on its face that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act
applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c)
purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by
Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or
substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such security
interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the
security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there
is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this
test.

**_Administrative receivership_**

As noted above, administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only
available in very limited circumstances. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as
defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes (a) is or forms part of a “capital
market arrangement” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act), (b) creates a debt of at least £50.0 million
for the relevant company under the arrangement and (c) the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital
market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt
instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out-of-court
procedure), and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an
administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of
the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain
floating charges – see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the
assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed
charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand
made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a
liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge
receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral
arrangement, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration”
above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed,
meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an
administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other

303


-----

words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may
also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any
preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/winding up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency
Act (see “Priority on insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory
liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary
liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two
voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation,
the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the
following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent
company is that it is unable to pay its debts (see “Administration” above).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created
or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral
Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.
Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it
is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a
winding-up order is made by the court a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed.
No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without leave of the court and
subject to such terms as the court may impose.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of
a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result,
there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case
of a voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to
apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools available under English
law which an English Obligor may be subject to and which may adversely affect investors and their
ability to enforce their rights. These include schemes of arrangements and restructuring plans under the
Companies Act 2006 and creditor voluntary arrangements under the Insolvency Act.

_Scheme of arrangement_

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s
liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) provided such company is
liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act (see “Liquidation/Winding-Up” above) and, in the
context of a foreign company, such company has a “sufficient connection” to the England and Wales,
provided it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the scheme of arrangement is likely to be
recognized in the jurisdictions in which the company carries on substantial business (i.e. where it has
substantial assets or operations). Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement,

304


-----

affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a
single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by
the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75%
or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote
in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected
creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where
the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger
a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

_Restructuring plan_

The CIG Act has introduced a new restructuring plan procedure under Part 26A of the Companies Act
2006. A company can propose a restructuring plan to its creditors (or any specific classes of creditors
and/or its shareholders). Similar to a scheme of arrangement, creditors will be divided into classes based
on the similarity or otherwise of their rights prior to the restructuring plan and following implementation
of the plan. The court must approve the class formation and the convening of restructuring plan
meetings. Creditors whose rights are affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to
participate in the meeting and vote on the plan but there is no need to include creditors whose rights are
not affected. Furthermore, a court may exclude even a creditor whose rights are affected where it is
satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company. Each
class under the plan will then vote on whether they accept the plan and provided that sufficient creditors
approve the plan and the court considers it a proper exercise of its discretion to sanction the plan, then
the plan will be binding on all creditors regardless of whether they, individually or as a class, approved
the plan.

However, there are two additional conditions a company must meet in order to use a restructuring plan:
(a) the company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties that are affecting,
or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (b) a compromise or
arrangement must be proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) and the
purpose of such compromise or arrangement must be to eliminate, reduce, prevent or mitigate the effect
of any of the financial difficulties the company is facing.

To be capable of being sanctioned by the court, 75% in value of creditors present and voting (in person
or by proxy) in each class must agree to the compromise or arrangement (there is no numerosity
requirement in a restructuring plan). However, where there are dissenting classes of creditors who do
not vote in favor of the plan, the court has to discretion to still sanction the plan and effect a “cross class
cramdown” across the creditor groups provided that (a) the court is satisfied that none of the dissenting
classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative”
(referred to below); and (b) the plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% in value of a class
of creditors, present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine
economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. The relevant alternative is
whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the compromise
or arrangement were not sanctioned by the court.

The restructuring plan must then be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will
also review the fairness of the restructuring plan and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan.

305


-----

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a
moratorium on claims or proceedings.

**_Company voluntary arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and
creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors.
Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision
procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal
(notwithstanding the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents). A company
voluntary arrangement cannot affect the rights of secured or preferred creditors, except with their
consent.

A company is eligible to propose a company voluntary arrangement proposal if it is: (a) a company
registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland; (b) a company
incorporated in an EEA State, or (c) a company not incorporated in an EEA State but having its COMI
in a member state other than Denmark.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least
75 per cent (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, a majority
(by value) of the company’s members and no more than 50 per cent (by value) of unconnected creditors
may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a
secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is under secured. A secured creditor who proves in the
company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger
a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed
by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction,
proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and
conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

_Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006_

One of the key insolvency-related frameworks for legislation is the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions (in certain
cases, with modification), including the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was
implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “CBIR06”). For
current purposes, the relevance of the CBIR06 is in allowing assistance to be sought in Great Britain by
a foreign court or a foreign representative in connection with foreign insolvency proceedings. This may
be relevant to the extent that the English Guarantors have non-UK assets and/or foreign creditors which
may be subject to foreign proceedings or to the extent that the Issuer or any of the non-English
subsidiary guarantors which may be subject to foreign proceedings have a UK presence.

The CBIR06 provide for the recognition of two types of foreign proceedings (defined to be collective
judicial or administrative proceedings in a foreign state, including an interim proceeding pursuant to a
law relating to insolvency in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the company are subject to
control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation):

(i) “foreign main proceedings,” which can be opened in the state in

which the company has its COMI (which is subject to a rebuttable presumption that the
company’s registered office is in the same place as its COMI and it should be noted

306


-----

that the COMI for the purposes of the CBIR06 may be different from the COMI of an
entity for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation); and

(ii) “foreign non-main proceedings,” which can be opened in the state in

which the company possesses an “establishment” (defined as any place of operations
where the company carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means
and assets or services).

A foreign representative (defined to be a person or body, including one appointed on an interim basis,
authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the company’s
assets or affairs or to act as a representative of the foreign proceeding) appointed in a foreign main
proceeding or foreign non-main proceeding is entitled to apply to commence a proceeding under British
insolvency law (as such term is used in the CBIR06) if the conditions for commencing such a proceeding
are otherwise met.

A foreign representative may apply to the court for recognition of the foreign proceeding in which the
foreign representative has been appointed. From the time of filing of such an application until the time
the application is decided upon, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative and where
relief is urgently needed to protect the assets of the company or the interests of the creditors, grant relief
of a provisional nature. Such relief may include staying execution against the company’s assets,
entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain
to the foreign representative or another person designated by the court, suspending the right to transfer,
encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of
witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets,
affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to
a British insolvency officeholder (as defined in the CBIR06) under the law of Great Britain, including
any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the IA86.

Upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, commencement or continuation of individual actions
or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities and
execution against the company’s assets are stayed and the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any assets of the company is suspended. Any such stay and suspension does not affect any
right to take any steps to enforce security over the company’s property or of a creditor to set off its
claim against a claim of the company, provided that such right would have been exercisable if the
company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the Insolvency Act 1986.

Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or non-main, where necessary to protect the
assets of the company or the interests of the creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign
representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the
commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the
company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets,
suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing
for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the delivery of information concerning the
company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting the administration or realization of
all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative or another
person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the
granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the law
of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency
Act.

In addition, upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative has standing to make
an application to the court for an order under or in connection with (among others) sections 238, 239,
244, 245 and 423 of the Insolvency Act. See “Antecedent Transaction Laws” below. For such purpose,
certain time periods and notice periods specified in such sections shall be determined by reference to
the date of the opening of the foreign proceeding or the date on which a person has notice of the opening
of the relevant foreign proceedings as provided in the CBIR06. Where such an application is made, then

307

those sections (together with ancillary sections of the Insolvency Act relating thereto) shall apply
whether or not the company is being wound-up or is in administration under British insolvency law.

_Schemes of Arrangement_

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement under
Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano
Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending accession to the latter)
where these apply.

Additionally, where a contract is English law governed, Regulation (EC) 593/2008 on the Law
Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I) (“Rome I”) will continue to apply following the UK’s
exit from the EU. While not historically solely relied on, it is considered possible that the amendments
to such English law governed contracts effected by a scheme of arrangement would be recognized in
EU member states under Rome I.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans under Part
26A of the Companies Act 2006 is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether, like schemes
of arrangement, restructuring plans will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention, or whether they will be recognized in a manner more akin to insolvency proceedings, as
they have been for purposes of the Lugano Convention.

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU, English proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and
guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the
EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of English
insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, crossborder insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of
uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more
problematic for English restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states
and for English office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general
position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules
adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings,
increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of an English
office holder is made in reliance on an English domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much
less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK
was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent
proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of
the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors
are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s
property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed

308


-----

Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims
of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise
with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual set-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are
only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the
mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each
party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable
by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the
creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the
company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

(a) _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured_
assets covers that indebtedness and less any costs of realisation);

(b) _Second ranking: any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver and moratorium debts_
and certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” in circumstances where a company has entered into
a restructuring moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within
12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium;

(c) _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the_
order of priority in which expenses are paid);

(d) _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors:_

(i) ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent
company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii)
wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the
insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place
before or after the date of insolvency; and (iv) bank and building society deposits
eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to
the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally;
and

(ii) secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary
preferential debts. Secondary preferential debts include claims by the revenue in
respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan
repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions
(but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the
company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary
preferential debts rank equally;

(e) _Fifth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._
This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document
that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge.
However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed
Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to
unsecured creditors;

(f) _Sixth ranking:_

(i) firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors. and (to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those

309


-----

debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay
the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use
realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any
distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out
all unsecured creditors;

(ii) secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8%
per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after
the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing
administration;

(iii) thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the
categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all
categories above are fully repaid; and

(g) _Seventh ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any_
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g. an administrator or liquidator) will generally be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security
for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses
out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the
first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property
over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property
is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020,
in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to
unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to
creditors.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security
and/ or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee and/or security.
Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a company, the
administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such
company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event of the onset of its, or a Guarantor’s English law
insolvency proceedings within any of the requisite time periods set forth below, the grant of any security
or Guarantee will not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Transaction at an undervalue_**

Under Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of an English company can apply to the court for
an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an
undervalue. It can only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result
of the transaction, the English company is insolvent on either a cash flow (the company being unable
to pay its debts as they fall due) or on a balance sheet basis (the value of the company’s assets being
less than the value of its liabilities, taking into account prospective and contingent liabilities). The
transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration

310


-----

proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest
or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if it
involves the company making a gift to a person, the company receiving no consideration or the company
receiving consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration
given by such company. However, a court may not make an order to set aside a transaction at an
undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the
purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what
it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary
of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a
presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in
such proceedings.

**_Preference_**

Under the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of an English company can apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a
preference. A transaction can only be a preference if all of the following elements are present, (i) at the
time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction the English company was or became insolvent.
(ii) it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the
company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent
liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction
not been entered into, (iii) the company desired to prefer the relevant party and (iv) the transaction
occurred in the previous six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected
person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) before the onset of insolvency. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was
insolvent and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the
beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. If the court determines that the
transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would
have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the
Notes, the Guarantees and security interests over the Collateral (although there is protection for a third
party who enters into such a transaction in good faith and without notice).

**_Transaction defrauding creditors_**

Under Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was entered into at an undervalue and
was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make,
a claim against a company, or to otherwise prejudice the interests of a person in relation to a claim,
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. This provision may be used with leave of the court, by any person who is a victim
prejudiced, or is capable of being prejudiced, by the transaction and is not therefore limited to
liquidators or administrators or to companies that are in liquidation or administration. There is no time
limit in the Insolvency Act within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does
not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to
what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the
victims of the transaction.

311


-----

**_Extortionate credit transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Obligor up to three years
before the day on which the English Obligor in the period entered into administration or went into
liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing
the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made
(whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it
otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Security over shares_**

The fixed charges over shares granted by certain Guarantors are equitable charges, not legal charges.
An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee
but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable
considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted by a Guarantor
over certain of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an
“Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or following a
crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they
are entitled under their cash pooling arrangements with that Guarantor. As a result, the collateral
constituted by any such bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and setoff rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge.

**_Voidable floating charges_**

Under English insolvency law, if a company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of)
granting the floating charge, then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the
money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt owed by, the
relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest).
The requirement for the company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting
the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the
floating charge is granted to a connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent
of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any
debt owed by, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus
certain interest), whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant. The
transaction can be challenged if the relevant company granted the floating charge within a one year (if
the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two-year (if the beneficiary is a connected person) period
ending with the onset of insolvency. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial
collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject
to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not
need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created
during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt owed by, the relevant
company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether
the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_Challenges to fixed charges_**

Under English insolvency law, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security
interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because
the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other
things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor

312


-----

to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by
the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of
the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any
debt or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights
subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed
by English law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

_Foreign currency_

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their
debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling
at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor
considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Obligors go into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Obligors go into
liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become
entitled.

_Post-petition interest_

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantee in respect
of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be
recoverable by the Noteholders from any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in
the proceedings of the relevant English Obligor and accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to
the date of the commencement of the proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient
realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

_Limitation on enforcement_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction
must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent
that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the
subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some
comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith;
however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate
benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed
transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the
benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may
be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**Denmark**

The below considerations in respect of Danish law only apply to Danish private limited liability
companies (anpartsselskab or ApS) and public limited liability companies (aktieselskab or A/S) such as
the Danish Guarantors (unless otherwise stated).

313


-----

Any insolvency proceedings with respect to a Danish Guarantor would be based on Danish insolvency
laws. The Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast) does not apply to Denmark.

Below is a summary of certain provisions of Danish insolvency laws as they apply to the Danish
Guarantors as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Please note that the summary does not cover
all provisions of applicable Danish insolvency laws nor does it provide all the details of the provisions
that are summarized therein.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Danish Bankruptcy Act (Consolidated Act No. 1600 of 25 December 2022 as amended,
_konkursloven),_ bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a
creditor. A bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court (or an appeal court, as the case may be) to be
satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on a statement of the debtor’s liquidity status, documenting
the debtor’s inability to pay its obligations as they fall due, and that the insolvency is not of a purely
temporary nature. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in
the event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security, see below. In this context,
adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor’s claim
against the debtor. If the security is avoidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been duly
performed (hence, is considered invalid in case of a bankruptcy), the creditor does not have adequate
security.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor
operates its business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition
for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether
and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (a debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court
does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy.

A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if (i) the creditor’s claim is secured by
adequate security in assets belonging to the debtor, (ii) the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate
security in assets of a third party (provided the terms of such third party security restrict the initiation
of bankruptcy proceedings) and/or (iii) the creditor’s claim is not due and a third party offers to provide
adequate and valid security, in each case as further set out in Section 20 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act.
In this context, adequate security means security which provides full coverage for the creditor’s claim
against the debtor. Third party security also includes any guarantee whereby the guarantor assumes
primary liability (selvskyldnerkaution). If the security would be avoidable in bankruptcy or if the
applicable act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor would not have adequate security for
these purposes.

In order to petition for bankruptcy, the creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being
administered in bankruptcy. This does not mean that the creditor is required to have a basis of execution
for its claim (e.g., a judgment in a civil case, a settlement in court or a signed debt instrument or
mortgage) or that the creditor’s claim must be due and payable in all circumstances. However, not all
claims that have not yet become due and payable may form the basis of a petition for bankruptcy.
Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement
being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for
legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for
bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that the creditor will not recover any part of its claim in case the
debtor were to be declared bankrupt. However, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor
has entered into transaction(s) that may be avoided in a bankruptcy, the creditor may have the required
legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have any substantial assets. In that case, the
creditor must be able to substantiate the potentially avoidable transactions with some degree of
certainty.

314


-----

If a creditor has filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor and the conditions for declaring the
debtor bankrupt are not satisfied, the creditor may be liable to pay damages if the debtor has suffered a
loss and/or to pay compensation for damage to the debtor’s reputation.

In connection with a bankruptcy petition, the petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating
to the administration of the bankruptcy estate. In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the
amount up to DKK 40,000, unless the creditor accepts otherwise. If the debtor has filed the petition for
bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the available and unencumbered funds of the bankruptcy
estate or a willing third party.

If bankruptcy proceedings are commenced against a Danish Guarantor, payments by that Danish
Guarantor under its Guarantee may be delayed and may not be made in full. If bankruptcy proceedings
are commenced against a Danish Guarantor, the holders of Notes, after adjudication of the claim by the
Trustee/courts, will receive payments from that Danish Guarantor under its Guarantee (to the extent not
covered by valid security) as a calculated dividend i.e. of the proceeds of any free and unencumbered
(after payments of certain expenses and senior/preferential claims, see below) assets which have been
liquidated as part of the bankruptcy proceedings based on the outstanding amount guaranteed. Often,
the dividend will be disbursed as a lump sum at the time of the conclusions of the bankruptcy estate.

Provisions on avoidance and set-off may adversely affect the enforcement of rights under the
Guarantees. Enforcement of security interests provided by the debtor in the debtor’s assets is restricted
under Danish bankruptcy laws. Those security interests (except for those qualified as “håndpant eller
_anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret” under the Danish Bankruptcy Act) may only be enforced by the_
bankruptcy trustee (kurator). However, mortgagees and execution creditors may demand enforcement
of such security interests six months after the declaration of bankruptcy.

**_Appointment of Bankruptcy Trustee_**

The bankruptcy court appoints one or more trustees to administer the debtor’s bankruptcy estate. In
practice, and provided dividend to unsecured claims is likely to be distributed at some point in time
during the proceedings, the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence
as to the appointment of the trustee as another trustee can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting. The
creditor’s meeting is scheduled to a date after the bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated and the
proceedings haven been opened. The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is
normally the case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules set out in the Danish Bankruptcy Act. The
trustee must not be a related party of the debtor or otherwise dependent on the debtor and there must
not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is
prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. As a further general rule,
the bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s
business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee.

The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate and generally
represents the estate in every respect.

**_Reconstruction Proceedings_**

Reconstruction proceedings are an alternative to bankruptcy proceedings for companies.

Reconstruction proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor company or a
creditor. The petition must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the company
operates its business.

Reconstruction proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor company is “insolvent” as defined
in the Danish Bankruptcy Act. For these purposes, the definition of “insolvent” is the same as for
bankruptcy proceedings - see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the

315


-----

_Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark —Bankruptcy Proceedings”_
above.

If the insolvency criterion is satisfied, the bankruptcy court will appoint a reconstructor and may also
appoint a restructuring accountant (not mandatory) to administer the debtor company. The incumbent
management will continue to operate the company, but any material transactions may not be carried out
without the prior approval of the reconstructor. Payment of creditors may only be done in accordance
with the statutory priority of claims. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark—Priority of Claims”_
below. However, the court may decide that the reconstructor takes over the management as such.

The reconstruction of a company must aim to achieve the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue
of the company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of the
business of the company by transferring the business (in part or in full); (3) a combination of a
compulsory composition and a transfer of business (or part thereof); or (4) other measures, whether
independently or in combination with other aspects of the reconstruction, lead to the debtor’s insolvency
coming to an end. This could include actions such as capital injection. The reconstructor must try to
achieve these objectives in no particular order. If the reconstructor does not realize any of these
objectives - in a way that enables the company to fulfil its duties (likely after a compulsory composition)
as they fall due - the company will automatically enter into bankruptcy proceedings, unless it turns out
that the company is not (or is no longer) insolvent.

**_Preventive restructuring_**

The Danish Bankruptcy Act (Consolidated Act No. 1600 of 25 December 2022, as amended,
_konkursloven) incorporated the EU Directive 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring, taking effect on_
July 17, 2022.

The framework for preventive restructuring enables debtors to respond to early indicators of financial
distress and enables debtors to address their financial challenges at the initial stages of potential
insolvency. This restructuring framework is available if there is a likelihood of insolvency, enabling
debtors to proactively manage financial issues before the actual occurrence of insolvency. This
procedure involves no obligatory appointment of a restructuring administrator or reconstructor.

The preventive restructuring of a company must aim to achieve the following statutory objectives: (1)
the rescue of the company as a going concern by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the
termination of the business of the company by transferring the business (in part or in full); (3) a
combination of a compulsory composition and a transfer of business (or part thereof); or (4) other
measures, whether independently or in combination with other aspects of the restructuring, result in the
debtor’s likelihood of insolvency coming to an end. This could include actions such as capital injection.

The prerequisites for initiating a preventive restructuring procedure are as follows: (1) the debtor
engages in business activities; (2) the debtor submits a formal request; and (3) there is a likelihood of
the debtor’s insolvency.

Submission of a request or initiation of a preventive restructuring procedure does not supersede a
petition for restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings. Nonetheless, the bankruptcy court might opt to
defer the assessment of a reconstruction or bankruptcy petition if the debtor files a request for a
preventive restructuring procedure.

The initiation of a preventive restructuring procedure remains undisclosed until a restructuring proposal
is presented. In other words, the restructuring plan is not made public unless there’s a request for an
automatic stay on the debtor’s assets.

Preventive restructuring can be ended without an automatic transition to bankruptcy.

316

**_Solvent Liquidation_**

The Danish Companies Act (Consolidated Act No. 1451 of 9 November 2022 as amended,
_selskabsloven) provides a regime for liquidation of a company pursuant to which the assets of the_
company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to the company’s creditors and, provided that all
creditors have been paid in full, the company’s shareholders. The decision to liquidate a company is
made by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting that also appoints a liquidator. At the
end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved.

Liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding under Danish law and only companies that are solvent can
be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process that the company
cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must enter into bankruptcy proceedings instead.

**_Certain Avoidance Rules (Clawback Rules)_**

The Danish Bankruptcy Act includes certain avoidance rules (clawback rules) that, subject to certain
conditions, may entitle the bankruptcy estate to avoid the debtor’s transactions completed prior to the
bankruptcy if such transactions have reduced the assets of the bankruptcy estate or otherwise damaged
the bankruptcy estate and/or if the transactions have favored one or more particular creditors without
observing the ranking of the creditors pursuant to the statutory priority of claims.

Transactions damaging the bankruptcy estate include, among other things, repayment of debts, gifts,
renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties.

Transactions favoring particular creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors pursuant to the
statutory priority of claims may include, among other things, payment by unusual means of payment,
payments made in advance of the due date of the debt or payments that have critically deteriorated the
debtor’s ability to pay, in each case provided that the relevant payment did not appear to be ordinary,
or the provision of security for debts already incurred (known as “old debt”).

Below is a summary of (i) the avoidance rule relating to security for old debt (other than security by
way of a registered floating charge (virksomhedspant or fordringspant), in respect of which special rules
apply) and (ii) the general avoidance rule applicable to various transactions. Other avoidance rules are
not summarized herein.

Pursuant to Section 70 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act, any security interest which has not been created
prior to, or simultaneously with, the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, or which is not duly
perfected without undue delay after the incurrence of the underlying secured debt, can be avoided if the
relevant act of perfection is completed later than the date falling three months prior to the “deadline
date” (fristdagen). The deadline date is further defined in Section 1 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act. In
practice, the deadline date will often be the date on which the bankruptcy court received a petition for
reconstruction proceedings or bankruptcy. The hardening period of three months is extended to two
years if the security is provided in favor of a related party of the debtor unless it is proven that the debtor
neither was, nor upon creation of the security became, insolvent.

Pursuant to Section 74 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act (known as the “general clause”
(generalklausulen)), any disposition which unduly favors a creditor to the detriment of the other
creditors, or whereby the debtor’s property is prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the
creditors, or whereby the debtor’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared
void if the debtor was, or by the disposition became, insolvent, and the favored party knew or ought to
have known about the debtor’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the disposition “improper”
(utilbørlig). For these purposes, transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent
business behavior will generally be deemed improper. Improper behavior may be any such behavior
which is contrary to the purpose of insolvency proceedings, for example, where a creditor should have
realized that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to satisfaction of their
claims. This general avoidance rule is not subject to any fixed hardening period, meaning that a

317


-----

transaction may be vulnerable to be set aside even if it was completed long before the deadline date,
provided that the aforementioned conditions are otherwise satisfied.

**_Priority of Claims_**

The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the
debtor’s unsecured creditors, however, creditors who believe they have a claim against the debtor or
the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate
documentation. The trustee registers all claims and examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the
creditor to receive a dividend.

The ranking of creditors is set out in Section 93 - 98 of the Danish Bankruptcy Act which indicates the
order in which claims against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate are settled (excluding claims that are
fully covered by valid security). All higher ranking claims must be satisfied in full before any claims in
the next level will be entitled to a dividend.

The priority of claims is as follows:

- _First, claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings and claims according to affirmed_
agreements;

- _Second, claims in connection with any preceding restructuring or liquidation proceedings and_
related matters;

- _Third, “privilege claims,” mainly employee salary claims, including salary income taxes (relating_
to salary claims being filed) but excluding salary claims from the management board (direktører),
who are not salaried employees (funktionærer);

- _Fourth, claims of suppliers for duty on products that are delivered to the debtor and duty paid for_
the purpose of resale within a period of twelve months prior to the date of the bankruptcy petition
being filed (but only (i) as regards certain specifically listed duties, and (ii) to the extent of the
supplier’s claim for reimbursement of the duties are prepaid);

- _Fifth, other unsecured claims (e.g., all other claims except for deferred claims); and_

- _Sixth, deferred claims (e.g., claims relating to interest accrued after the cut-off date (usually the_
bankruptcy date), certain parts of instalments under certain lease agreements, claims of
compensation that do not reflect actual losses to the beneficiary, fines, promises of gifts and
subordinate loan capital, and related matters).

In the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish kroner using the
relevant currency rate as of the date of the bankruptcy order.

**_Limitation on Enforcement of Guarantees and Security Interests_**

_Financial Assistance_

The Danish Companies Act includes provisions relating to financial assistance which limit the ability
of the Danish Guarantors to provide a guarantee and security in relation to the Notes.

Pursuant to Section 206(1) of the Danish Companies Act, a Danish limited liability company may not,
directly or indirectly, provide any loan, guarantee, security or other financial assistance in relation to
the financing and/or refinancing of a third party’s acquisition of shares in the company or its direct or
indirect parent companies (the “prohibition against financial assistance”). The prohibition against
financial assistance also applies to subsidiaries of the Danish company whether or not incorporated in
Denmark.

318


-----

However, pursuant to Section 206(2) of the Danish Companies Act, the prohibition against financial
assistance does not apply if the financial assistance (i) is granted on the basis of a credit rating of the
persons receiving financial assistance, (ii) has been approved by the company’s general meeting, such
approval to be based on a written report submitted by the company’s central management body
specifying certain matters relating to the financial assistance in question, (iii) does not exceed what is
advisable, having regard to the company’s financial position, (iv) does not exceed the company’s
distributable reserves and (v) is provided on arm’s length terms.

In addition, pursuant to Section 210(1) of the Danish Companies Act, a Danish limited liability
company may not, directly or indirectly, provide any loan, guarantee, security or other financial
assistance in favor of, among others, its shareholders (the “prohibition against upstream shareholder
loans”). The prohibition against upstream shareholder loans does, however, not apply in case of loans,
etc. to direct and indirect parent companies which are limited liability companies incorporated in any
member state of the European Union or the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Australia, Canada,
Chile, Israel, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United
States.

Further, pursuant to Section 210(2) of the Danish Companies Act, the prohibition against upstream
shareholder loans does not apply if the financial assistance (i) does not exceed the company’s
distributable reserves, (ii) is provided on arm’s length terms, (iii) has been approved by the company’s
general meeting or by the company’s central management body on the basis of an authorization granted
by the general meeting, (iv) does not exceed the amount proposed or accepted by the company’s central
management body and (v) occurs after presentation of the company’s first annual report.

_Corporate Benefit_

In order for a Danish company to provide a guarantee or security in relation to another group company’s
debt, it is a general requirement under Danish law that the Danish company obtains an adequate
corporate benefit from such guarantee or security. This is related to the general duty of the board of
directors and the management board of a Danish company to act responsibly (forsvarligt) and to ensure
a proper management of the company’s assets. Further, the board of directors and the management
board must always act in the best interests of the Danish company’s individual interest. When assessing
whether it is in the Danish company’s best interest to guarantee or secure another group company’s
debt, the board of directors and the management board should consider all relevant circumstances,
including (i) the company’s financial position, capital and liquidity resources, (ii) the benefits that the
company will obtain from providing the guarantee or security, (iii) the potential risks related to
providing the guarantee or security, including an assessment of the credit rating of the principal debtor,
and (iv) securing that the arrangement is on arms’ length terms.

If sufficient corporate benefit is not obtained, among others, the guarantee or security may be null and
void. It is not clear under Danish case law to what extent such corporate benefit can be established when
a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company.

_Guarantee Limitations_

To comply with the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions, any
guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever form) granted or purported
to be granted by a Danish Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries will be deemed not to be so granted
and limited if and to the extent required to comply with the provisions on unlawful financial assistance
and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation, as set out in Sections 206-212 of the
Danish Companies Act.

In addition, the Guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors may further be limited to a maximum
amount equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of the Relevant Guarantor (calculated in
accordance with the approved accounting principles) at the time of the granting of the Guarantees, or at
the time payment is requested pursuant to any such Guarantee granted by a Danish Guarantor. The

319


-----

equity limitation applicable to the Guarantees by the Danish Guarantors will apply on an aggregate
basis with respect to any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance (in whatever
form) granted or purported to be granted by a Danish Guarantor in respect of the Notes and the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Danish
Guarantor, your claims may be severely limited or even reduced to zero.

The above-mentioned limitations will apply to the guarantees and security interests granted by the
Danish Guarantors as well as obligations of the Danish Guarantors or other Danish companies under
the Intercreditor Agreement, including, without limitation, obligations and liabilities under or pursuant
to any provisions relating to subordination, turnover, rights of recourse, mandatory prepayments, other
application of proceeds and/or release of liabilities on distressed disposals. Furthermore, certain
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (such as, for example, obligations in respect of
subordination and turnover of claims) will constitute a security interest under Danish law and may not
be valid and/or enforceable to the extent such security interest has not been duly perfected.

Consequently, and pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the obligations of each Danish Guarantor with respect to any guarantee, security and other
obligations in relation to the Notes and the Note Documents will be subject to limitation language,
which may severely limit the value of any guarantee, security and/or other means of financial assistance
granted by such Danish Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral—Financial assistance, corporate benefit and other limitations on the Danish Guarantees_
_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Danish Guarantees” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value_
_of the Danish Collateral.”_

**_Foreign Currency, Statutory Limitation_**

Under the Danish Bankruptcy Act, claims must be converted into DKK at the exchange rate at the day
the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order over the company.

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may become
subject to set-off or counterclaim and a guarantee in favor of a Danish credit institution or a non-Danish
credit institution that provides services into Denmark (either by way of cross border or branch
establishment) may not be enforceable unless a claim has been made under the guarantee within six
months after the due date of the guaranteed obligation.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests_**

_Enforcement Outside Bankruptcy_

The parties to a security agreement can include contractually agreed enforcement procedures and, if
there are no bankruptcy proceedings, the agreed procedures will be binding on the parties. However,
sales of assets may be voidable in a later bankruptcy proceeding if the assets were transferred below
market value.

The agreed enforcement procedures are not binding on third parties such as creditors that have registered
an attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets.

Such third-party attachments and rights can only be cleared through a court administered public auction.

In the absence of specifically agreed enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public
auction in accordance with the Danish Administration of Justice Act (Consolidated Act No. 1655 of
25 December 2022 as amended, retsplejeloven).

Pledges of shares and accounts as well as security assignments of receivables may be enforced without
an execution order. However, at least one week prior notice requesting the debtor to pay the secured
debt must be given to the pledgor in respect of share pledge and account pledge by registered mail

320


-----

unless a sale is necessary to avoid or reduce a loss. The pre-enforcement notice period can be waived
in respect of certain financial collateral arrangements.

_Enforcement Inside Bankruptcy_

Enforcement of security interests is restricted under Danish insolvency laws. Security interests (except
for those qualified as håndpant eller anden tilsvarende sikkerhedsret under the Danish Bankruptcy Act)
may only be enforced by the bankruptcy trustee. However, mortgagees and execution creditors may
demand enforcement of such security interests six months after the declaration of bankruptcy.

**_Perfection of Security Interests_**

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be granted and perfected, inter alia, in favor of the holders
of Notes represented by the Security Agent. Rules have been enacted in the Danish Capital Markets Act
(Consolidated Act No. 41 of 13 January 2023 as amended, _kapitalmarkedsloven) allowing_
representatives to hold security on behalf of holders of Notes and the Security Agent may be appointed
as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets Act as set out in further detail below. There is
not yet any case law relating to this legislation confirming the right of the representative to enforce on
behalf of holders of Notes so there is a risk that enforcement may be delayed.

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be perfected in favor of the Security Agent, however, some
of the Collateral may only be perfected after the occurrence of certain events having occurred or may
not be perfected at all. Absent perfection or registration of the Security Agent with the Danish Financial
Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), the holder of the security interest may not be able to enforce its
rights in the Danish Collateral against third parties, including a bankruptcy administrator and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the same assets. Moreover, if perfection occurs only after the
occurrence of certain events of default, it will entail a hardening period and the transaction may be
voidable (please see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Denmark—Certain Avoidance Rules (Clawback_
_Rules)” above)._

Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date on which the relevant act of
perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time over that same Danish
Collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection of the preexisting security interest, then the security interest created later will have priority.

**_The Security Agent and the Trustee_**

The ability of the Security Agent to hold the relevant security interests over the Danish Collateral on
behalf of holders of Notes pursuant to any security document governed by Danish law as well as the
ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of holders of the Notes may require registration of
the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority.

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to
represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of
the relevant company having granted the Danish Collateral; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security
Agent have and will maintain the capacity to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on
behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of bankruptcy of the relevant company having granted the
Danish Collateral; (iii) whether the security and guarantees can be validly granted in favor of the
Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether the
holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently. As regards the
Notes, a guarantee issued by a Danish Guarantor and any security document expressed to be governed
by Danish law, the above concerns regarding the ability of the Security Agent to hold a guarantee and
the relevant security interests over Collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the ability of the
Trustee to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes can be addressed by registering the
Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with the
rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act. No assurance is given that the Security

321


-----

Agent, the Trustee or the Indenture and other documents meet the eligibility criteria for the Security
Agent and/or the Trustee to be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that such
registration will be obtained or, if obtained, that it will be maintained.

**_Parallel debt_**

There is no established concept of “trust,” “trustee” or “parallel debt” under Danish Law and as such
these concepts may not be recognized or enforced by Danish courts. Danish law does not make any
distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such distinction is made under foreign
law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.

**Switzerland**

**_Limitations on Guarantees and Collateral granted by any Swiss subsidiaries_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (the “Swiss Guarantor”).

The granting of a guarantee, indemnity, security or other benefit as well as any other undertaking
contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver
or set-off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss
Guarantor for the benefit of the Swiss Guarantor’s direct and indirect parent or sister companies
(so-called “Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations”) are subject to certain restrictions and risk being held
invalid or partially invalid under Swiss corporate law. Therefore, the Indenture and/or any other relevant
document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will contain certain limitation language in relation to
Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations of the Swiss Guarantor, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantor to
grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such
restrictions under Swiss law and to protect management from personal liability; such “limitation
language” is standard market practice for, amongst others, indentures, guarantees and security
documents in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock
corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung)._

Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or any security granted by the Swiss Guarantor
apply in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume
Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Upstream/Crossstream Obligations must be within the corporate purposes and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and must
not result in a repayment of the share capital, legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven)
or other non-permitted distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to
the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to
which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will limit the value of any Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations
assumed by the Swiss Guarantor to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely
distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that the Swiss Guarantor is permitted to distribute
to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at such time. Presently, the freely
distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves available for
distribution (minus, without double counting, any freely disposable equity that has to be blocked for
any loans granted by the Swiss Guarantor to a direct or indirect parent company of the Swiss Guarantor
or a direct or indirect subsidiary of any parent company pursuant to applicable Swiss corporate law and
applicable accounting standards) at the time or times at which payment in relation to Upstream/Crossstream Obligations is requested.

In addition, the enforcement of the Swiss Guarantor’s Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may give
rise to Swiss withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double taxation
treaties) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations are
regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss
withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary

322


-----

contained above under “The Offering—Additional Amounts” or in the Indenture or any other
documentation related to the Notes. In addition, any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold
harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with
Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations granted by the Swiss Guarantor would in any case be limited by
the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor. Further, the performance of
Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed,
including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

The Indenture, the purchase agreement and/or any other relevant documents to which the Swiss
Guarantor is a party will expressly provide substantially as follows:

“The obligations under this Agreement of a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of
Switzerland (each a “Swiss Guarantor”) are subject to the following limitations:

(a) If and to the extent a Swiss Guarantor becomes liable under this Agreement or

any other Transaction Document for obligations of its parent company (upstream
security) or its sister companies (cross-stream security) (the “Restricted Obligations”)
and if complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital
(Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich
geschützte Reserven), the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung)
or a (constructive) repayment of statutory capital reserves (Rückzahlung der
_gesetzlichen Kapitalreserve) under Swiss corporate law or would otherwise be_
restricted pursuant to mandatory Swiss law, such Swiss Guarantor’s aggregate liability
for Restricted Obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount of such Swiss
Guarantor’s freely distributable equity (the “Maximum Amount”); provided that such
limitation is required under Swiss law at that time; provided, further, that such
limitation shall not free the Swiss Guarantor from its obligations in excess of the
Maximum Amount, but merely postpone the performance date of those obligations
until such time or times as performance is again permitted under Swiss law. This
Maximum Amount shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and, if and to the
extent required by Swiss law, shall be confirmed by the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor
on the basis of an interim audited balance sheet as of that time.

(b) If so required under applicable law (including tax treaties) at the time it is

required to make a payment under this Agreement, the Swiss Guarantor:

(i) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that such payment or enforcement

proceeds can be used to discharge Restricted Obligations without deduction of
Swiss Withholding Tax by discharging the liability to such tax by notification
pursuant to applicable law rather than payment of the tax;

(ii) if the notification procedure pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above does

not apply, deduct the Swiss Withholding Tax at such rate (currently 35% at the
date of this Agreement) as is in force from time to time from any such payment
or enforcement proceeds used to discharge Restricted Obligations, and pay,
within the time allowed, any such taxes deducted to the Swiss Federal Tax
Administration;

(iii) promptly notify the Initial Purchasers that such notification or, as the

case may be, deduction has been made, and provide the Initial Purchasers with
evidence that such a notification of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration has
been made or, as the case may be, such taxes deducted have been paid to the
Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and

323


-----

(iv) in the case of a deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax, use its reasonable

efforts to ensure that any person, which is entitled to a full or partial refund of
the Swiss Withholding Tax deducted from such payment or enforcement
proceeds, will, as soon as possible after such deduction,

(A) request a refund of the Swiss withholding tax under applicable

law (including tax treaties), and

(B) pay to the Initial Purchasers upon receipt any amount so

refunded.

(c) The Swiss Guarantor shall promptly take and any holding company of the

Swiss Guarantor which is a party to a Finance Document shall procure that the Swiss
Guarantor will promptly cause to be taken any action, including the following:

(i) the passing of any shareholders’ resolutions to approve the payment or

other performance under this Agreement, which may be required as a matter
of Swiss mandatory law in force at that time of the enforcement of the
Agreement in order to allow a prompt use of the payments;

(ii) preparation of up-to-date audited balance sheet of the Swiss

Guarantor;

(iii) conversion of restricted reserves into profits and reserves freely

available for the distribution as dividends (to the extent permitted by
mandatory Swiss law);

(iv) confirmation from the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor that the relevant

amount represents the Maximum Amount; and

(v) to the extent permitted by applicable law, Swiss accounting standards

and the Finance Documents, write-up or realize any of its assets that are shown
in its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the market
value of the assets, in case of realization, however, only if such assets are not
necessary for the Swiss Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).”

**_Overview of Swiss Insolvency Proceedings_**

In the event of the insolvency of the Swiss Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in
Switzerland and Swiss insolvency laws would govern those proceedings. In addition, Swiss debt
enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over
assets located in Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of
the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA, Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung
_und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other_
jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.
Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of a bankruptcy
proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of a Swiss
debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special
enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung)
unless the parties have agreed on a private liquidation. However, if bankruptcy is declared while such
a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the
bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted.

_Summary of Current Insolvency Regulations in Effect in Switzerland_

The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in
force.

Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no
consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of
a group of companies, each entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with
separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities
of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.

Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court _ex officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of_
insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to
Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor
according to Swiss insolvency laws in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped
to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently
to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate insolvency proceedings if it
declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a
debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed
pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a balance
sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent
there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet
shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going
concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that (i)
creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the
over-indebtedness and (ii) there is no serious ground to admit that the over-indebtedness can be cured
in time, but in any event at the latest within ninety days since the interim balance sheets have been
drawn up (Article 725b Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going
concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and over
indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over indebtedness is
based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability
to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption
for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will
typically result in over indebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for bankruptcy
without delay and non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both damage
claims and (in extraordinary cases) sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need
not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of
the debtor’s over indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii)
if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out of court) workout within a relatively short
period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of time is supposed to be.
However, many legal scholars consider such period to be four to six weeks. Finally, the debtor’s auditors
have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for
insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over indebted.

If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of
enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office
(Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located
where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the
writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor
may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection
(Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No
reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the
objection.

325


-----

For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an
application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an
enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional
lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the
event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an
action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist
(Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding
(Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The
competent debt collection office delivers continuation threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) to the
debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case
this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of
the threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of insolvency
proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided
that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In
addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal
against any decision taken by the insolvency court.

The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met,
in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue
insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency
proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed
for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the
insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings
(summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary
insolvency proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Furthermore, in such case,
creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings.

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and
dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The
insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse),
provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may
appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’
committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent
to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). The creditors’ committee has additional
competences.

Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for
those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon
the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a
creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest
bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon
insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as
interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as
the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right
(Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may
generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in
compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors
are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the
insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte).
Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration.

326


-----

Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or,
subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover
(i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used
to satisfy unsecured creditors.

Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Thereafter, all other
claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be
satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain
privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for
the Swiss government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other
creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s
estate (Konkursmasse) after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in
full.

As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may
seek a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court
(Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a
tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium
provisionally (provisorische Stundung) for a maximum period of up to four months or not. With its
decision the court appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case
circumstances would justify it, the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) may withhold a
public announcement of the granting of the provisional moratorium, provided third party interests are
well protected. In such case, (i) the creditors and other authorities will not be notified, (ii) debt collection
proceedings may still be initiated or further pursued (unless challenged by the debtor) and (iii) a
provisional commissioner (provisorischer Sachwalter) must be appointed in all circumstances. In case
it is obvious that there are no chances for a successful reorganization of the company or a composition
agreement (Nachlassvertrag), the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht), acting on its own
motion, opens insolvency proceedings over the debtor. In case the moratorium has been granted
provisionally (provisorische Stundung) and in case during the period of the provisional moratorium a
reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a
time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely
(definitive Stundung) and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed
necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the
commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has
to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition
agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal
Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition
agreements: The ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag), the composition
agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and the composition
agreement in insolvency proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). During a definitive moratorium,
debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the
debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the
secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement
by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim
not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to
bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). However, a debtor
may, subject to consent by the commissioner (Sachwalter), terminate long-term agreements
(Dauerschuldverhältnisse) (other than employment agreements) without notice (even if notice periods
apply under the agreement as such), provided (i) the continuation of the long-term agreement
(Dauerschuldverhältnis) would impede or at least seriously challenge the intended financial recovery
and (ii) provided the counterparty to such long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) is held
harmless (it being understood that the respective claim would be a claim in the composition proceeding
(Nachlassforderung)). Interest payments will be stopped for unsecured claims during the moratorium
(unless otherwise explicitly provided in the composition agreement). The moratorium aims at

327


-----

facilitating a rehabilitation of the debtor under protection of the court or the conclusion of one of the
above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and
confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes
binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the
extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Privileged claims must
be paid in full.

**_Collateral under Swiss Law_**

Generally, any guarantee or security governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms
under Swiss law. Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of art. 111 Swiss Code
of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative.

Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security
agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf
of the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and
set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant
to the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA), in which case the right of
objection pursuant to art. 41 DEBA (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived
in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale
(Freihandverkauf) will be admissible.

In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may
acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security
purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims.
Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale
(Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to
initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA).

After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar
security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by
the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which
provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement
are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess
proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held
on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party
to the security documents relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from
“accessory” security interests and have a secured claim, the security documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent
becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges
governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not
been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid
and enforceable under Swiss law. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral—Security over the collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_
_to the holders of the Notes and the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be_
_restricted by local laws.”_

**_Avoidance actions under Swiss law_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration and certain creditors may, under certain
conditions, avoid transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of, or the payment under, any guarantee
or security or, if a payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee and/or security, require
that the recipients return the amount received to the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). In particular, a

328


-----

transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment
of debt) that is detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency
laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors:

- The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any
consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a
composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung).
Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was
disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant
transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the
burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that
such transaction was at arm’s length.

- Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition
agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the
debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for already existing claims,
provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a
monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any way other than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other
customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance
action is excluded if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the
debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been
over-indebted at that time.

- Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the
intention to disadvantage its creditors, or discriminate some creditors against others or to favor
some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence
must have been known, to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant
transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the
burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that
such intention was not recognizable.

If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason,
the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and/or any security interest and
would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained
by the holders of the Notes under a guarantee and/or security interest that have been avoided would
have to be repaid by the holders of the Notes. The Swiss principles on avoidance may, therefore, limit
the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover payments due on the guarantee and/or any security
interest.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to
be dated on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial
Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes from
the Issuer.

**General**

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the
delivery of officer’s certificates and the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time
be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes
through certain of their affiliates and agents. Any Initial Purchaser that is not a broker-dealer registered
with the SEC will effect offers to sell and sales of the Notes into the United States or to nationals or
residents of the United States only through one or more registered broker-dealers in compliance with
applicable securities laws and regulations. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell the Notes
through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not
licensed or authorized to make direct sales of the Notes.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless
the Initial Purchasers and certain other persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make
in respect thereof. The Issuer and Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that
during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date
hereof, without the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, not to offer, sell,
contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of
our subsidiaries (other than the Notes and the Guarantees).

**Securities Not Being Registered Under the U.S. Securities Act**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons (within the meaning of
Regulation S). Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales
of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers
who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the
commencement of this Offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially
sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in
the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale
is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

330


-----

**United Kingdom**

Each Initial Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors;
and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or
sell any Notes to any retail investor in the European Economic Area or in the United Kingdom. For the
purposes of this provision:

(a) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU
(as amended, “MiFID II”); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the
“Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and

(b) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation
or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer
to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe
any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act to
cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**Liquidity**

The Notes are a new issues of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply to The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes
will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained.

331


-----

Certain Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted
by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes,
and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial
Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits
imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes
will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The transferability of the Notes may be limited under_
_applicable securities laws.”_

**Settlement**

We expect that the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date
specified in the last paragraph on the front cover of this Offering Memorandum, which will
be (on a U.S. T+ convention) or (on a UK/EU T+ convention) business days (as such
term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act). Under rule 15c6-1 under the
U.S. Exchange Act trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days,
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or on one of the next two succeeding business
days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+ U.S. /
T+ U.K., to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or on one of
the next succeeding two business days should consult their advisors.

**Stabilization**

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open
markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf,
may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes
in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers, or
persons acting on their behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or
maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The
Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any
time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.
The Stabilizing Managers agree that they shall act in accordance with Regulation (EU) 596/2014 on
market abuse (market abuse regulation) (and implementing and delegated regulations thereunder) as
regards exemptions for buy-back programs and stabilization of financial instruments.

The Stabilizing Managers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions
and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment
involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial
Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the
Stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the
Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids
permit the Initial Purchaser to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes
originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a Stabilizing transaction or covering transaction
to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may
cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.
These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will undertake any such stabilization
action nor with respect to the direction or magnitude of any stabilization action taken. Such stabilization
action, if commenced, may begin on or after the date of adequate public disclosure of the final terms of
the offer of Notes and may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar

332


-----

days after the date on which the Issuer received the proceeds of the issue and 60 calendar days after the
date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be affected in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise.

**Other activities and relationships**

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, and may
provide in the future, investment banking, financial advisory, mergers and acquisitions and commercial
banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received,
or may receive, customary fees and commissions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates may from time to time also enter into swap and other derivative transactions with the Issuer
and/or its affiliates. In addition, the Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers’ certain customary
fees for their service in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain costs and
expenses incurred.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of
the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship
with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary
risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in the Issuer’s securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby.
Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold,
or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Agreement and Barclays Bank PLC will serve as agent under the New
Revolving Credit Agreement. Under refinancing of the Existing Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit Agreement and the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility, such Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds of this Offering. In addition, Deutsche Bank Trustee
Company Limited will act as Trustee under the Notes and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch acts as
Security Agent.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of_
_any of the Notes and the Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act,
or securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to QIBs in accordance with Rule
144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act,
and therefore the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United States or to,
or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, the Issuer is
offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States, to QIBs; and

- outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. persons” and “United States” with the meanings given
to them in Regulation S.

You, by your acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand that the Notes and Guarantees are being offered for resale in a transaction not

involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act,
that the Notes and Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act and that (A) if in the future you decide to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the
Notes, Notes purchased pursuant to Rule 144A may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise
transferred only (i) in the United States to a person whom you reasonably believe is a QIB in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (ii) to non-U.S. persons outside the United
States in a transaction complying with Regulation S and (iii) in compliance with the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or pursuant to exemption therefrom or in any transaction
not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set out in
paragraph (5) below in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any State of
the United States, and that (B) you will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any
subsequent purchaser of the Notes from you of the resale restrictions referred to in (A) above.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined under the U.S. Securities Act) or acting on our behalf and

you are either:

(a) a QIB, and are aware that any sale of Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and

such acquisition of Notes will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) you are a non-U.S. person and are not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person.

(3) You acknowledge that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the

Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to you with respect to the offer or sale of any Notes,
other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum
has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with
respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person

334


-----

representing the Initial Purchasers make or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy
or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with your
decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which

you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or
any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or
the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and
subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any
other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing

the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by the acceptance thereof will be deemed to
agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes only (i) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any
subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under
the U.S. Securities Act, an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act

any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and the Trustee’s rights prior

the Indenture is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee.

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note sold pursuant to Rule 144A will contain a legend

substantially to the following effect:

BY REGULATION S.

(7) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any

restrictions on the transfer of such Notes.

(8) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of

the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(9) You acknowledge that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy

of your acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agree that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by
your purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, you shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers.
If you are acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you
represent that you have sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and
that you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements
on behalf of each such investor account.

(10) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by

the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of
the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other
material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under
“Plan of Distribution.”

within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act, the relevant Issuer will, during any
period in which it is neither subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, nor exempt from the reporting requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, make available to any holder or beneficial owner of the relevant Note, or to any
prospective purchaser of such a Note designated by such holder or beneficial owner, the information
specified in, and meeting the requirements of, Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act upon the
written request of any such holder or beneficial owner. Any such request in respect of the Notes, should

340


-----

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The
Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Denmark and Switzerland. The
security documents relating to the Collateral are governed by the laws of England and Wales, Denmark
or Switzerland. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New York
law. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales. All of the directors
and executive officers of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States.
Substantially all of the assets of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and their respective directors and
executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a
U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws, may
not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will
appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New
York courts, in each case, in connection with any suit, action or proceedings in relation to the Notes,
the Guarantees, the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws or other laws, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process on the Issuer or on such other persons as mentioned above within
the United States in any action, including actions and judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. If a judgment is obtained
in a U.S. court against the Issuer, any Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive
officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or
individual has assets. While the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is
summarized in part below for England and Denmark, you should consult with your own advisors in any
relevant jurisdictions to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**England**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or directly enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England,
proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action,
the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

- the U.S. court being recognized by the English court as having had, at the time when proceedings
were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international
law;

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and establishing a debt or being for a definite sum of
money;

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature
or in respect of a penalty or fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English
court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law;

- the U.S. judgment not contravening public policy or statute in England and Wales;

341


-----

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and is not being otherwise in breach
of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
or substantial justice;

- the U.S. judgment is (i) not a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or
another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or (ii) conflicts with an earlier
judgment of such court;

- the U.S. judgment is given in proceedings brought in breach of an agreement for the settlement of
disputes; or

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an
English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced
in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
Furthermore, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the
judgment debtor is or becomes subject to an insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor
has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

**Denmark**

The United States and Denmark currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgement rendered by
a U.S. federal, or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable
in Denmark.

A final judgement properly obtained in a U.S. federal, or state court would not be recognized nor
enforced by the Danish courts without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated.
In connection with any such re-examination, such judgement would generally be accepted as material
evidence, but the parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents
of the relevant foreign law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead.

Further, certain remedies available under U.S. federal or state law may not be allowed in Danish courts,
i.e., if they are contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other, punitive damages. The Danish
courts may award damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses.
Similarly, procedural remedies, including specific rules on the taking of evidence such as the rules on
“discovery” in the U.S., may not be available in legal proceedings before Danish courts.

Similarly to the above, there can be no certainty that the Danish courts will enforce court judgements
or orders obtained in the United States against any of the directors, officers, or other executives of a
Danish Guarantor.

Foreign arbitral awards against a Danish Guarantor (or against any of its directors, officers, or other
executives) may be enforced in Denmark under the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 2005 Danish Arbitration Act.

**Switzerland**

We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments
in Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a

342


-----

Swiss court. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be
enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be
recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceeding set forth in particular by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz
_über das internationale Privatrecht), the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische_
_Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über_
_Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the_
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set
out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das
_internationale Privatrecht), which include amongst others:_

- The U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective;

- The judgment being final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law, or no ordinary legal
remedy being available against such judgment;

- The defendant having had the chance to defend itself against any unduly or untimely served
complaint except for a defendant that unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before
the respective court;

- The original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of
Swiss civil procedure law, in particular the right to be heard;

- The matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a
matter (Verfahren) pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter was pending before
a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and

- The enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss
public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however,
assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is
uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an
appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 of the Swiss
Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht). In
addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts
as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court
may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Furthermore, it is not certain that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in
Switzerland, would apply U.S. federal or state laws. The applicable law will be determined in particular
in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das
_internationale Privatrecht), which may limit the right of the parties to choose the applicable law. As an_
example, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties to an agreement, a court of Switzerland
or other authority will not apply a provisions of foreign law if and to the extent that this would, in the
court’s or authority’s view, lead to a result violating Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public)
or similar general principles. Moreover, a court of Switzerland or other authority will apply,
notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties, any provisions of Swiss law (and, subject to further
conditions, of another foreign law) which in the court’s or authority’s view imperatively demand
application in view of their specific purpose (lois d’application immédiate).

343


-----

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. For
example, with respect to the production of evidence, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several
other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to
the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and
the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Swiss law.

**Other jurisdictions**

There are risks, including risks similar to those described above, in relation to enforcing judgments
from a U.S. federal or state court in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that such
risks do not and will not exist in other jurisdictions, including those in which the assets of some or all
of our subsidiaries that may guarantee the Notes in the future are located.

# Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC

## Report on the audit of the financial statements

###### Opinion

In our opinion:

- Pinnacle Bidco PLC’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give
a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the
group’s loss and the group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework”, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual report and consolidated financial statements (the
“Annual Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated and Company statements of financial position as at
31 December 2022; the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement and
the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the
consolidated and company financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Independence

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

###### Our audit approach

 Overview

Audit scope

- Our significant components were determined in relation to their contribution to the group's financial result or the
group's financial position

- The group audit consisted of full scope audits over four components comprising; two financially significant
components, being Pure Gym Limited (UK) and Fitness World A/S (Denmark), and two other significant components,
being Pure Gym AG (Switzerland) due to the prior year revenue misstatement identified by management (see further
detail in the Key audit matters section below), and Pinnacle Bidco PLC (UK) due to the entity holding the group’s
listed debt. Audit procedures were also performed over Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses in Pinnacle Europe
Holdings Limited (UK), and over Cash, Cost of Sales and Inventory in Functional Supply A/S (Denmark).

- In addition, centrally managed functions, including the group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the

Key audit matters

- Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment (group)

- Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland (group)

- Risk of material misstatement in revenue recognition in Switzerland (group)

- Risk of incorrect classification of current lease liabilities in the UK (group)

- Risk of impairment of investments in subsidiaries and amounts due from group undertakings (company)

Materiality

- Overall group materiality: £4,600,000 (2021: £3,000,000) based on 2.5% of group EBITDA (2021: 1% of group
revenue).

- Overall company materiality: £2,500,000 (2021: £1,500,000) based on 1% of total assets, capped below group
materiality as part of our component materiality allocations.

- Performance materiality: £2,920,000 (2021: £1,875,000) (group) and £1,875,000 (2021: £1,125,000) (company).

###### The scope of our audit

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

###### Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on:
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The risk of material misstatement in revenue recognition in Switzerland (group) and the risk of incorrect classification
of current lease liabilities in the UK (group) are new key audit matters this year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below
are consistent with last year.

**Key audit matter** **How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

_Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and_
_equipment (group)_

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|


The Group holds a significant amount of right-of-use (‘ROU’)
assets and other property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’) on the
balance sheet, amounting to a net book value of £681.0m at the
year end (2021: £676.0m). The group's recovery from the impact
of the Covid-19 pandemic on the gym sector, as well as the
macroeconomic situation in the second half of 2022 which caused
government bond yields to rise, has meant that there is the
possibility of impairment trigger events and therefore the
impairment of ROU assets and other PPE remains a significant
risk. Each gym is considered an individual cash generating unit
(‘CGU’) and assessed individually for evidence of any impairment
triggers, principally by reference to the performance of the
individual gyms. The identification of impairment triggers requires
management to exercise judgement. For those gyms where an
impairment assessment is required, management have prepared
discounted cash flows to support the carrying value of the
associated assets. The discounted cash flows include a number
of estimates, with the key assumptions being: the forecasted cash
flows of the individual gym; the long term growth rate used within
the forecasts; and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.
Management has recognised an impairment charge in relation to
ROU assets and PPE of £21.4m during the year (2021: £10.5m).
See the Critical accounting estimates and judgements policies



- We reviewed the forecast financial performance
of the gyms within each territory and held
discussions with management to understand their
assessment of potential impairment indicators;

- We understood management's process for
budgeting and forecasting and obtained
management's impairment model for each gym
which had impairment triggers identified;

- We tested the mathematical accuracy of the
impairment model and agreed the carrying value of
non current assets being assessed for impairment
to the underlying accounting records;

- We assessed the historical accuracy of
management’s forecasts by reviewing actual
results to previous forecasts taking account of the
significant impact Covid-19 has had on
performance in recent years;

- We assessed the cash flow projections used in
the impairment model in comparison to the trading
environment and industry reports, and our
understanding of performance from other aspects

Based on the procedures performed and our challenge of management an additional material impairment expense has been recognised against the carrying value of the Group’s ROU assets or PPE at year end.|
|---|---|
|Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland (group) The Group holds £783.3m of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet at the year end (2021: £804.9m). Within these balances are amounts relating specifically to the Fitness World Group businesses in Denmark and Switzerland acquired in 2020 (additions on acquisition in 2020 of £347m). Management is required to perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and test for impairment of other intangible assets where there are indicators of impairment. Impairment assessments of this nature involve subjective judgements and estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. We focused specifically on the Denmark and Switzerland groups of CGUs due to the relatively lower degree of impairment headroom compared to the UK and the respective trading results of these components. Management prepared discounted cash flows for each CGU to support the carrying value of the associated assets. The discounted cash flows include a number of estimates, with the key assumptions being: the forecasted cash flows of the territory; the long term growth rate used within the forecasts; and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Management recognised an impairment charge in relation to Goodwill and other intangible assets of £23.7m during the year (2021: £5.8m). See the Critical accounting estimates and judgements policies section within the Group financial statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates and Note 12 within the Group financial statements for details of the Intangible assets balances.|• We reviewed the forecast financial performance of the CGUs and held discussions with management to understand their assessment of potential impairment; • We understood management's process for budgeting and forecasting and obtained management's impairment model for each group of CGUs; • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of assets being assessed for impairment to the underlying accounting records; • We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts by reviewing actual results to previous forecasts taking account of the significant impact Covid-19 has had on performance in recent years; • We assessed the cash flow projections used in the impairment model in comparison to the trading environment and industry reports, and our understanding of performance from other aspects of our audit, including our consideration of the impact of climate change on the business; • We utilised our internal valuation experts to assess the discount rates and long term growth rates used within the impairment models for each CGU; • We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to quantify the downside changes needed to trigger an impairment, or to increase the impairment charges recognised. • We also assessed the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the key assumptions. Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any material adjustments to the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland at year end, and concluded management's impairment assessment was reasonable.|


_Risk of material misstatement in revenue recognition in_
_Switzerland (group)_

The group recognised revenue from its Switzerland operations of
£29.4m for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £18.6m). In
2022, management identified an error in the way in which
revenue was being calculated in the Swiss operating segment,
impacting 2021 and previous financial years. The error resulted in

Over the post-acquisition period, an accumulated error was identified of which £5.3m was reported in the financial year ended 31 December 2021. As the prior year misstatement is material we deemed it appropriate to bring the Swiss trading subsidiary into full scope for group reporting purposes on a risk basis. See Note 30 within the Group financial statements for disclosure of the correction of prior period error.|• We instructed our component auditor to test the corrected revenue and associated balance sheet accounts to underlying supporting information, including member data and cash receipts; • We challenged management on the potential impact of the misstatement identified on prior year Goodwill and Intangible asset and PPE and ROU asset impairment assessments relating to Switzerland; • We assessed whether there could be a similar material misstatement in the UK or Denmark. Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any further material adjustments as a result of the restatement made in the Group financial statements.|

###### How we tailored the audit scope

Pinnacle Bidco


-----

The group comprises 27 components of which 4 are main trading entities and 23 are holding companies. We scoped
the audit with five significant components. This included the two largest trading entities, Pure Gym Limited (UK) and
Fitness World A/S (Denmark), which contribute the majority of the trading results. We included in our scope Pinnacle
Bidco PLC which has issued the group’s external borrowings, and has the associated interest expense. Pure Gym AG
(Switzerland) has been fully scoped in this year due to a prior year adjustment identified in revenue recognition. In
addition, audit procedures were also performed over Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses in Pinnacle Europe Holdings
Limited (UK), over Cash, Cost of Sales and Inventory in Functional Supply A/S (Denmark). Finally, centrally managed
functions, including the group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the group engagement team. In
establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us,
as the group engagement team, or component auditors from the PwC network operating under our instruction. Where
work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in this work to
be able to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained.

###### The impact of climate risk on our audit

As part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate risk
on the group’s and company’s financial statements, and we remained alert when performing our audit procedures for
any indicators of the impact of climate risk. Our procedures did not identify any material impact as a result of climate
risk on the group’s and company’s financial statements.

###### Materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

**Financial statements - group** **Financial statements - company**

_Overall_ £4,600,000 (2021: £3,000,000). £2,500,000 (2021: £1,500,000).
_materiality_

_How we_ 2.5% of group EBITDA (2021: 1% of group revenue) 1% of total assets, capped below

component materiality allocations

_Rationale for_ EBITDA is considered to be an appropriate benchmark as this We believe that total assets is the
_benchmark_ is considered to be the key performance indicator (KPI) of the primary measure used by the
_applied_ Group after recovering from the impact of the Covid-19 shareholders in assessing the

pandemic. Revenue as a benchmark was considered the performance of the entity, and is a
appropriate benchmark in the prior year given the significant generally accepted auditing
impact of enforced gym closures during the Covid-19 benchmark due to it being a holding
pandemic on EBITDA performance. company.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was from £1,750,000 to £4,100,000. Certain
components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected
and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining
the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and
disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 62.5% (2021: 62.5%) of overall
materiality, amounting to £2,920,000 (2021: £1,875,000) for the group financial statements and £1,875,000 (2021:
£1,125,000) for the company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk
assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount in the middle of our
normal range was appropriate.

|Col1|Financial statements - group|Financial statements - company|
|---|---|---|
|Overall materiality|£4,600,000 (2021: £3,000,000).|£2,500,000 (2021: £1,500,000).|

We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit
above £230,000 (group audit) (2021: £150,000) and £125,000 (company audit) (2021: £75,000) as well as
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

###### Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting included:

- Obtaining the Directors' group level going concern assessment paper and cash flow forecasts in the going concern
review period. We tested the cash flow forecasts for mathematical accuracy;

- Performing look back procedures to assess management’s forecasting accuracy;

- Evaluating the forecasts against current trading conditions and assessing the reasonableness of the key
assumptions driving the cash flows;

- Vouched the £300m investment in the group from an equity investor to cash receipt in the bank statements and
reviewed the forecasts and projections in light of this investment.

- Assessing the group's banking facilities, associated banking covenant requirements in the going concern
assessment period and banking covenant waivers received in the prior year;

- Challenging management on their severe but plausible downside scenarios, and assessing the resilience of the
business to withstand these.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the
group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

###### Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency
or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement
of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain
opinions and matters as described below.

###### Strategic report and Directors' report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and
Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2022 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared


-----

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

###### Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

 Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the financial statements, the directors
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

###### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to health and safety legislation, employment law, and data protection legislation, and we
considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also
considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as tax legislation and
the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the
financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to
posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or EBITDA, and management bias in accounting estimates,
specifically those relating to the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, right of use assets, property, plant and
equipment, investments in subsidiaries, and amounts owed by group undertakings. The group engagement team shared
this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response
to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors
included:

- discussions with management including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws
and regulation and fraud;

- assessment of compliance with local laws and regulations and relevant tax legislation by each component audit team
and the group audit team, as applicable;

- identifying and testing journal entries using a risk-based targeting approach for unexpected account combinations,
specifically those to increase revenue, or reclassify items above or below the EBITDA line to manipulate the financial
performance of the business;

- obtaining management's impairment models to assess the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, right of use
assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in subsidiaries and amounts owed by group undertakings and
challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management by agreeing to supporting information and
evidence; and

- reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation, where appropriate, to assess
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.


-----

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data
auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing
complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics.
In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample
is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

###### Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

## Other required reporting

###### Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

###### 1 General information

The principal activity of the Group during the year was the provision of facilities for physical fitness and
is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. Pinnacle Bidco PLC (“the Company”) is limited by
shares and is registered, incorporated and domiciled in England, United Kingdom. The address of the
Company’s registered office is C/O Pure Gym Limited, Town Centre House, Merrion Centre, Leeds,
West Yorkshire, LS2 8LY, United Kingdom.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance
with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. On 31 December
2020, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union at that
date was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, with future
changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Group transitioned to UKadopted International Accounting Standards in its consolidated financial statements on 1 January
2021. This change constitutes a change in accounting framework. However, there is no impact on
recognition, measurement or disclosure in the period reported as a result of the change in framework.

The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified
for the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The
Group financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling (“£m”) except when otherwise
indicated. Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all financial years presented.

The preparation of the Group financial statements in conformity with UK-IFRS requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based
on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ
from those estimates.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2022. The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated
for the period from the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for using the
acquisition method. Uniform accounting policies are applied throughout the Group.

**Foreign currency translation**

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (‘the functional
currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions, from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies,
and from borrowings denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates, are presented in
the statement of profit or loss, within finance costs.

Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign controlled entity are recognised in other
comprehensive income, and accumulated in the translation reserve within equity. The cumulative
amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker, identified as the Executive Management Team of the Group. The Executive
Management Team primarily consider the business from a geographical perspective, by country of
operation. The Group’s operations consist solely of the provision of high quality health and fitness
facilities and associated services and consequently, it is not necessary to segregate operating
segments by service or product. The Executive Management Team use the measures of Revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA as key performance indicators in assessing the performance of the operating
segments. A definition of Adjusted EBITDA is included in note 4.

The Group’s material reportable segments are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland. The
results from operations in all other countries in which the Group operates are included in “All other
segments”, as they are deemed to be individually immaterial.

**Going Concern**

The Directors have carefully evaluated the Going Concern basis of the Group. In doing so, they have
taken account of the Group’s ongoing recovery from COVID-19 and the impact of the inflationary
environment and cost-of-living pressures affecting the countries in which the Group operates at the
time of signing these financial statements.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements, capex and funding of new sites through
its cash reserves and credit facilities, being an RCF facility of £145 million which includes an overdraft
of £10 million.

As at 25 April 2023, the date of signing the financial statements, the Group’s forecasts and projections
(to 30 April 2024) taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and potential
future lockdowns, showed that the Group should be able to operate within its existing facilities.

This assessment included consideration of severe but plausible downside scenarios including a
threefold increase in utility prices, and a 10% inflationary uplift in other costs.

The Group had cash reserves at 31 December 2022 of £205 million, as well as a further £30 million
cash in the parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited. Combining these with the available RCF facility
gives a total liquidity position of £380 million at 31 December 2022. Under the severe but plausible
downside scenarios modelled, the Group would maintain a minimum liquidity of £210 million for the
entire forecast period to April 2024.

Based on these forecasts, and with no leverage or cash flow covenants until at least August 2024, the
Directors have concluded that the Group has adequate resources to continue to remain a going
concern for the foreseeable future and have therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing
its financial statements.

**Revenue**

Revenue primarily represents sales of services provided in the period and non refundable joining fees
received during the period, exclusive of value added tax. Member income includes membership
subscriptions and joining fee income. Membership subscriptions are received in advance of the period
to which they relate and are recognised as contract liabilities. The performance obligation attached to
membership subscriptions is satisfied over time, on a straight line basis over the membership period
as this best represents the timing of services provided.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Where there are specific performance obligations attached to joining fees, then the income related to
this is recognised in the period in which membership commences since the performance obligation
attached to that income is satisfied in that period. Where there are no specific performance obligations
attached to joining fees, these are recognised over time, on a straight line basis over the expected
duration of the membership.

Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time. Income from gift cards sold for use
in the purchase of consumable items is initially deferred and recognised as revenue at the point in time
when the gift card is utilised, or when it is determined that the likelihood of the gift card being utilised
becomes remote (whichever is sooner). The likelihood of a gift card being utilised at a certain point in
time is determined by reference to historical evidence on the timing of the use of gift cards.

Other revenue includes revenue from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over
which the personal trainer is operating, and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training
services vouchers which are both recognised at a point in time.

**Other Income**

Other income represents income arising outside of the Group’s ordinary activities, being the running
of gyms, provision of gym-related services, and the sale of vending and consumable items. It includes
income from insurance claims.

**Cost of sales**

Cost of sales represents the cost arising in connection with the generation of revenue from the “vending
and consumables income” and “other revenue” revenue streams, including the cost of inventories sold.

**Intangible assets**
**(a) Goodwill**
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to
each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the
Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill is not amortised, instead impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU,
or group of CGUs, containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher
of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as
an expense and is not subsequently reversed.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**_(b) Intangible assets acquired in business combinations_**
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the
date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement
utilising valuation expertise and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental
cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore,
management must estimate the expected useful life of intangible assets and charge amortisation on
these assets accordingly, the value of which is shown within administrative expenses. The useful life
estimated for assets acquired in business combinations varies based on the characteristics of the
particular asset, and are set out in note 12. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
include customer relationships and brands. For the purpose of impairment testing, intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

**(c) Software**
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets where the following
criteria are met:

- It is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- Management intends to complete the software and use it in the course of business

- There is an ability to use the software

- It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the
software are available, and

- The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Until the software is ready for use, capitalised development costs are presented within “Development
Projects in Progress” and are not amortised. Once the software is ready for use, the capitalised costs
are transferred into the “Software” category and amortised straight line over a period of 3 to 5 years.

**Inventories**

Inventories primarily relate to goods for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Inventories are valued on a
first in, first out basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost, including those costs that were directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition. Any capital contribution by a landlord towards
leasehold fitting out works is deducted from the cost of property, plant and equipment within that
leasehold. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less provisions for
depreciation and impairment.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset (less residual value) over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Right-of-use assets Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold costs Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold improvements Straight line over the shorter of 3-15 years or remaining lease life,
except where the Group has control over retaining a lease beyond
its contractual term. Where this is the case, the depreciation period
is the shorter of 3-15 years or the expected remaining period to
retain the lease

Fixtures and fittings Straight line over 3-10 years

IT equipment Straight line over 3-5 years

Assets which are not ready for use are presented within “Assets under construction” and are not
depreciated. Once the asset is ready for use, the capitalised costs are transferred into the appropriate
category within property, plant and equipment.

Residual values are calculated where appropriate based on agreed buyback terms with suppliers.

**Leases as a lessee**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

The Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred.

The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right of use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
More information on the determination of the lease term is included in note 3.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate using the interest rates from recent third party
funding, with adjustments appropriate for the lease term and security to make it specific to a particular
lease.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

  - fixed payments, including in substance fixed payments; and

  - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index
or rate as at the commencement date.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if the Group
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if
there is a revised in substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying
amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss as ‘profit on lease modifications’ if the
carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right of use assets as part of ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities
as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.

A small number of property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated
from a particular gym. For certain gyms, up to 100% of lease payments are on the basis of variable
payment terms with a range of percentages as a proportion of sales. Variable lease payments that
depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those
payments occurs.

**Leases as a lessor**

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance
lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the
case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment,
the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic
life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right- of-use
asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a shortterm lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease
as an operating lease.

**Financial instruments**

**_Financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises financial liabilities at fair value where applicable (net of any transaction
costs) and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where the Group has borrowings, transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest method
over the life of the loan. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations
are discharged, cancelled, or expire. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised as finance
income or finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge risks associated with interest rate movements or foreign
exchange. The Group initially recognises such instruments at fair value where applicable and
subsequently remeasures at each balance sheet date.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**_Financial assets_**

The Group classifies its financial assets as ‘those to be measured at amortised cost’ or ‘those to be
measured subsequently at fair value’. At initial recognition, the Group measures its financial assets at
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial
assets carried at FVPL are expensed in the profit or loss.

**_Financial assets (continued)_**

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other
receivables. These assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets
in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise,
on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.

**Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Impairment of financial assets**

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all financial assets. To measure the expected credit losses,
financial assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before
31 December and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The
historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready for use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or
depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This is deemed to occur when the cash generating unit
(“CGU”) to which the asset belongs is performing below expectation. For property, plant and equipment
this is generally deemed to be when the CGU to which it belongs is loss making more than three years
after opening.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash generating units). The Group’s CGUs
consist of individual gyms.

Goodwill, customer relationships and brands are assessed at the group of CGUs level, where each
gym represents a CGU. No group of CGUs is at a level higher than an operating segment.

Prior impairments of non financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at
each reporting date.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where it is not possible to isolate cash flows
generated by a specific item of property, plant and equipment, impairment is tested at the CGU level,
representing a single gym. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

On certain of its leases, the Group is required to restore leased premises to their original condition at
the end of the respective lease term. Where it is deemed probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the restoration obligation, a provision is recognised for the present value of the
estimated expenditure required to remove leasehold improvements. The associated cost is capitalised
as part of the leasehold improvements and amortised over the shorter of the lease term or the useful
life of the assets. The estimates used in determining probability of an outflow of resources are
addressed in note 3.

**Pension obligations**

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an
employee benefit expense when they are due.

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method.

The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on
high quality corporate bonds in the currency the benefits are paid. An extrapolation of current market
rates along the yield curve takes place to determine the necessary discount rates for the valuation of
the pension liabilities.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the
statement of profit or loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income.
They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service costs.

**Government grants**

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and recognised in the
same line item in the statement of comprehensive income.

**Taxation**

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so
to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of
income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature and
amount. Examples of items included within exceptional items are restructuring and transformational
costs, and costs relating to acquisitions or certain expansion projects. Impairments of intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment are not included within exceptional items, but are presented
separately in note 6. Management consider, on a case by case basis, whether costs are exceptional
based on the specific circumstances.

**New and amended standards**

No new or amended accounting standards or interpretations had an impact on the financial statements
in the current year, and no material impact on the financial statements is expected from known future
new or amended accounting standards.

Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have
been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2022 reporting periods and have not been
early adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments or interpretations are not expected to
have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods an on foreseeable future
transactions.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and judgements
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Estimates**

_Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based
on the recoverable amount of its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). The Group also assesses whether
any events have occurred which would trigger an impairment review of non-financial assets with finite
useful lives such as intangible assets other than goodwill and property, plant and equipment.

Where this is the case, the recoverable amount of the CGU being assessed is initially determined
based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows
and the determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash
flows.

Management also consider whether reasonably possible changes in key assumptions may cause an
impairment of the non-financial assets. A summary of the key assumptions used, and the possibility of
impairment, should reasonably possible changes in those key assumptions occur, is included in note
12.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

_Provisions for leasehold dilapidations_

Provisions are made for dilapidations or restoration of leasehold improvements in leased properties.
Management make estimates of the amount and timing of future payments in relation to the restoration
of leased properties based on contractual obligations, historic experience and the views of experts.
Where it is assessed that the likelihood of an outflow of resources to settle a restoration obligation on
leased premises is probable, a provision is made for the expected future outflow, discounted to present
value using a discount rate of between 1% and 4% (2021: 1% and 2%) to reflect the time value of
money. The discount rate is based on risk-free costs of borrowing in the relevant jurisdictions.

As at 31 December 2022, management have determined that a provision is required for 223 out of its
546 leased premises. Details of the provision recorded are included in note 19. If the future cost of
restoration for a site where a provision has been recorded were to increase by 10%, the provision at
31 December 2022 would increase by £1.8m.

_Incremental borrowing rate for discounting of lease liabilities_

The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments in the calculation of lease
liabilities. The use of this method requires estimates of interest rates which would be available to the
Group if it were to borrow funds, over a similar term and with a similar security, necessary to obtain an
asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. Management utilise
internal and external information to determine an appropriate rate. This includes evidence arising from
the Group’s recent third-party borrowings, publicly available borrowing rates for companies with similar
characteristics to the Group, and risk-free interest rates applicable in the relevant geographies in which
the Group operates. IBRs applied to leases across the Group range from 5% to 10% (2021: 5% to
10%). Details of the lease liabilities recognised are included in note 17.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_

The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there
will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be
deducted.

Management makes an estimate of the future taxable profits of the Group and compares this to the
available losses, taking into account applicable tax laws in the relevant geographies. In making the
estimate, management-approved budgets for a 5 year period after the end of the reporting period are
used. It is then assumed that no further growth in profits will occur beyond this point, in the absence
of detailed budgets for that period. Estimation uncertainty increases in later years of the forecast period
due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future profits.

At 31 December 2022, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £52.5m (2021: £23.5m) on
carried forward losses of £217.2m (£97.7m). The carried forward losses recognised as an asset are
expected to be fully utilised by 2033. However, if taxable profits were to fall in the period beyond the 5
year forecast, the time taken to utilise carried forward losses would increase. Of the deferred tax asset
on losses, £1.4m is expected to be utilised within 12 months. Further detail of the tax charge and
deferred tax asset are set out in note 11.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

**Judgements**

_Lease terms on leased properties_

The Group recognises leased properties in accordance with IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The lease term is
determined as the non-cancellable period of each lease, together with periods covered by an option
to extend the lease if management are reasonably certain to exercise that option. Certain of the
Group’s leases include clauses which allow the Group to unilaterally extend the lease on a rolling
basis. Management exercise significant judgement in determining the period over which they are
reasonably certain that they will continue to extend such leases. In making this assessment on a leaseby-lease basis, management consider the following factors:

  - The prevailing market conditions relative to the contractual lease terms

  - Significant leasehold improvements undertaken that are expected to have a significant
economic benefit for the Group

  - Costs relating to the termination of the lease

  - The importance of the gym to the Group’s operations; and

  - The Group’s past practice on extending leases beyond their contractual terms.

In the year ended 31 December 2022, management made changes to their estimate of reasonably
certain lease terms for the Group’s leases based on the latest market conditions and management’s
expectations. This resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of lease liabilities of £48.7m, a
reduction in the carrying amount of right of use assets of £47.2m and a profit on lease modifications
of £1.5m.

_Classification of exceptional administrative expenses_

The Group presents exceptional administrative expenses separately within the statement of
comprehensive income. The Group exercises judgement in determining which expenses are
categorised as exceptional bearing in mind the size and nature of the expenses and associated
projects.

###### 4 Operating segments

The group’s material reportable segments in the current period are the United Kingdom, Denmark and
Switzerland. The results from operations in all other countries in which the Group operates are included

Adjusted EBITDA (after rent deferments) 39.9 (5.5) (4.1) (0.3) 30.0

All operating segments derive revenue from all of the services and products included within note 5. All
revenue included in the table above derives from external customers.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure derived by adjusting operating profit for depreciation,
amortisation, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease
modifications, impairment of property, plant and equipment, exceptional costs, share based payment
charges, pre-opening costs, other adjustments and the cash rent adjustment. The cash rent
adjustment includes an add back of any property rent related expenses charged in the statement of
comprehensive income (including COVID-related grant income on properties and rent-free
concessions agreed) and a deduction of contractual property rent payments due in the period (whether
or not paid in cash in the period). Adjusted EBITDA is stated both before and after rent deferments
which relate to property rent deferments agreed with landlords due to COVID-19 gym closures.

The Adjusted EBITDA KPI is typically used within the industry as it is more effective than operating
profit in representing the performance of the business and, as such, is a key focus of our stakeholders,
including our investors, our bondholders and our banking partners.

See note 30 for details of the restatement to the 2021 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

###### 5 Revenue

Revenue is analysed by service or product as follows:

Member income **424.3** 268.4

Vending and consumables income **22.3** 15.9

Other revenue **29.8** 18.1

**476.4** 302.4

The Group’s gyms have been fully open during 2022. As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, the
Group was forced to close some or all of its gyms across the estate from the start of 2021 until May
2021, and this caused a significant reduction in revenue for the Group during the closure and recovery
periods.

For members in the United Kingdom and Denmark, during the closure periods, all memberships were
automatically frozen meaning that no payments for gym subscriptions were taken from members
during this time.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 5 Revenue (continued)

Prior to and during the closure periods, our Swiss business operated a subscription model. Under this
model, amounts paid by members in advance for any closure period were deferred such that revenue
for gym subscriptions was only recognised when gyms were open. Where membership renewals fell
within the closure period, payment was taken from members as usual, but an extended membership
term provided to cover the closure periods.

The majority of member income is recognised over time to reflect the period over which the member
receives the services provided. Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time.
Other revenue includes revenue from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over
which the personal trainer is operating, and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training
services which are both recognised at a point in time. Further detail on the timing of revenue
recognition is included in the revenue accounting policy in note 2.

Included within member income in 2022 is £5.3 million related to gift cards issued, but not utilised,
during 2020 and 2021. In 2022, it was concluded that the chance of these gift cards being utilised in
future periods was remote and therefore the deferred income has been released in the year.

Exceptional administrative income **(1.4)** (7.0)

Exceptional administrative (income) / expense **(1.0)** 6.9

Integration, transition and restructuring costs of £0.4m in 2022 relate to the rebranding of the Fitness
World business in Denmark to PureGym. Further costs in relation to the rebranding are expected to
be incurred in 2023.

Integration, transition and restructuring costs in 2021 of £2.1m primarily related to redundancy costs
incurred in relation to a reset of the Danish head office cost base. Costs incurred in the prior year
include costs relating to the integration of the Fitness World business into the wider group and
restructuring costs in Denmark.

Also in 2021, £10.9m of costs were incurred in the exploration of, and preparation for, capital fund
raising options, and costs of £0.7m were incurred relating to the exploration of expansion opportunities
in the USA.

On 3 November 2020, the landlord of a UK site exercised their lease break option and agreed
settlement consideration of £11.0m. The settlement was paid at the break date of the lease on 8 March
2021. The settlement was recognised on a straight line basis over the period from the activation of the
break clause to the break date of the lease with a credit of £5.9m recognised in 2021.

During 2022, a £1.4m credit (2021: £1.1m credit) was recognised in relation to VAT recoverable on
exceptional expenses incurred in previous periods. This recovery had previously been determined to
be not probable and therefore the payment of VAT was treated as an exceptional expense.

In 2021, in reaction to the gym closures required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group
took advantage of available government support schemes in each of its geographies, including
contributions towards wages and salaries of £17.4m in the year ended 31 December 2021. Grants
received were netted off the related costs in the statement of comprehensive income. No such grants
were received in 2022.

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes in the United Kingdom and Denmark for
all employees in those countries using master trust (occupational trust based) pension schemes. The
total cost expensed in the year was £2.9m (2021: £3.1m) and outstanding pension contributions at the
year-end were £0.3m (2021: £0.2m).

In addition, the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for employees in Switzerland. More
information is included in note 19.

The Directors and certain employees hold ordinary A1 and A2 shares in the Group, which have service
and vesting conditions attached and are therefore in the scope of IFRS 2 'Share based payments'.
Two tranches of shares have been issued (the “2017 shares” and the “2022 shares”). The directors
have applied a valuation model to calculate a grant date fair value of these shares for IFRS 2 purposes.
The 2017 shares have been valued at £2.39 per share. During the year ended 31 December 2022,
the estimated vesting date of the 2017 shares was re-assessed and extended. The resulting
adjustment to employee expenses has been re-calculated retrospectively and recognised in 2022.
Consequently, a charge of £0.1m has been recognised during the year (2021: £0.4m) and is included
within wages and salaries.

2021 loss before tax and the tax on loss at standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% have been
restated. A corresponding increase in 2021 unrecognised tax losses has been recognised. There is
no restatement of the total tax credit for 2021. Further details on the restatement are provided in note
30.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK was 19% throughout the year (2021: 19%) and
accordingly the Group’s profits for this period are taxed at this rate. Deferred tax has been measured
at the rate expected to apply at the time at which the timing differences are expected to reverse. This
ranges between 19% and 25%.

At the year end, the Group had losses from certain group companies carried forward for which a
deferred tax asset has not been recognised. These losses totalled £92.0m (2021: £110.6m) and the
unrecognised deferred tax asset totalled £23.0m (2021: £26.7m). The asset has not been recognised
as the directors are of the opinion that it is unlikely that suitable taxable profits will arise in those entities
in the foreseeable future.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group has begun the process of re-branding the Danish
estate from Fitness World to PureGym. As a result, an impairment of £23.3m has been recognised to
fully write down the Fitness World brand. The remaining net book value in relation to Brands at 31
December 2022 relates to the PureGym brand. This had an amortisation period of 20 years from the
date acquired and has a remaining amortisation period of 15 years.

Customer Relationships represent the fair value of customer relationships held in Denmark and
Switzerland at the time of the acquisition of the Fitness World group in January 2021. These assets
have a useful life of 5 years and a remaining amortisation period of 2 years.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the
group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. Customer Relationships and Brands are
allocated to the group of CGUs to which they relate and tested for impairment at the CGU or group of
CGUs level as these assets do not generate cash flows that are largely independent from other assets
in each CGU or group of CGUs. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) has been
determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. These have
been determined to result in a higher recoverable amount for the CGU than a fair value less costs of
disposal valuation. Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets
approved by management covering a five-year period.

The below table sets out the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each group of CGUs:

Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and
current plans for site refurbishments. The pre-tax discount rates reflect specific risks relating to the
Group and the markets in which it operates. The long-term growth rates are determined based on a
combination of industry and country-level forecasts.

An impairment of the goodwill in Denmark would have been recognised if the pre-tax discount rate
were increased by more than 168 basis points to at least 11.0%. An impairment would also have been
recognised if operating cashflows in the forecast period were to have been more than 9.0% lower than
forecast. No reasonably possible changes in other assumptions would be expected to lead to an
impairment of the Denmark goodwill.

An impairment of the goodwill in Switzerland would have been recognised if the pre-tax discount rate
were increased by more than 73 basis points to at least 9.1%. An impairment would also have been
recognised if operating cashflows in the forecast period were to have been more than 9.2% lower than
forecast. No reasonably possible changes in other assumptions would be expected to lead to an
impairment of the Switzerland goodwill.

An impairment of the goodwill in United Kingdom would have been recognised if the pre-tax discount
rate were increased by more than 150 basis points to at least 12.5%. An impairment would also have
been recognised if operating cashflows in the forecast period were to have been more than 9.2% lower
than forecast. No reasonably possible changes in other assumptions would be expected to lead to an
impairment of the United Kingdom goodwill.

###### 13 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

An impairment loss of £21.4m has been recognised for the year (2021: £10.5m) which is included
within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The below
table sets out the amount of impairment loss recognised in each operating segment:


**2022**

**£m**


2021

£m


United Kingdom **10.4** 5.3

Denmark **9.9**  
Switzerland **1.1** 5.2

Total impairment loss **21.4** 10.5

This impairment has been allocated proportionately across asset classes and relates to a small
number of gyms across the Group that have a value in use below the carrying amount of their nonfinancial assets. The values in use for the impaired CGUs of £42.7m (2021: £31.2m) have been
determined to result in higher recoverable amounts than using fair value less costs of disposal
valuations. An impairment indicator was identified during the year for all gyms open for more than 1
year due to the macroeconomic situation in the second half of 2022 which caused government bond
yields to rise, thus increasing discount rates in the United Kingdom and Denmark territories. The value
in use of the impaired gyms is based on estimated cashflows forecast to be generated post 1 January
2023.

Discount rates and long-term growth rates applied in the value in use calculations are determined at a
country level, and are as disclosed in note 12. If operating cash flows for the gyms reviewed for
impairment were to be 5% below forecasted levels, an additional impairment of £4.5m would have
been recognised. If the discount rate applied in the calculations were to be 50 basis points higher, an
additional impairment of £1.2m would have been recognised.

Disposals of the cost of right-of-use assets in the year of £55.2m (2021: £4.7m) relate to the termination
of leases and reductions in lease terms due to changes in the estimate of reasonably certain lease
termination dates. These have been treated as lease modifications under IFRS 16.

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all financial assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, financial assets have been grouped based on shared credit
risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on historical experience
of credit losses in the relevant geography.

On that basis, the loss allowance on trade and other receivables (excluding finance lease receivables)
as at 31 December 2022 is £nil (2021: £0.3m) as all trade receivables and other debtors are current
and the expected loss rate for the Group as a whole is 0% (2021: 2%). Trade receivables written off
in the year totalled £nil (2021: £nil).

A prior year adjustment has been recognised to reduce 2021 net trade receivables by £1.7m from
£6.4m to £4.7m, and reduce 2021 prepayments by £6.5m from £16.6m to £10.1m. See note 30 for
further details on the restatement.

Lease receivables arise where the Group has sub-leased property as a lessor which is presented as
part of right of use assets (note 13) and where that sub-lease has been classified as a finance lease.
The following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease receivables showing the undiscounted lease
payments to be received after the reporting date. Income receivable from finance leases is presented
within finance income (note 10). During the year ended 31 December 2022, modifications were made

leases.

Revenue recognised during 2022 that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning
of the period totalled £29.6m (2021: £36.3m). The amounts included in contract liabilities at 31
December 2022 are expected to be recognised in revenue during the next reporting period.

Contract liabilities – membership income has decreased by £4.0m between 31 December 2021 and
31 December 2022. This is due to a migration of the operating model in Switzerland, where a higher
proportion of customers now benefit from monthly no-contract memberships, rather than annual, paid
in-advance deals, and due to the release of deferred income on gift cards in Denmark.

A prior year adjustment has been recognised to increase 2021 contract liabilities – membership income
by £0.7m from £29.0m to £29.7m, and reduce 2021 VAT payable by £0.6m from £2.5m to £1.9m. See

The Group’s leases primarily relate to its gym premises, as well as offices, equipment and vehicles.
Leases for properties are typically made for fixed periods of 10 to 20 years. Lease terms are negotiated
on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or
rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease
payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against
the right-of-use asset.

The total cash outflow for leases during the year was £117.5m (2021: £98.2m).

During the year, the Group has applied the practical expedient to rent concessions as permitted in the
COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16. Included within administrative
expenses for the period is a credit of £5.1m relating to rent concessions agreed in the year. In 2021,
an amount of £17.8m was recognised relating to both Danish government contributions towards rent
received in the year and rent concessions agreed in the year.

Included within note 13 are additions to right-of-use assets during the year, the depreciation charge
for right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets incurred during the year, and the carrying amount
of right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets at the end of the year.

A maturity of analysis of lease liabilities as at the end of the year is included in note 21.

2027. Also within amounts owed to Group undertakings is £nil (2021: £0.4m) which is interest free and
repayable on demand.

**Financing**

The Group has £430 million of Senior Secured Notes (“the Sterling Notes”) and €490 million of Senior
Secured Notes (“the Euro Notes”) in issue (together, “the Notes”).

The Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange, for which Pinnacle Bidco PLC is the Issuer
and certain subsidiaries of the Group are guarantors. Interest on the Sterling Notes accrues at a rate
of 6.375% and interest on the Euro Notes accrues at a rate of 5.500% both payable at half-yearly
intervals. The Notes are due to be repaid in full on 15 February 2025.

On issue of the Euro Notes in 2020, these were recognised at fair value of €422.8 million representing
a discount on issue of €22.3 million. The Euro Notes are subsequently held at amortised cost with
changes in the carrying amount recognised within finance cost as an unwind of discount on issue of
senior secured notes.

Capitalised issue costs are amortised over the period to the repayment date of the Notes.

In addition, the Group has a revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) with seven international institutions
(Barclays Bank PLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse International, ING
Bank N.V. Lloyds Bank plc and Danske Bank A/S, collectively "the Lenders"), repayable 15 August
2024. Included within the total RCF is a £10 million overdraft facility. As at 31 December 2022 and 31
December 2021, the facility was undrawn.

Following amendments to the terms of the RCF on 18 September 2020, and further amendments on
7 January 2021, the Lenders granted a waiver of the pre-existing financial covenants on the RCF for
the remainder of the term. The financial covenant is replaced with a £30 million minimum liquidity test
on the last day of March, June, September and December each year.

The Group has been in compliance with all such covenants and tests during the current and previous
financial years.

Dilapidations provisions relate to the requirement for the Group to restore leased premises to their
original condition at the end of the respective lease term. Other provisions related to future obligations
for other matters such as outstanding litigation. Outflows related to Dilapidations provisions are
expected to materialise over the next 1 to 25 years, depending on the length of the Group’s lease
terms. In estimating the timing of outflows, the Group has assumed that leases will be exited at the
end of the lease terms, but there is uncertainty over whether leases will be extended or exited early
which would alter the timing of the outflow. Included within additions during the year is a £10.8m uplift
in estimated outflows on leases which existed prior to 2022 which were reassessed due to changes in
forecast cost of restoration, expected likelihood of outflows being payable, and discount rates.

_Defined pension benefits_

The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland, which pays benefits as per the
Federal Law on Occupational Benefits. The plan is organised as a contribution-based scheme as per
Article 15 of the Swiss Federal Law on Vesting in Pension Plans. Retirement benefits of active
participants accrue over a notional account as the sum of retirement credits (retirement credit rate
multiplied by pensionable salary) and interests. The Group mitigates the risks of a pension deficit by
insuring the liability with the pension foundation Allianz.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 20 Financial instruments (continued)

Set out below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all the financial instruments as
carried in the financial statements, other than lease liabilities and those for which the fair value
approximates closely with their carrying value. The fair value of senior secured notes is taken from the
quoted market price. This is a Level 1 valuation. The fair value of all other borrowings are calculated
by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a Level 2
valuation.

_Fair value hierarchy_

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects
the significance of the inputs used in the value measurements:

  - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets

  - Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted
prices in active markets; and

  - Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique.

There were no transfers between levels throughout the period under review.

###### 21 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk, credit
risk, and market risk arising from interest rate and foreign exchange risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s
objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has
overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.

**_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. The key market risks affecting the Group are interest rate risk
and foreign exchange rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain
borrowings and deposits. Financial instruments affected by exchange rate risk include the Euro Notes.
At 31 December 2022, the €490 million Euro Notes had a carrying amount of £423.5m (2021: £397.0m)
based on an amortised cost of €478.1m (2021: €473.0m) and an exchange rate of 0.886 (2021: 0.839).
Had the exchange rate at 31 December 2022 been 10% higher, then the Group’s loss for the year
would have increased by £42.3m (2021: £39.5m). Foreign exchange risk on the Group’s Euro Notes
is partially mitigated through the cash flows and value of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries
denominated in Danish Krone. Danish Krone is pegged against the Euro. The effectiveness of this
mitigation depends on the relative value of the Group’s Danish operations.

###### 21 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

As at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate
instruments by way of senior secured notes, amounts owed to group undertakings, and lease liabilities.
The Group has access to a £145m (2021: £145m) revolving credit facility with floating interest rates
but was not drawn down on this facility at the end of the period.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity
profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The
table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s undiscounted contractual cash flows on
financial liabilities and includes contractual future interest payments:

Total financial liabilities 246.5 1,295.7 1,196.6 2,738.8 2,000.9

**_Credit risk_**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade receivables. The Group’s
credit risk is minimised due to exposure being spread over a large number of customers who generally
pay by direct debit in advance. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Quantitative data is
included in the consolidated statement of financial position and in note 15.

£506.0m), and £1.1m owed by the ultimate UK parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited (2021: £0.4m
owed to Pinnacle Topco Limited). Associated interest charged to the income statement in the year
totalled £37.8m (2021: £35.1m).

###### 30 Correction of £5.3m error overstating Swiss revenue in 2021

In 2022, management identified a computational error in the way in which revenue was being
calculated in the Swiss operating segment, impacting the 2021 and previous financial years.

The error was confined to the Swiss operating segment and resulted from the use of legacy systems
for the calculation of revenue, which had only been used by the Swiss operating segment. These had
been in place since before the operating segment’s acquisition by the Group.

The error resulted in an overstatement of revenue, and a corresponding overstatement of prepayments
and trade receivables (presented in the Balance Sheet within trade and other receivables) and
understatement of contract liabilities – membership income (presented in the Balance Sheet under
trade and other payables). The error also resulted in an overstatement of VAT payable (presented in
the Balance Sheet under trade and other payables) in line with the overstatement of revenue.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
###### 30 Correction of £5.3m error overstating Swiss revenue in 2021 (continued)

As a result of the error, the December 2021 impairment review of the property, plant and equipment
of the CGUs in Switzerland was reconsidered. In doing so the value in use of the 6 affected gyms was
reduced by £1.2 million and an additional impairment of that amount has been recognised.

# Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC

## Report on the audit of the financial statements

###### Opinion

In our opinion:

- Pinnacle Bidco PLC’s group financial statements and company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give
a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the
Group’s loss and the Group’s cash flows for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting
standards;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure
Framework”, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual report and consolidated financial statements (the
“Annual Report”), which comprise: Consolidated and Company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2021;
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated cash flow statement and Consolidated and Company
statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a
description of the significant accounting policies.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

###### Our audit approach

**Overview**

Audit scope

- Our significant components were determined in relation to their contribution to the Group's financial result or the
Group's financial position

- The Group audit consisted of full scope audits over three significant components; Pinnacle Bidco Plc, Pure Gym
Limited and Fitness World A/S and audit procedures over Prepayments and accrued income, Trade debtors,
Deferred income, Provisions, Right of use assets and Lease liabilities in PureGym AG

- In addition, centrally managed functions, including the Group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the
group engagement team

Key audit matters

- Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment (group)

- Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland (group)


-----

- Risk of impairment of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables (company)

Materiality

- Overall group materiality: £3,000,000 (2020: £3,850,000) based on 1% of revenue of Pinnacle Bidco group (2020:
2.5% of a 3-year average EBITDA of the proforma Pinnacle Topco group from 2018 to 2020 i.e. including Fitness
World).

- Overall company materiality: £1,500,000 (2020: £1,500,000) based on 1% of total assets, capped below Group
materiality as part of our component materiality allocations.

- Performance materiality: £1,875,000 (2020: £2,887,500) (group) and £1,125,000 (2020: £1,312,500) (company).

**The scope of our audit**

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and
any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the UK, Risk of misstatement from lease accounting, Risk of
misstatement from acquisition accounting, Risk of misstatement from consolidation, and Covid-19, which were key audit
matters last year, are no longer included because our assessment of the overall level of risk has reduced in these areas.
Specifically our assessment of risk of impairment of UK Goodwill and intangibles has reduced based on the improved
performance of the business in the current period and significant headroom within the impairment assessment, reducing
the risk of estimation uncertainty. Acquisition accounting was a one-off item in the prior year. The risk of consolidation
of the enlarged group related to this acquisition and the related risk from lease accounting also reduced. Covid-19 is
now considered to be an ongoing matter impacting upon the trading environment of all entities. Otherwise, the key audit
matters below are consistent with last year.

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|
|Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment (group) The Group holds a significant amount of right of use (‘ROU’) assets and other property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’) on the balance sheet, amounting to a net book value of £677m at the year end (2020: £718m). The challenging trading environment for the gym sector as a result of Covid-19 has meant that there is the possibility of impairment trigger events and therefore the impairment of ROU assets and other PPE remains a significant risk. Each gym is considered an individual cash generating unit (‘CGU’) and assessed individually for evidence of any impairment triggers, principally by reference to the performance of the individual gyms. The identification of impairment triggers requires management to exercise judgement. For those gyms where an impairment assessment is required management have prepared discounted cash flows to support the carrying value of the associated assets. The discounted cash flows include a number of estimates, with the key assumptions being: • The forecasted cash flows of the individual gym; • The long term growth rate used within the forecasts; and • The discount rate applied to the cash flows.|.• We have reviewed the forecast financial performance of the gyms within each territory and held discussions with management to understand their assessment of potential impairment indicators; • We have understood management's process for budgeting and forecasting and have obtained management's CGU impairment model for each CGU; • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non current assets being assessed for impairment to the underlying accounting records; • We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts by reviewing actual results to previous forecasts taking account of the significant impact Covid-19 has had on performance in the last two years; • We assessed the cash flow projections used in the impairment model in comparison to the|

Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any material adjustments to the carrying value of the Group’s ROU assets or PPE at year end.|
|---|---|
|Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland (group) The Group holds £805m of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet at the year end (2020: £847m). Within these balances are amounts relating specifically to the Fitness World Group businesses in Denmark and Switzerland acquired in 2020 (additions on acquisition in 2020 of £347m). Management are required to perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill and test for impairment of other intangible assets where there are indicators of impairment. Impairment assessments of this nature involve subjective judgements and estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. We focused specifically on Denmark and Switzerland group's of CGU’s due to the relatively lower degree of impairment headroom compared to the UK. For each group of CGUs management have prepared discounted cash flows to support the carrying value of the associated assets. The discounted cash flows include a number of estimates, with the key assumptions being: • The forecasted cash flows of the individual gym; • The long term growth rate used within the forecasts; and • The discount rate applied to the cash flows. Management have recognised an impairment charge in relation to Goodwill and other intangible assets of £5.8m during the year (2020: £24.5m). See the Critical accounting estimates and judgements policies section within the Group financial statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, judgements and estimates and Note 12 within the Group financial statements for details of the intangible assets balances.|• We have understood management's process for budgeting and forecasting and have obtained management's impairment model for each group of CGUs; • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non current assets being assessed for impairment to the underlying accounting records; • We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts by reviewing actual results to previous forecasts taking account of the significant impact Covid-19 has had on performance in the last two years; • We assessed the cash flow projections used in the impairment model in comparison to the trading environment and industry reports, and our understanding of performance from other aspects of our audit, including our consideration of the impact of climate change on the business; • We utilised specialists to assess the discount rates and long term growth rates used within the impairment models for each CGU; • We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to quantify the downside changes needed to trigger an impairment, or to increase the impairment charges recognised. • We also assessed the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the key assumptions. Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any material adjustments to the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets in Denmark and Switzerland at year end.|
|Risk of impairment of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables (company) The Company has investments in subsidiaries amounting to £308.2m (2020: £308.2.m) and amounts due from Group undertakings of £914.2m (2020: £899.3m). Investments are reviewed annually for|• We evaluated management's process for assessing impairment triggers for investment in subsidiaries and management’s IFRS 9|

Where necessary, the impairment review in respect of the investment balance is performed in conjunction with the annual impairment review of goodwill and acquired intangible assets at a group level. Amounts due from Group undertakings are considered as part of managements IFRS 9 expected credit loss assessment. We focused on these balances given their size, the performance of the Company's investments in the year and the judgements and estimates required to forecast future financial performance. No impairment charge has been recorded by management in the year (2020: nil).

Based on the procedures performed we did not identify any material adjustments to the carrying value of the Company's investments in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables at year end.|

**How we tailored the audit scope**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which they operate.

We scoped the audit with three significant components. This included the two largest trading entities, Pure Gym Limited
(UK) and Fitness World A/S (Denmark), which contribute the majority of the trading results. We also included in our
scope one holding company, Pinnacle Bidco Plc, which has issued the Group’s external borrowings, and has the
associated interest expense. We also scoped in specific audit procedures over Prepayments and accrued income, Trade
debtors, Deferred income, Provisions, Right of use assets and Lease liabilities in PureGym AG (Switzerland). In addition,
centrally managed functions, including the Group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the group
engagement team.

**Materiality**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:


-----

|Col1|Financial statements - group|Financial statements - company|
|---|---|---|
|Overall materiality|£3,000,000 (2020: £3,850,000).|£1,500,000 (2020: £1,500,000).|
|How we determined it|1% of revenue of Pinnacle Bidco group (2020: 2.5% of a 3-year average EBITDA of the proforma Pinnacle Topco group from 2018 to 2020 i.e. including Fitness World)|1% of total assets, capped below Group materiality as part of our component materiality allocations|
|Rationale for benchmark applied|Revenue benchmark has been used as it most closely aligns to three of the Group’s Key Performance Indicators (Revenue, Membership Numbers, Number of Gyms). These KPIs are consistent with business growth ambitions through increased membership and improved revenue performance. The 3-year average EBITDA of the proforma Pinnacle Topco group that was used as a benchmark in 2020 is less relevant in the current year due to two years of adverse impact of Covid-19 on EBITDA performance.|We believe that total assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark due to it being a holding company.|


For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £1,500,000 and £2,850,000. Certain
components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected
and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining
the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and
disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 62.5% (2020: 75%) of overall
materiality, amounting to £1,875,000 (2020: £2,887,500) for the Group financial statements and £1,125,000 (2020:
£1,312,500) for the Company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk
assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount in the middle of our
normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit
above £ 150,000 (group audit) (2020: £ 192,500) and £ 75,000 (company audit) (2020: £87,500) as well as
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

###### Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group's and the Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting included:

- Obtaining the Directors' Group level going concern assessment paper and cash flow forecasts to June 2023. We
tested the cash flow forecasts for mathematical accuracy;

- Performing look back procedures to assess management’s forecasting accuracy;

- Evaluating the forecasts against current trading conditions and assessing the reasonableness of the key
assumptions driving the cashflows;

- Assessing the Group's banking facilities, associated banking covenant requirements in the going concern
assessment period and banking covenant waivers received prior to the year end;

- Challenging management on their contingency plans for potential future lockdowns, and the resilience of the
business to withstand additional periods of closure;

- Vouched the post year-end receipt of £300m investment from an equity investor in the Group and reviewed the
forecasts and projections in light of this investment.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.


-----

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the
Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

###### Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency
or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement
of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain
opinions and matters as described below.

**Strategic report and Directors' report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and
Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2021 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

###### Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.


-----

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to health and safety legislation, employment law, and data protection legislation, and we
considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also
considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as tax legislation and
the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the
financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to
posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or EBITDA, and management bias in accounting estimates,
specifically those relating to the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, right of use assets and property, plant and
equipment. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could
include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group
engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- discussions with management including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws
and regulation and fraud;

- assessment of compliance with local laws and regulations and relevant tax legislation by each component audit team
and the group audit team, as applicable

- identifying and testing journal entries using a risk-based targeting approach for unexpected account combinations,
specifically those to increase revenue, reduce costs or reclassify items above or below the EBITDA line to manipulate
the financial performance of the business;

- obtaining management's impairment models to assess the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, right of use
assets and property, plant and equipment;

- reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation, where appropriate, to assess
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data
auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing
complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics.
In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample
is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

## Other required reporting

###### Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or


-----

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

###### 1 General information

The principal activity of the Group during the year was the provision of facilities for physical fitness and
is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. Pinnacle Bidco PLC (“the Company”) and its
subsidiaries are limited by shares and are registered, incorporated and domiciled in England, United
Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered office is C/O Pure Gym Limited, Town Centre
House, Merrion Centre, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS2 8LY, United Kingdom.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance
with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. On 31 December
2020, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union at that
date was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, with future
changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Group transitioned to UKadopted International Accounting Standards in its consolidated financial statements on 1 January
2021. This change constitutes a change in accounting framework. However, there is no impact on
recognition, measurement or disclosure in the period reported as a result of the change in framework.

The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified
for the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The
Group financial statements are presented in thousands of pounds sterling (“£’000”) except when
otherwise indicated. Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all financial periods
presented.

The preparation of the Group financial statements in conformity with UK-IFRS requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based
on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ
from those estimates.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2021. The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated
for the period from the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for using the
acquisition method. Uniform accounting policies are applied throughout the Group.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker, identified as the Executive Management Team of the Group. The Executive
Management Team primarily consider the business from a geographical perspective, by country of
operation. The Group’s operations consist solely of the provision of high quality health and fitness
facilities and associated services and consequently, it is not necessary to segregate operating
segments by service or product. The Executive Management Team use the measures of Revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA as key performance indicators in assessing the performance of the operating
segments. A definition of Adjusted EBITDA is included in note 4.


-----

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

The Group’s material reportable segments are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland. The
results from operations in all other countries in which the Group operates are included in “All other
segments”, as they are deemed to be individually immaterial.

**Going Concern**

In light of the on-going impact of Covid-19 on the performance of the Group, the Directors have
carefully evaluated the Going Concern basis of preparation.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements, capex and funding of new sites through
its cash reserves and credit facilities, being an RCF facility of £145 million which includes an overdraft
of £10 million.

As at 20 April 2022, the date of signing the financial statements, the Group’s forecasts and projections
(to 30 June 2023) taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and potential
future lockdowns, showed that the Group should be able to operate within its existing facilities.

This assessment included the impact of Omicron on early 2022 trading, no extension of Government
support and the expectation of continued COVID-19 disruption on core trading across 2022 including,
for Going Concern review purposes, a new national lockdown in all geographies.

On an unmitigated basis the Group has a weekly cash burn of approximately £9.0 million per week,
including interest and tax. By factoring in historical government mitigation measures across all
territories and management mitigation measures, total weekly cash burn (including interest and capex)
has historically been reduced to approximately £4.5 million.

Government mitigations include payroll support, fixed cost contributions and grants whilst
management mitigations include reducing all unnecessary activity, tight cost control and the delay of
planned investments.

The actions taken have been designed to protect the medium and long term prospects of the business
and, with available liquidity of £177 million (as at 31 December 2021), plus an additional £300 million
received in January 2022 following investment from KKR, the Directors consider that the Group has
sufficient facilities to withstand over 2 years of full Group closure from the start of 2022. Liquidity as at
31 March 2022 stood at £449 million, of which £30 million is held by parent company, Pinnacle Topco
Limited.

Based on these forecasts, and with no leverage or cash flow covenants until 2024, the Directors have
concluded that the Group has adequate resources to continue to remain a going concern for the
foreseeable future and have therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing its financial
statements.

**Revenue**

Revenue primarily represents sales of services provided in the period and non refundable joining fees
received during the period, exclusive of value added tax. Member income includes membership
subscriptions and joining fee income. Membership subscriptions are received in advance of the period
to which they relate and are recognised as contract liabilities. The performance obligation attached to
membership subscriptions is satisfied over time, on a straight line basis over the membership period
as this best represents the timing of services provided.

Where there are specific performance obligations attached to joining fees, then the income related to
this is recognised in the period in which membership commences since the performance obligation
attached to that income is satisfied in that period. Where there are no specific performance obligations
attached to joining fees, these are recognised over time, on a straight line basis over the expected
duration of the membership.


-----

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time. Other revenue includes revenue
from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over which the personal trainer is
operating, and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training services vouchers which
are both recognised at a point in time.

**Other Income**

Other income represents income arising outside of the Group’s ordinary activities, being the running
of gyms, provision of gym-related services, and the sale of vending and consumable items. It includes
income from insurance claims.

**Cost of sales**

Cost of sales represents the cost arising in connection with the generation of revenue from the “vending
and consumables income” and “other revenue” revenue streams, including the cost of inventories sold.

**Intangible assets**
**(a) Goodwill**
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to
each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the
Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill is not amortised, instead impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU,
or group of CGUs, containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher
of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as
an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

**_(b) Intangible assets acquired in business combinations_**
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the
date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement
utilising valuation expertise and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental
cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore,
management must estimate the expected useful life of intangible assets and charge amortisation on
these assets accordingly, the value of which is shown within administrative expenses. The useful life
estimated for assets acquired in business combinations varies based on the characteristics of the
particular asset, and are set out in note 12. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
include customer relationships and brands. For the purpose of impairment testing, intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


-----

**(c) Software**
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets where the following
criteria are met:

- It is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- Management intends to complete the software and use it in the course of business

- There is an ability to use the software

- It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the
software are available, and

- The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Until the software is ready for use, capitalised development costs are presented within “Development
Projects in Progress” and are not amortised. Once the software is ready for use, the capitalised costs
are transferred into the “Software” category and amortised over a period of 3 to 5 years.

**Inventories**

Inventories primarily relate to goods for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Inventories are valued on a
first in, first out basis.

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost, including those costs that were directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition. Any capital contribution by a landlord towards
leasehold fitting out works is deducted from the cost of property, plant and equipment within that
leasehold. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less provisions for
depreciation and impairment.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset (less residual value) over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Right-of-use assets Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold costs Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold improvements Straight line over the shorter of 3-15 years or remaining lease life

Fixtures and fittings Straight line over 3-10 years

IT equipment Straight line over 3-5 years

Residual values are calculated where appropriate based on agreed buyback terms with suppliers.

**Leases as a lessee**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

The Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


-----

The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right of use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
More information on the determination of the lease term is included in note 3.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate using the interest rates from recent third party
funding, with adjustments appropriate for the lease term and security to make it specific to a particular
lease.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

  - fixed payments, including in substance fixed payments; and

  - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index
or rate as at the commencement date.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if the Group
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if
there is a revised in substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying
amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss as ‘profit on lease modifications’ if the
carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right of use assets as part of ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities
as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.

A small number of property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated
from a particular gym. For certain gyms, up to 100% of lease payments are on the basis of variable
payment terms with a range of percentages as a proportion of sales. Variable lease payments that
depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those
payments occurs.

**Leases as a lessor**

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance
lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the
case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment,
the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic
life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right- of-use
asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a shortterm lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease
as an operating lease.

**Financial instruments**

**_Financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises financial liabilities at fair value where applicable (net of any transaction
costs) and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where the Group has borrowings, transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest method
over the life of the loan. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations
are discharged, cancelled, or expire. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised as finance
income or finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge risks associated with interest rate movements or foreign
exchange. The Group initially recognises such instruments at fair value where applicable and
subsequently remeasures at each balance sheet date.

**_Financial assets_**

The Group classifies its financial assets as ‘those to be measured at amortised cost’ or ‘those to be
measured subsequently at fair value’. At initial recognition, the Group measures its financial assets at
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial
assets carried at FVPL are expensed in the profit or loss.

**_Financial assets (continued)_**

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other
receivables. These assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets
in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise,
on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.

**Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Impairment of financial assets**

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all financial assets. To measure the expected credit losses,
financial assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before
31 December and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The
historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


-----

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready for use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation or
depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This is deemed to occur when the cash generating unit
to which the asset belongs is performing below expectation. For property, plant and equipment this is
generally deemed to be when the CGU to which it belongs is loss making more than three years after
opening.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash generating units). The Group’s CGUs
consist of individual gyms.

Goodwill, customer relationships and brands are assessed at the group of CGUs level, where each
gym represents a CGU. No group of CGUs is at a level higher than an operating segment.

Prior impairments of non financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at
each reporting date.

Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where it is not possible to isolate cash flows
generated by a specific item of property, plant and equipment, impairment is tested at the CGU level,
representing a single gym. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


-----

On certain of its leases, the Group is required to restore leased premises to their original condition at
the end of the respective lease term. Where it is deemed probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the restoration obligation, a provision is recognised for the present value of the
estimated expenditure required to remove leasehold improvements. The associated cost is capitalised
as part of the leasehold improvements and amortised over the shorter of the lease term or the useful
life of the assets.

**Pension obligations**

For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an
employee benefit expense when they are due.

The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of
plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method.

The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on
high quality corporate bonds in the currency the benefits are paid. An extrapolation of current market
rates along the yield curve takes place to determine the necessary discount rates for the valuation of
the pension liabilities.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the
statement of profit or loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income.
They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service costs.

**Government grants**

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and recognised in the
same line item in the statement of comprehensive income.

**Taxation**

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


-----

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so
to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of
income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature and
amount. Examples of items included within exceptional items are restructuring and transformational
costs, and costs relating to acquisitions or certain expansion projects. Impairments of intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment are not included within exceptional items, but are presented
separately in note 6. Management consider, on a case by case basis, whether costs are exceptional
based on the specific circumstances.

**New and amended standards**

No new or amended accounting standards or interpretations had an impact on the financial statements
in the current year, and no material impact on the financial statements is expected from known future
new or amended accounting standards.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and judgements
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Estimates**

_Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based
on the recoverable amount of its cash generating units (‘CGUs’). The Group also assesses whether
any events have occurred which would trigger an impairment review of non-financial assets with finite
useful lives such as intangible assets other than goodwill and property, plant and equipment, including
the expected impact of COVID 19 on the short to medium term profitability of each CGU.

Where this is the case, the recoverable amount of the CGU being assessed is determined based on
value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the
determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)


-----

Management also consider whether reasonably possible changes in key assumptions may cause an
impairment of the non-financial assets. A summary of the key assumptions used, and the possibility of
impairment, should reasonably possible changes in those key assumptions occur, is included in note
12.

_Provisions for leasehold dilapidations_

Provisions are made for dilapidations of leasehold improvements in leased properties. Management
make estimates of the amount and timing of future payments in relation to the restoration of leased
properties based on contractual obligations, historic experience and the views of experts. Where it is
assessed that the likelihood of an outflow of resources to settle a restoration obligation on leased
premises is probable, a provision is made for the expected future outflow, discounted to present value
using a discount rate of between 0.5% and 2% to reflect the time value of money. The discount rate is
based on risk-free costs of borrowing in the relevant jurisdictions.

As at 31 December 2021, management have determined that a provision is required for 216 out of its
509 leased premises. Details of the provision recorded are included in note 19. If the future cost of
restoration for a site where a provision has been recorded were to increase by 10%, the provision at
31 December 2021 would increase by £1,002,000.

_Incremental borrowing rate for discounting of lease liabilities_

The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments in the calculation of lease
liabilities. The use of this method requires estimates of interest rates which would be available to the
Group if it were to borrow funds, over a similar term and with a similar security, necessary to obtain an
asset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. Management utilise
internal and external information to determine an appropriate rate. This includes evidence arising from
the Group’s recent third-party borrowings, publicly available borrowing rates for companies with similar
characteristics to the Group, and risk-free interest rates applicable in the relevant geographies in which
the Group operates. IBRs applied to leases across the Group range from 4.9% to 9.5%. Details of the
lease liabilities recognised are included in note 17.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_

The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there
will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be
deducted.

Management makes an estimate of the future taxable profits of the Group and compares this to the
available losses, taking into account applicable tax laws in the relevant geographies. In making the
estimate, management uses board-approved budgets for a 3 to 4 year period after the end of the
reporting period, then assumes no further growth in profits beyond this point in the absence of detailed
budgets for that period. Estimation uncertainty increases in later years of the forecast period due to
the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future profits. Detail of the tax charge and deferred tax asset
are set out in note 11.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)


-----

**Judgements**

_Lease terms on leased properties_

The Group recognises leased properties in accordance with IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The lease term is
determined as the non-cancellable period of each lease, together with periods covered by an option
to extend the lease if management are reasonably certain to exercise that option. Certain of the
Group’s leases include clauses which allow the Group to unilaterally extend the lease on a rolling
basis. Management exercise significant judgement in determining the period over which they are
reasonably certain that they will continue to extend such leases. In making this assessment on a leaseby-lease basis, management consider the following factors:

  - The prevailing market conditions relative to the contractual lease terms

  - Significant leasehold improvements undertaken that are expected to have a significant
economic benefit for the Group

  - Costs relating to the termination of the lease

  - The importance of the gym to the Group’s operations; and

  - The Group’s past practice on extending leases beyond their contractual terms.

At 31 December 2021, for gyms which include such clauses the average difference between lease
term and contractual term is one year (2020: one year).

_Classification of exceptional administrative expenses_

The Group presents exceptional administrative expenses separately within the statement of
comprehensive income. The Group exercises judgement in determining which expenses are
categorised as exceptional bearing in mind the size and nature of the expenses and associated
projects.

###### 4 Operating segments

The group’s material reportable segments in the current period are the United Kingdom, Denmark and
Switzerland. The results from operations in all other countries in which the Group operates are included
in “All other segments”. Segmental information presented to the Executive Management Team for the

Adjusted EBITDA (after rent deferments) 7,361 4,083 (40) - 11,404

All operating segments derive revenue from all of the services and products included within note 5. All
revenue included in the table above derives from external customers.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure derived by adjusting operating profit for depreciation,
amortisation, profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease
modifications, impairment of property, plant and equipment, exceptional costs, share based payment
charges, pre opening costs, other adjustments and the cash rent adjustment. The cash rent adjustment
includes an add back of any property rent related expenses charged in the statement of
comprehensive income (including COVID-related grant income on properties and rent-free
concessions agreed) and a deduction of contractual property rent payments due in the period (whether
or not paid in cash in the period). Adjusted EBITDA is stated both before and after rent deferments
which relate to property rent deferments agreed with landlords due to COVID-19 gym closures.

The Adjusted EBITDA KPI is typically used within the industry as it is more effective than operating
profit in representing the performance of the business and, as such, is a key focus of our stakeholders,
including our investors, our bondholders and our banking partners. A reconciliation from operating
profit to Adjusted EBITDA is included in note 6.

###### 5 Revenue

Revenue is analysed by service or product as follows:


**2021**

**£’000**


2020

£’000


Member income **273,747** 244,071

Vending and consumables income **15,931** 14,402

Other revenue **18,011** 11,468

**307,689** 269,941

As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, the Group was forced to close some or all of its gyms across
the estate at varying times throughout both years presented, and this has caused a significant
reduction in revenue for the Group during the closure and recovery periods. All gyms in the estate
initially closed between 12 and 21 March 2020. By the end of August 2020 all gyms across the estate
had re-opened, but a resurgence of COVID 19 infections across Europe in the autumn and winter led
to further localised and national lockdowns with associated gym closures lasting until May 2021.

###### 5 Revenue (continued)


-----

For members in the United Kingdom and Denmark, during the closure periods, all memberships were
automatically frozen meaning that no payments for gym subscriptions were taken from members
during this time.

Prior to and during the closure periods, our Swiss business operated a subscription model. Under this
model, amounts paid by members in advance for any closure period were deferred such that revenue
for gym subscriptions was only recognised when gyms were open. Where membership renewals fell
within the closure period, payment was taken from members as usual, but an extended membership
term provided to cover the closure periods.

The majority of member income is recognised over time to reflect the period over which the member
receives the services provided. Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time.
Other revenue includes revenue from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over
which the personal trainer is operating, and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training
services which are both recognised at a point in time. Further detail on the timing of revenue
recognition is included in the revenue accounting policy in note 2.

_1 Group Reported EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure defined as earnings before net finance cost, taxation, depreciation,_
_amortisation, profit/loss on sale of property, plant & equipment, impairment, profit/loss on lease modifications and_
_exceptional items._

_2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure derived from Group Reported EBITDA and adjusted by the items described_
_in footnotes 3 to 6. This is a relevant measure as it is an alternative performance measure defined within the Group’s_
_facility agreements._

_3 Refers to the net impact of various one-off items not included in “exceptional administrative expenses”. In 2021, the_
_Group incurred costs of £3.2 million in relation to the wind up of a Fitness World IT project resulting from convergence_
_of the Group’s IT infrastructure following the Fitness World acquisition. This amount is added back in reaching Adjusted_
_EBITDA to align with the treatment of the remaining costs for the IT project which were also added back in reaching_
_Adjusted EBITDA as part of “Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” in the year ended 31_
_December 2020._

_Also in 2021, £3.6 million of costs have been incurred in relation to a management “lock-in” bonus scheme. This amount_
_is added back in reaching Adjusted EBITDA because it has not been incurred in the ordinary course of business._

_4 Pre-opening costs represent the total of all gym site operating costs incurred prior to the opening of a new gym and_
_primarily consist of staff costs, marketing and rent expense._

_5 Under IFRS 16, most lease costs are included within interest or depreciation expenses and are therefore excluded from_
_Group Reported EBITDA. To produce a comparable and more relevant EBITDA figure, the contractual property rent_
_payments due during the accounting period are deducted and any property rent related expenses included in Group_
_Reported EBITDA are added back._

_6 The share based payment charge relates to shares in the ultimate parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited, issued to_
_directors and certain employees. See note 9 of the financial statements._

_7 Rent deferments relates to property rent deferments agreed with landlords due to COVID-19 gym closures._

Settlement on break of lease **(5,931)** (5,019)

Release of an over-accrual for historical VAT liabilities **(970)**  
Costs relating to acquisitions **-** (40)

Exceptional administrative income **(6,901)** (5,059)

Exceptional administrative expense **6,933** 3,821

Integration, transition and restructuring costs of £2,069,000 (2020: £4,894,000) primarily related to
redundancy costs incurred in relation to a reset of the Danish head office cost base. Costs incurred in
the prior year include costs relating to the integration of the Fitness World business into the wider
group and restructuring costs in Denmark.

£10,874,000 of costs were incurred in the exploration of, and preparation for, capital fund raising
options (2020: £nil).

Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic of £160,000 were incurred during the year (2020:
£3,030,000). These costs included one-off deep cleans of gyms at the end of the closure period, fees
for consultants engaged to provide advice on safe operation, and reviews of ventilation in gyms to
ensure that they comply with our COVID-19 TrainSafe protocols.

Costs of £731,000 were incurred relating to the exploration of expansion opportunities in the USA
(2020: £956,000 relating to various expansion and diversification opportunities).

On 3 November 2020, the landlord of a UK site exercised their lease break option and agreed
settlement consideration of £10,950,000. The settlement was paid at the break date of the lease on 8
March 2021. The settlement was recognised on a straight line basis over the period from the activation
of the break clause to the break date of the lease with a credit of £5,931,000 recognised in 2021 (2020:
£5,019,000).

During 2021, a £970,000 over-accrual for historical VAT liabilities was released as it was concluded
that the likelihood of the amount being payable was remote.

**88,709** 80,121

In reaction to the gym closures required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group took
advantage of available government support schemes in each of its geographies, including
contributions towards wages and salaries of £17,371,000 in the year ended 31 December 2021 (2020:
£16,422,000). Grants received have been netted off the related costs in the statement of
comprehensive income.

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes in the United Kingdom and Denmark for
all employees in those countries using master trust (occupational trust based) pension schemes. The
total cost expensed in the year was £3,129,000 (2020: £2,448,000) and outstanding pension
contributions at the year-end were £220,000 (2020: £418,000).

In addition, the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for employees in Switzerland. More
information is included in note 19.

The Directors and certain employees hold ordinary A1 and A2 shares in the Company, which have
service and vesting conditions attached and are therefore in the scope of IFRS 2 'Share based
payments'. The directors have applied a valuation model to calculate a grant date fair value of these
shares for IFRS 2 purposes as £2.39 per share. Consequently, a charge of £427,000 has been
recognised during the year (2020: £357,000) and is included within wages and salaries.

The amounts set out above include emoluments in respect of the highest paid director totalling
£1,352,000 (2020: £688,000). Contributions to defined contribution schemes of the highest paid
director were £nil (2020: £nil).

The key management of the Group are deemed to be the same as the directors of the Group, therefore
no additional disclosure of key management compensation has been provided.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK was 19% throughout the year (2020: 19%) and
accordingly the Group’s profits for this period are taxed at this rate. Deferred tax has been measured
at the rate expected to apply at the time at which the timing differences are expected to reverse. This
ranges between 19% and 25%.

and the unrecognised deferred tax asset totalled £25,427,000 (2020: £8,789,000). The asset has not
been recognised as the directors are of the opinion that it is unlikely that suitable taxable profits will
arise in those entities in the foreseeable future.

###### 12 Intangible assets (continued)

Development Projects in Progress and Software consist of capitalised development costs, being an
internally generated intangible asset. In the year ended 31 December 2020, Software assets and
associated accumulated depreciation were transferred from property, plant and equipment to
intangible assets.

Brands encompass the PureGym, Fitness World, and Basefit brands acquired as part of business
combinations and valued at fair value at the date of acquisition. In 2021, an impairment charge of
£4,086,000 was recognised representing the entire carrying amount of the Basefit brand following a
strategic decision to rebrand the Swiss estate under the PureGym brand. The remaining amortisation
periods of the brands are:

PureGym: 16 years

Fitness World: 18 years

Customer Relationships represent the fair value of customer relationships held in Denmark and
Switzerland at the time of the acquisition of the Fitness World group in January 2020. These assets
have a useful life of 5 years and a remaining amortisation period of 3 years.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the
group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. Customer Relationships and Brands are
allocated to the group of CGUs to which they relate and tested for impairment at the CGU or group of
CGUs level as these assets do not generate cash flows that are largely independent from other assets
in each CGU or group of CGUs. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) has been
determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. These have
been determined to result in a higher recoverable amount for the CGU than a fair value less costs of
disposal valuation. Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets
approved by management covering a four-year period.

The below table sets out the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each group of CGUs:

Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and
current plans for site refurbishments. The pre-tax discount rates reflect specific risks relating to the
Group and the markets in which it operates. The long-term growth rates are determined based on a
combination of industry and country-level forecasts.

An impairment of the goodwill in Denmark would have been recognised if the pre-tax discount rate
were increased by more than 170 basis points to at least 10.5%. An impairment would also have been
recognised if revenue in the forecast period were to have been more than 3.1% lower than forecast,
with no corresponding fall in costs. No reasonably possible changes in other assumptions would be
expected to lead to an impairment of the Denmark goodwill.

An impairment of the goodwill in Switzerland would have been recognised if the pre-tax discount rate
were increased by more than 80 basis points to at least 9.3%, or if the long-term growth rate were
decreased by more than 100 basis points to 0.6% or less. An impairment would also have been
recognised if revenue in the forecast period were to have been more than 2.6% lower than forecast,
with no corresponding fall in costs. No reasonably possible changes in other assumptions would be
expected to lead to an impairment of the Switzerland goodwill.

There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would result in an impairment to the
UK CGU in either the current or prior year.

###### 13 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

In the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, Software assets and associated
accumulated depreciation, if any, were transferred from property, plant and equipment to intangible
assets.

An impairment loss of £9,298,000 has been recognised for the year (2020: £6,898,000) which is
included within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The
below table sets out the amount of impairment loss recognised in each operating segment:


**2021**

**£’000**

United Kingdom **5,282** 2,997

Denmark **-** 3,901

Switzerland **4,016**  
Total impairment loss **9,298** 6,898

This impairment has been allocated proportionately across asset classes and relates to a small
number of gyms across the Group that have a value in use below the carrying amount of their nonfinancial assets. The values in use for the impaired CGUs of £31,152,000 (2020: £12,209,000) have
been determined to result in higher recoverable amounts than using fair value less costs of disposal
valuations. An impairment indicator was identified during the year for less profitable gyms which had
been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 lockdowns. The value in use of these gyms is based on
estimated cashflows forecast to be generated post 1 January 2022.

Discount rates and long-term growth rates applied in the value in use calculations are determined at a
country level, and are as disclosed in note 12. If revenue for those gyms identified as being at risk of
impairment were to be 3% below forecasted levels with no corresponding reduction in costs, an
additional impairment of £3,573,000 would have been recognised. If the discount rate applied in the
calculations were to be 100 basis points higher, an additional impairment of £1,495,000 would have
been recognised.

The recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets:

**27,459** 37,554

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all financial assets.

To measure the expected credit losses, financial assets have been grouped based on shared credit
risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on historical experience
of credit losses in the relevant geography.

On that basis, the loss allowance on trade and other receivables (excluding finance lease receivables)
as at 31 December 2021 is £268,000 (2020: £287,000) as all trade receivables and other debtors are
current and the expected loss rate for the Group as a whole is 2% (2020: 3%). Trade receivables
written off in the year totalled £nil (2020: £nil).

31 December 2021 are expected to be recognised in revenue during the next reporting period.

Contract liabilities – membership income has decreased by £20,415,000 between 31 December 2020
and 31 December 2021 as the balance returned to a more normal level following the re-opening of the
gyms and reduction in the number of frozen members compared to the position at 31 December 2020
when many of the Group’s gyms were closed due to COVID 19.

Current lease liabilities **85,013** 96,430

Non-current lease liabilities **490,010** 491,652

**575,023** 588,082

The Group’s leases primarily relate to its gym premises, as well as offices, equipment and vehicles.
Leases for properties are typically made for fixed periods of 10 to 20 years. Lease terms are negotiated
on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or
rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease
payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against
the right-of-use asset.

The total cash outflow for leases during the year was £98,175,000 (2020: £67,705,000).

During the year, the Group has applied the practical expedient to rent concessions as permitted in the
COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16. Included within administrative
expenses for the period is a credit of £17,828,000 (2020: £13,926,000) relating to Danish government
contributions towards rent received in the year and rent concessions agreed in the year.

###### 17 Lease liabilities (continued)

Included within note 13 are additions to right-of-use assets during the year, the depreciation charge
for right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets incurred during the year, and the carrying amount
of right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets at the end of the year.

A maturity of analysis of lease liabilities as at the end of the year is included in note 21.

8% and £106,445,000 (2020: £101,957,000) accrue interest at 4.375%. These amounts are repayable
on 30 November 2027. Also within amounts owed to Group undertakings is £359,000 (2020: £258,000)
which is interest free and repayable on demand.

**Financing**

At the start of the year, the Group had £430 million of Senior Secured Notes (“the Sterling Notes”) and
€445 million of Senior Secured Notes (“the Euro Notes”) in issue (together, “the Notes”). On 4 March
2021, a further €45 million of Euro Notes were issued on the same terms, taking the total Euro Notes
in issue to €490 million at the year end.


-----

###### 18 Borrowings (continued)

The Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange, for which Pinnacle Bidco PLC is the Issuer
and certain subsidiaries of the Group are guarantors. Interest on the Sterling Notes accrues at a rate
of 6.375% and interest on the Euro Notes accrues at a rate of 5.500% both payable at half-yearly
intervals. The Notes are due to be repaid in full on 15 February 2025.

On issue of the Euro Notes in 2020, these were recognised at fair value of €422,750,000 representing
a discount on issue of €22,250,000. The Euro Notes are subsequently held at amortised cost with
changes in the carrying amount recognised within finance cost as an unwind of discount on issue of
senior secured notes.

Capitalised issue costs are amortised over the period to the repayment date of the Notes.

In addition, the Group has a revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) with eight international institutions
(Barclays Bank PLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse
International, ING Bank N.V. Lloyds Bank plc and Danske Bank A/S, collectively "the Lenders"),
repayable 15 August 2024. Included within the total RCF is a £10 million overdraft facility. As at 31
December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the facility was undrawn.

Following amendments to the terms of the RCF on 18 September 2020, and further amendments on
7 January 2021, the Lenders granted a waiver of the pre-existing financial covenants on the RCF for
the remainder of the term. The financial covenant is replaced with a £30 million minimum liquidity test
on the last day of March, June, September and December each year.

The Group has been in compliance with all such covenants and tests during the current and previous
financial years.

During 2021, the Group obtained loan financing totalling £6,474,000 from the Danish government to
support the Danish business as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. The loan is interest free and the
outstanding balance is repayable in instalments between April 2022 and May 2023.

Foreign exchange movements **(353)** **(107)** **(460)**

**Carrying amount at 31 December 2021** **9,952**  - **9,952**

Dilapidations provisions relate to the requirement for the Group to restore leased premises to their
original condition at the end of the respective lease term. Other provisions related to future obligations
for other matters such as outstanding litigation. Outflows related to Dilapidations provisions are
expected to materialise over the next 2 to 25 years, depending on the length of the Group’s lease
terms. In estimating the timing of outflows, the Group has assumed that leases will be exited at the
end of the lease terms, but there is uncertainty over whether leases will be extended or exited early
which would alter the timing of the outflow.

_Defined pension benefits_

The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Switzerland, which pays benefits as per the
Federal Law on Occupational Benefits. The plan is organised as a contribution-based scheme as per
Article 15 of the Swiss Federal Law on Vesting in Pension Plans. Retirement benefits of active
participants accrue over a notional account as the sum of retirement credits (retirement credit rate
multiplied by pensionable salary) and interests. The Group mitigates the risks of a pension deficit by
insuring the liability with the pension foundation Allianz.

Set out below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all the financial instruments as
carried in the financial statements, other than lease liabilities and those for which the fair value
approximates closely with their carrying value. The fair value of senior secured notes is taken from the
quoted market price. This is a Level 1 valuation. The fair value of all other borrowings are calculated
by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a Level 2
valuation.

_Fair value hierarchy_

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects
the significance of the inputs used in the value measurements:

  - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets

  - Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted
prices in active markets; and

  - Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique.

There were no transfers between levels throughout the period under review.

###### 21 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk, credit
risk, and market risk arising from interest rate and foreign exchange risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s
objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has
overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.

**_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. The key market risks affecting the Group are interest rate risk
and foreign exchange rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain
borrowings and deposits. Financial instruments affected by exchange rate risk include the Euro Notes.
At 31 December 2021, the €490 million Euro Notes had a carrying amount of £397,022,000 based on
an amortised cost of €473,003,000 and an exchange rate of 0.839. At 31 December 2020, the Group
has €445 million Euro Notes with a carrying amount of £380,375,000 based on an amortised cost of
€423,274,000 and an exchange rate of 0.899. Had the exchange rate at 31 December 2021 been 10%
higher, then the Group’s loss for the year would have increased by £39,512,000. Foreign exchange
risk on the Group’s Euro Notes is partially mitigated through the cash flows and value of the Group’s
investments in subsidiaries denominated in Danish Krone. Danish Krone is pegged against the Euro.
The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the relative value of the Group’s Danish operations.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates.

As at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate
instruments by way of senior secured notes, amounts owed to group undertakings, and lease liabilities.
The Group has access to a £145m revolving credit facility with floating interest rates but was not drawn
down on this facility at the end of the period.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity
profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The
table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities and includes contractual
future interest payments:

**_Credit risk_**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade receivables. The Group’s
credit risk is low as it has limited trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because
the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number
of counterparties and customers. Quantitative data is included in the consolidated statement of
financial position and in note 16.

# Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC

## Report on the audit of the group financial statements

###### Opinion

In our opinion, Pinnacle Bidco PLC’s group financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of its profit and cash flows
for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and financial statements (the “Annual
Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020; the Consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the Consolidated statement of changes
in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant
accounting policies.

###### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.

###### Independence

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

###### Our audit approach

 Overview

Audit scope

- Our significant components were determined in relation to their contribution to the group's financial result or the
group's financial position.

- The group audit consisted of three significant components; Pinnacle Bidco PLC, Pure Gym Limited and Fitness
World A/S and specified audit procedures over contract liabilities - membership income and trade receivables in
Basefit.ch AG.

- In addition, centrally managed functions, including the group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the
group engagement team

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)

Key audit matters

- Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets

- Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment

- Risk of misstatement from lease accounting

- Risk of misstatement from acquisition accounting

- Risk of misstatement from consolidation

- Covid-19

Materiality

- Overall materiality: £3,850,000 (2019: £2,900,000) based on 2.5% of a 3-year average EBITDA of the proforma
Pinnacle Topco group from 2018 to 2020 (i.e. including Fitness World).

- Performance materiality: £2,887,500.

###### The scope of our audit

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial
statements.

###### Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect
material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of
detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws
and regulations related to compliance with relevant accounting standards, tax legislation and the criteria for claiming
under the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ('CJRS'), and we considered the extent to which noncompliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that
have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated
management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of
override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to the overstatement of assets, through overoptimistic assumptions underpinning the recoverable amounts of the relevant assets, the misclassification of items of
expenditure as exceptional, or items of exceptional income not as exceptional, or missing or incomplete disclosures.
The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include
appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group
engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- enquiring with management and those charged with governance to understand the relevant laws and regulations
applicable to the company, and their assessment of fraud related risks.

- identifying and testing journal entries using a risk-based targeting approach for unexpected account combinations or
unusual words or phrases in the journal description.

- obtaining management prepared value-in-use models to support the carrying value of non-current assets and
critically assessing the key assumptions, including long term growth rate, discount rate and capital expenditure.

- testing government grants, on a sample basis, to assess compliance with the criteria attached to the grants; and.

- reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation, where appropriate, to assess
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including testing the appropriate classification of items of income
and expenditure as exceptional or otherwise.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances
of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the
financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.


-----

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)

###### Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and
any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Risk of misstatement from acquisition accounting, Risk of misstatement from consolidation, and Covid-19 are new key
audit matters this year. Going Concern, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of its
inclusion as part the Covid-19 key audit matter. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|
|Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets The Group holds £846 million of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet at the year end (FY19: £515 million), which has increased significantly for FY20 due to the acquisition of the Fitness World group. Management is required to perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill, plus test for impairment of other intangible and tangible fixed assets where there are indicators of impairment, in line with IAS 36, using a discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) forecast of the principal cash generating units (‘CGUs’). We focused on this area because the determination as to whether or not goodwill is impaired involved subjective judgements and estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. We also considered the heightened risk as a result of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of the CGUs.|• We have understood management's process for budgeting and forecasting and have obtained management's CGU impairment model for each CGU. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non current assets being assessed for impairment to the balance sheet. • We challenged management's calculated discount rate used for discounting future cash flows within the impairment model, utilising PwC valuation specialists to assess the discount rate for each CGU. • We evaluated management's short term cash flow forecasts, obtaining industry reports to challenge management's assumptions, whilst also considering the impact of Covid-19 on the reopening and recovery of the business. • We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to quantify the downside changes needed to trigger an impairment, or to increase the impairment charges recognised. • We also assessed the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.|


-----

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)

|Key audit matter|How our audit addressed the key audit matter|
|---|---|
|Risk of impairment of right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment The Group holds a significant amount of right-of-use assets (‘RoU’) and other property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’) on the balance sheet, amounting to £717 million at the year end (FY19: £475 million). The challenging trading environment for the gym sector as a result of COVID-19 has meant that the possibility of impairment of RoU assets and other PPE remains a significant risk. The various restrictions and lockdowns in place at the financial year end represented an impairment trigger. As such, an impairment review is required to be carried out to assess the need for potential downwards adjustments to carrying values.|• We have understood management’s process for budgeting and forecasting and have obtained management's impairment model for each. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and agreed the carrying value of non current assets being assess for impairment to the balance sheet. • We challenged management's calculated discount rate used for discounting future cash flows within the impairment model, utilising PwC valuation specialists to assess the discount rate for each CGU. • We evaluated management's short term cash flow forecasts, obtaining industry reports to challenge management's assumptions, whilst also considering the impact of Covid-19 on the reopening and recovery of the business. • We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of the reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to quantify the downside changes to increase the impairment charges recognised. • We also assessed the disclosures made with respect to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.|
|Risk of misstatement from lease accounting The Group transitioned to accounting for leases under IFRS 16 for the first time in FY19. IFRS 16 lease accounting remains a significant risk for our audit for FY20 for two main reasons; • the acquisition of the Fitness World Group and required remeasurement of leases in accordance with both IFRS 16 and IFRS 3; and • to focus on the classification and presentation of the lease liability on the balance sheet given the impact of Covid-19 rent deferrals|• We have performed sample testing on the lease liability, right of use assets, interest and depreciation balances. This involved testing key inputs from lease agreements and recalculating the relevant balances on a sample basis. • We performed sample testing over rent deferrals to ensure the completeness of the closing lease liability. • We challenged management's assessment of the remaining lease life of the Danish gym estate, taking into account Danish law protections for lessees and their option to extend leases. • We involved our PwC Valuations specialists to assess the Danish Incremental Borrowing rate used to discount future lease payments on the initial recognition of the Danish leases on acquisition.|
|Risk of misstatement from acquisition accounting During January 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Forward Topco A/S (known as the Fitness World Group), for cash consideration of £233 million. The acquisition was material to the Group and involved management judgement and estimation in establishing the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, in particular intangible assets identified separately from goodwill.|• We have obtained management's report on the purchase price allocation and we engaged with our PwC valuations specialists to ensure the methodologies used when valuing intangible assets identified are reasonable and appropriate. • We have also assessed other inputs, such as growth rates and contributory asset charges for reasonableness. • We have used our valuations specialists to assess the discount rate used in the valuation model. • We tested the mathematical integrity of the valuation model.|

industry in which it operates.

We scoped the audit with three significant components. This included the two largest trading entities, which contribute
the majority of the trading results. We also included in our scope one holding company which has issued the group’s

Our assessment of the risk is focused on: • the resilience of the business to withstand the uncertainty and potential for future periods of lockdown; • narrative reporting in light of the significant impact of Covid-19; • accounting for government support schemes, and; • classification as ‘exceptional’ amounts arising as a result of Covid-19 This key audit matter contains our assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern which was a separate key audit matter in the prior period.|• We have obtained the Directors' assessment of the business as a going concern, covering the period to 30 April 2022. • We understood the cash forecasting process and tested the key assumptions for reasonableness. This included assessment of forecast cash flows, considering management's expectation of the speed and timing of the Group’s recovery from the 2021 global lockdowns and comparing those cash flows with existing liquidity and unused facilities and forecast compliance with banking covenants. • We have also performed additional sensitivity analyses to ascertain the impact of reasonably plausible changes in key assumptions that would result in a breach of the banking covenants or the group exceeding its available facilities. We have also assessed management's disclosures regarding their going concern assessment, banking facilities and sensitivity of the key estimates and judgements. • We have reviewed the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report to assess its consistency with the Group’s performance reported in the financial statements • We have obtained details of government support recognised as income and performed sample testing of inputs. • We have consulted with internal subject matter experts in assessing the Group’s compliance with government schemes. • We have obtained a listing of costs and income classified as exceptional and assessed against latest regulatory guidance.|

liabilities - membership income and trade receivables in Basefit.ch AG. In addition, centrally managed functions,
including the group consolidation, were audited at the head office by the group engagement team.

###### Materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

_Overall group_ £3,850,000 (2019: £2,900,000).
_materiality_

_How we_ 2.5% of a 3-year average EBITDA of the proforma Pinnacle Topco group from 2018 to 2020 (i.e.
_determined it_ including Fitness World)

_Rationale for_ EBITDA is a key financial performance measure used by management in monitoring the Group’s
_benchmark_ performance. The benchmark chosen takes into account two specific impacts in the current year;
_applied_ firstly we use an average measure from the past 3 years given that the Covid-19 pandemic has

significantly affected the performance measures in the current year; secondly we considered the
magnitude of the enlarged group as a result of the Fitness World acquisition.

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £3,450,000 and £1,750,000. Certain
components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected
and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining
the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and
disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality,
amounting to £2,887,500 for the group financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk
assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of
our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with those charged with governance that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit
above £192,500 (2019: £145,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for
qualitative reasons.

###### Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting included:

- Obtaining the Directors' Group level going concern assessment paper and cash flow forecasts to April 2022. We
tested the cash flow forecasts for mathematical accuracy;

- Assessing the group's banking facilities, associated banking covenant requirements in the going concern
assessment period and banking covenant waivers received prior to the year end;

- Challenging management on their contingency plans for potential future lockdowns, and the resilience of the
business to withstand additional periods of closure;

- Assessing the reasonableness of management's expectations for membership level recoveries upon the reopening
of the group's gym portfolio; and

- Performing multiple sensitivity analyses for plausible downside scenarios, to assess the group's liquidity position in
the review period and compliance with relevant banking covenants, should such downsides play out.

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the
group's ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.

###### Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency
or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement
of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain
opinions and matters as described below.

###### Strategic report and Directors' report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and
Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did
not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.

###### Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

 Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative
but to do so.

## Independent auditors’ report to the members of Pinnacle Bidco PLC (continued)

###### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data
auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing
complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics.
In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample
is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report. In our engagement letter, we
also agreed to describe our audit approach, including communicating key audit matters.

###### Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

## Other required reporting

###### Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

## Other matter

We have reported separately on the company financial statements of Pinnacle Bidco PLC for the year ended
31 December 2020.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

###### 1 General information

The principal activity of the Group during the year was the provision of facilities for physical fitness and
is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. Pinnacle Bidco PLC (“the Company”) and its
subsidiaries are limited by shares and are incorporated and domiciled in England. The address of the
Company’s registered office is Town Centre House, Merrion Centre, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS2 8LY.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance
with International Accounting Standards, in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006. The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as
modified for the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and
loss. The Group financial statements are presented in thousands of pounds sterling (“£’000”) except
when otherwise indicated. Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all financial periods
presented.

The preparation of the Group financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based
on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ
from those estimates.

**Basis of consolidation**

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2020. The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated
for the period from the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for using the
acquisition method. Uniform accounting policies are applied throughout the Group, unless otherwise
stated.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker, identified as the Executive Management Team of the Group. The Executive
Management Team primarily consider the business from a geographical perspective, by country of
operation. The Group’s operations consist solely of the provision of high quality health and fitness
facilities and associated services and consequently, it is not necessary to segregate operating
segments by service or product. The Executive Management Team use the measures of Revenue and
Adjusted EBITDA as key performance indicators in assessing the performance of the operating
segments. A definition of Adjusted EBITDA is included in note 6.

Following the acquisition of the Fitness World group in January 2020 (see note 30), the Group’s
material reportable segments are the United Kingdom and Denmark. The results from operations in all
other countries in which the Group operates are included in “All other segments”, as they are deemed
to be individually immaterial.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Going Concern**

In light of the on-going impact of Covid-19 on the performance of the Group the Directors have carefully
evaluated the Going Concern basis of preparation.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements, capex and funding of new sites through
its cash reserves and credit facilities, being an RCF facility of £145 million which includes an overdraft
of £10 million. As at 19 April 2021, the date of signing the financial statements, the Group’s forecasts
and projections (to 30 April 2022) taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance and potential future lockdowns, showed that the Group should be able to operate within
its existing facilities. This assessment included the impact of the 2021 national lockdowns, no
extension of Government support and the expectation of continued COVID-19 disruption on core
trading across 2021.

On an unmitigated basis the Group has a weekly cash burn of approximately £9.0 million per week,
including interest and tax. By factoring in known government mitigation measures across all territories
and management mitigation measures, total weekly cash burn (including interest and capex) has been
reduced to approximately £4.5 million. Government mitigations include payroll support, fixed cost
contributions and grants whilst management mitigations include reducing all unnecessary activity, tight
cost control and the delay of planned investments. The actions taken have been designed to protect
the medium and long term prospects of the business and, with available liquidity of £236 million (as at
31 December 2020) and the further raise of €45 million (c. £40 million) in March 2021, the Directors
consider that the Group has sufficient facilities to withstand over 14 months of full Group closure from
the start of 2021.

Based on these forecasts, and with no leverage or cash flow covenants until 2024, the Directors have
concluded there is no material uncertainty that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
remain a going concern for the foreseeable future and have therefore adopted the going concern basis
in preparing the Group’s financial statements.

**Revenue**

Revenue primarily represents sales of services provided in the period and non-refundable joining fees
received during the period, exclusive of value added tax. Member income includes membership
subscriptions and joining fee income. Membership subscriptions are received in advance of the period
to which they relate and are recognised as contract liabilities. The performance obligation attached to
membership subscriptions is satisfied over time, on a straight-line basis over the membership period
as this best represents the timing of services provided.

Where there are specific performance obligations attached to joining fees, then the income related to
this is recognised in the period in which membership commences since the performance obligation
attached to that income is satisfied in that period. Where there are no specific performance obligations
attached to joining fees, these are recognised over time, on a straight-line basis over the expected
duration of the membership.

Revenue from vending income and the sale of consumables is recognised at the point of sale. Other
income includes various ancillary revenue streams, which are recognised in the period to which they
relate.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Intangible assets**

_(a) Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to
each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the
Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

Goodwill is not amortised, instead impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU,
or group of CGUs, containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher
of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as
an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

_(b) Intangible assets acquired in business combinations_

The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the
date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement
utilising valuation expertise and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental
cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore,
management must estimate the expected useful life of intangible assets and charge amortisation on
these assets accordingly, the value of which is shown within administrative expenses. The useful life
estimated for assets acquired in business combinations varies based on the characteristics of the
particular asset, and are set out in note 12. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations
include customer relationships and brands. For the purpose of impairment testing, intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

_(c) Software_

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique
software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets where the following
criteria are met:

  - It is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

  - Management intends to complete the software and use it in the course of business

  - There is an ability to use the software

  - It can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

  - Adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the
software are available, and

  - The expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

Until the software is ready for use, capitalised development costs are presented within “Development
Projects in Progress” and are not amortised. Once the software is ready for use, the capitalised costs
are transferred into the “Software” category and amortised over a period of 3 to 5 years.

**Inventories**

Inventories primarily relate to goods for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Inventories are valued on a
first in, first out basis.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Property, plant and equipment**

All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost, including those costs that were directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition. Any capital contribution by a landlord towards
leasehold fitting out works is deducted from the cost of property, plant and equipment within that
leasehold. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less provisions for
depreciation and impairment.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset (less residual value) over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:

Right-of-use assets Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold costs Straight line over the life of the lease

Leasehold improvements Straight line over the shorter of 3-15 years or remaining lease life

Fixtures and fittings Straight line over 3-10 years

IT equipment Straight line over 3-5 years

Residual values are calculated where appropriate based on agreed buyback terms with suppliers.

**Leases as a lessee**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
More information on the determination of the lease term is included in note 3.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate using the interest rates from recent third party
funding, with adjustments appropriate for the lease term and security to make it specific to a particular
lease.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; and

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index
or rate as at the commencement date.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if the Group
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if
there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Leases as a lessee (continued)**

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss as ‘profit on lease modifications’ if the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Group presents right-of-use assets as part of ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities
as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.

A small number of property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales generated
from a particular gym. For certain gyms, up to 100% of lease payments are on the basis of variable
payment terms with a range of percentages as a proportion of sales. Variable lease payments that
depend on sales are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those
payments occurs.

**Leases as a lessor**

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance
lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the
case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment,
the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic
life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right- of-use
asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a shortterm lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease
as an operating lease.

**Financial instruments**

**_Financial liabilities_**

The Group initially recognises financial liabilities at fair value where applicable (net of any transaction
costs) and subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where the Group has borrowings, transaction costs are amortised using the effective interest method
over the life of the loan. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations
are discharged, cancelled, or expire. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised as finance
income or finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The Group sometimes uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge risks associated with interest rate movements or foreign
exchange. The Group initially recognises such instruments at fair value where applicable and
subsequently remeasures at each balance sheet date.

**_Financial assets_**

The Group classifies its financial assets as ‘those to be measured at amortised cost’ or ‘those to be
measured subsequently at fair value’. At initial recognition, the Group measures its financial assets at
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial
assets carried at FVPL are expensed in the profit or loss.


-----

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**_Financial assets (continued)_**

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other
receivables. These assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets
in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise,
on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.

**Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Impairment of financial assets**

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade
receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 36 months before
31 December and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The
historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready for use are not subject
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. This is deemed to occur when the cash generating unit to which the
asset belongs is performing below expectation. For property, plant and equipment this is generally
deemed to be when the CGU to which it belongs is loss making for more than three years after opening.

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of
disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). The Group’s CGUs
consist of either individual gyms or groups of gyms. Multiple gyms are combined to form a single CGU
when a significant number of members of a particular gym receive access to multiple gyms for a single
price.

Goodwill is assessed at the group of CGUs level in the case of the UK, where each gym represents a
CGU. Denmark and Switzerland are considered to be individual CGUs at the territory level. No CGU
or group of CGUs for goodwill monitoring purposes is at a level higher than an operating segment.

Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at
each reporting date.

Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where it is not possible to isolate cash flows
generated by a specific item of property, plant and equipment, impairment is tested at the CGU level,
representing a gym or group of gyms. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

###### 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

**Cash and cash equivalents**

In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is
due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting
period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

On certain of its leases, the Group is required to restore leased premises to their original condition at
the end of the respective lease term. Where it is deemed probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the restoration obligation, a provision is recognised for the present value of the
estimated expenditure required to remove leasehold improvements. The associated cost is capitalised
as part of the leasehold improvements and amortised over the shorter of the lease term or the useful
life of the assets.

**Government grants**

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and recognised in the
same line item in the statement of comprehensive income.

**Taxation**

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.

Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

**Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so
to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are non-recurring
material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their
nature or amount. Examples of items included within exceptional items are restructuring and
transformational costs, and costs relating to acquisitions or certain expansion projects. Management
consider, on a case by case basis, whether costs are exceptional based on the specific circumstances.

**New and amended standards**

The Group has elected to adopt the following standard amendment early:

- Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions – amendments to IFRS 16

The amendment listed above impacted the current year financial statements and is expected to impact
the standards in future years. No other new or amended accounting standards had an impact on the
financial statements in the current year.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and judgements
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.

**Estimates**

_Fair values of intangible assets acquired in business combinations_

The Group has made estimates of the fair value of customer relationships and brands acquired on
acquisition of the Fitness World group on 14 January 2020. Customer relationships were valued using
an excess earnings approach based on management’s forecasts and applying an estimated attrition
rate of existing customers of between 35% and 37%. An increase in the attrition rate by 500 bps would
decrease the valuation of customer relationships at acquisition by £9.1m. Brands were valued using a
relief from royalty approach based on management’s forecasts and applying a royalty rate of 2%. A
decrease in the royalty rate by 100 bps would decrease the valuation of the brands at the acquisition
date by £16.1m. Further details of the fair values recognised on business combinations are included
in note 30.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

_Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based
on the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). The Group also assesses whether
any events have occurred which would trigger an impairment review of non-financial assets with finite
useful lives such as intangible assets other than goodwill and property, plant and equipment, including
the expected impact of COVID-19 on the short to medium term profitability of each CGU. Where this
is the case, the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs being assessed is determined
based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows
and the determination of a pre-tax discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash
flows. Management also consider whether reasonably possible changes in key assumptions may
cause an impairment of the non-financial assets. A summary of the key assumptions used, and the
possibility of impairment, should reasonably possible changes in those key assumptions occur, is
included in note 12.

_Provisions for leasehold dilapidations_

Provisions are made for dilapidations of leasehold improvements in leased properties. Management
make estimates of the amount and timing of future payments in relation to the restoration of leased
properties based on contractual obligations, historic experience and the views of experts. Where it is
assessed that the likelihood of an outflow of resources to settle a restoration obligation on leased
premises is probable, a provision is made for the expected future outflow, discounted to present value
using a discount rate of between 0.5% and 2% to reflect the time value of money.

As at 31 December 2020, management have determined that a provision is required for 213 out of its
492 leased premises. Details of the provision recorded are included in note 19. If the future cost of
restoration for a site where a provision has been recorded were to increase by 10%, the provision at
31 December 2020 would increase by £1,002,000.

_Incremental borrowing rate for discounting of lease liabilities_

The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments in the calculation of lease
liabilities. The use of this method requires estimates of interest rates which would be available to the
Group if it were to borrow funds, over a similar term and with a similar security, necessary to obtain an
asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Management utilise
internal and external information to determine an appropriate rate. This includes evidence arising from
the Group’s recent third party borrowings, publicly available borrowing rates for companies with similar
characteristics to the Group, and risk-free interest rates applicable in the relevant geographies in which
the Group operates. IBRs applied to leases across the Group range from 4.9% to 9.5%. Details of the
lease liabilities recognised are included in note 17.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_

The Group recognises deferred tax assets only if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there
will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be
deducted.

Management makes an estimate of the future taxable profits of the Group and compares this to the
available losses, taking into account applicable tax laws in the relevant geographies. Estimation
uncertainty increases in later years of the forecast period due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting
future profits. Detail of the tax charge and deferred tax asset are set out in note 11.

###### 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

**Judgements**

_Lease terms on leased properties_

The Group recognises leased properties in accordance with IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The lease term is
determined as the non-cancellable period of each lease, together with periods covered by an option
to extend the lease if management are reasonably certain to exercise that option. Certain of the
Group’s leases include clauses which allow the Group to unilaterally extend the lease on a rolling
basis. Management exercise significant judgement in determining the period over which they are
reasonably certain that they will continue to extend such leases. In making this assessment on a leaseby-lease basis, management consider the following factors:

     - The prevailing market conditions relative to the contractual lease terms

     - Significant leasehold improvements undertaken that are expected to have a significant
economic benefit for the Group

     - Costs relating to the termination of the lease

     - The importance of the gym to the Group’s operations; and

     - The Group’s past practice on extending leases beyond their contractual terms.

At 31 December 2020, for gyms which include such clauses the average difference between lease
term and contractual term is one year.

###### 4 Operating segments

Following the acquisition of Fitness World group in January 2020, the group’s material reportable
segments in the current period are the United Kingdom and Denmark. The results from operations in
all other countries in which the Group operates are included in “All other segments”. Segmental
information presented to the Executive Management Team for the year is presented in the below table:

**2020**

**Revenue** **142,405** **103,232** **24,304** **269,941** **3,352** **273,293**

**Adjusted EBITDA** **7,361** **4,083** **(40)** **11,404** **(478)** **10,926**

Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019 of £254,940,000 and
£89,084,000 respectively relates wholly to the United Kingdom.

All operating segments derive revenue from all of the services and products included within note 5. All
revenue included in the table above derives from external customers.

Adjusted EBITDA is derived by adjusting operating profit for depreciation, amortisation, profit/loss on
disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, impairment of property,
plant and equipment, exceptional costs, share based payment charges, pre-opening costs and the
cash rent adjustment. The cash rent adjustment includes an add-back of any property rent-related
expenses charged in the statement of comprehensive income and a deduction of contractual property
rent payments due in the period (whether or not paid in cash in the period).

The Adjusted EBITDA KPI is typically used within the industry as it is more effective than operating
profit in representing the results of the Group’s trade and, as such, is a key focus of our stakeholders,
including our investors, our bondholders and our banking partners. A reconciliation from operating
profit to Adjusted EBITDA is included in note 6.

###### 5 Revenue

Revenue is analysed by service or product as follows:

**2020**

**£’000**


2019

£’000


Member income **244,071** 235,607

Vending and consumables income **14,402** 7,328

Other income **11,468** 12,005

**269,941** 254,940

The Fitness World group was acquired on 14 January 2020 (see note 30) and, as a result, reported
revenue would ordinarily have been expected to increase significantly compared to the prior period.
However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has been forced to close some or all of
its gyms across the estate at varying times throughout the current year and this has caused a
significant reduction in revenue for the enlarged group during the closure period. All gyms in the estate
initially closed between 12 and 21 March 2020. By the end of August 2020 all gyms across the estate
had re-opened, but a resurgence of COVID-19 infections across Europe in the autumn and winter led
to further localised and national lockdowns with associated gym closures.

For members in the United Kingdom and Denmark, during the closure periods, all memberships were
automatically frozen meaning that no payments for gym subscriptions were taken from members
during this time.

In Switzerland, our Basefit business operates a subscription model. Under this model, amounts paid
by members in advance for any closure period were deferred such that revenue for gym subscriptions
was only recognised when gyms were open. Where membership renewals fell within the closure
period, payment was taken from members as usual, but an extended membership term provided to
cover the closure periods.

The majority of member income is recognised over time to reflect the period over which the member
receives the services provided. Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time.
Other income includes revenue from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over
which the personal trainer is operating, and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training
services which are both recognised at a point in time.

_3 Under IFRS 16, most lease costs are excluded from Group Reported EBITDA. To produce a comparable and more_
_relevant EBITDA figure, the contractual property rent payments due during the accounting period are deducted and any_
_property rent-related expenses included in Group Reported EBITDA are added back. Management believes that_
_adjusting EBITDA to reflect cash rent is a better reflection of actual earnings._

###### 7 Exceptional administrative expenses (continued)

Costs relating to acquisitions represent the costs associated with the acquisition of the Fitness World
group by PureGym, which completed on 14 January 2020 (see note 30).

Integration, transition and restructuring costs include the costs associated with the integration of
Fitness World into the Group and major internal restructuring projects. It includes £2,257,000 relating
to a programme aimed at optimising the Danish estate and operating model and maximising
profitability of the Fitness World group. A more efficient structure was implemented, which impacted
328 employees but improved member experience through a more skilled and smaller group of
managers and by centralising functions at the head office.

One-off costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic were incurred either in the process of closing gyms
during the pandemic or in the preparation for and reopening of the gyms in line with government
guidance. These costs include one-off deep cleans of gyms at the end of the closure period, fees for
consultants engaged to provide advice on safe operation, and reviews of ventilation in gyms to ensure
that they comply with our COVID-19 TrainSafe protocols.

On 3 November 2020, the landlord of one site exercised their lease break option and agreed settlement
consideration of £10,950,000. The settlement was paid at the break date of the lease on 8 March 2021.
The settlement is being recognised on a straight line basis over the period from the activation of the
break clause to the break date of the lease.

Exploration of acquisition and expansion opportunities relates to cost incurred in exploring
opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, organic expansion or diversification. The directors remain
focussed on the success of the existing business in the Group’s core geographies while being open to
opportunities which would contribute to and complement that success.

All projects ongoing at 31 December 2020 are expected to complete in 2021.

**80,121** 34,598

In reaction to the gym closures required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Group
took advantage of available government support schemes in each of its geographies, including
contributions towards wages and salaries of £16,422,000 in the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019:
£nil). Grants received have been netted off the related costs in the statement of comprehensive
income.

The Group operates multiple defined contribution pension schemes for all employees using master
trust (occupational trust-based) pension schemes. The total cost expensed in the year was £3,039,000
(2019: £834,000) and outstanding pension contributions at the year-end were £418,000 (31 December
2019: £nil).

The Directors and certain employees hold ordinary A1 and A2 shares in the Company, which have
service and vesting conditions attached and are therefore in the scope of IFRS 2 'Share based
payments'. The directors have applied a valuation model to calculate a grant date fair value of these
shares for IFRS 2 purposes as £2.39 per share. Consequently, a charge of £357,000 has been
recognised during the year (2019: £306,000) and is included within wages and salaries.

The average monthly number of persons (including directors) employed by the Group during the period
was made up as follows:

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK was 19% throughout the year (2019: 19%) and
accordingly the Group’s profits for this period are taxed at this rate. Deferred tax has been measured
at 19% (2019: 17%) in these financial statements as that is the rate at which the timing differences are
expected to reverse.

In the March 2021 UK Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an increase in the UK
standard rate of corporation tax to 25% from 1 April 2023. The legislation was not enacted during the
year ended 31 December 2020, so deferred tax has been provided using the enacted rate of 19%. If
deferred tax was calculated using the 25% rate the net deferred tax liability recognised at the balance
sheet date would be increased from £6,503,000 to £8,557,000.

been recognised as the directors are of the opinion that it is unlikely that suitable taxable profits will
arise in those entities in the foreseeable future.

Development Projects in Progress and Software consist of capitalised development costs, being an
internally generated intangible asset. In the year ended 31 December 2020, Software assets and
associated accumulated depreciation were transferred from property, plant and equipment to
intangible assets.

The Group continues to invest in technology to evolve and improve the quality of its product offering
to members and to optimise the efficiency of its operating model. During the year ended 31 December
2020, the business concluded on its choice of technology infrastructure for the newly combined group.
This convergence decision resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge in relation to Fitness
World’s existing Development Projects in Progress and Software totalling £11,542,000 (2019: £nil).

Brands encompass the PureGym, Fitness World, and Basefit brands acquired as part of business
combinations and valued at fair value at the date of acquisition. The remaining amortisation periods of
the brands are:

PureGym: 17 years

Fitness World: 19 years

Basefit: 9 years

Customer Relationships represent the fair value of customer relationships held in Denmark and
Switzerland at the time of the acquisition of the Fitness World group in January 2020. These assets
have a useful life of 5 years and a remaining amortisation period of 4 years.

Goodwill is not amortised, but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment with reference to the
group of cash generating units (CGUs) to which it relates. Customer Relationships and Brands are
allocated to the group of CGUs to which they relate and tested for impairment at the CGU or group of
CGUs level (in the case of the UK) as these assets do not generate cash flows that are largely
independent from other assets in each CGU or group of CGUs. The recoverable amount of a cash
generating unit (CGU) has been determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use
of assumptions. These have been determined to result in a higher recoverable amount for the CGU
than a fair value less costs of disposal valuation. Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections
based on financial budgets approved by management covering a four-year period.

The Group acquired the Fitness World group on 14 January 2020 (see note 30) recognising goodwill
on acquisition of £239,134,000 in relation to the operations in Denmark and Switzerland. The
subsequent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations across all of the Group’s geographies
limited the ability of the businesses to generate the expected revenues during 2020 and is expected
to continue to have an impact going forward as a result of the lockdowns imposed across Europe in
the first few months of 2021. While management expect the value of these businesses to recover to
their pre-pandemic levels in due course, an impairment has been recognised in 2020 to reflect this
expected short-term impact on cash flows totalling £6,622,000 and £6,327,000 in Denmark and
Switzerland respectively.

The below table sets out key assumptions applied in the value-in-use calculations for each significant
group of CGUs.

**UK** **Denmark** **Switzerland**

Annual capital expenditure on existing estate from 2022 (£m) 24 9 3

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 12 Intangible assets (continued)

Average annual capital expenditure is determined based on historical experience of management and
current plans for site refurbishments. The amount included in the table above relates to capital
expenditure from 2022 onwards, as capital expenditure in 2021 is distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic
and is not a key assumption. The pre-tax discount rates reflect specific risks relating to the Group and
the markets in which it operates. The long-term growth rates are determined based on a combination
of industry and country-level forecasts.

If the long-term growth rate in Denmark and Switzerland is 10 basis points lower than management’s
estimate (at 1.7% and 1.0% respectively), the Group would have to recognise an additional impairment
against the goodwill associated with those CGUs of £2.7m and £1.1m respectively.

If the pre-tax discount rate in Denmark and Switzerland had been 10 basis points higher than
management’s estimate (at 10.1% and 9.0%), the Group would have to recognise an additional
impairment against the goodwill associated with those CGUs of £4.2m and £1.4m respectively.

If the current COVID-19 related lockdowns in Denmark and Switzerland were to be extended by 1
month to 4 months, the Group would have to recognise an additional impairment against the goodwill
associated with those CGUs of £3.7m and £1.5m respectively.

There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would result in an impairment to the
UK CGU in either the current or prior year.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 13 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

In the year ended 31 December 2020, Software assets and associated accumulated depreciation were
transferred from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.

An impairment loss of £6,898,000 has been recognised for the year (2019: £331,000) which is included
within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Of this,
£3,901,000 has been recognised in relation to gyms in Denmark which have been closed as part of
the Group’s strategy to optimise the Danish estate following the acquisition of Fitness World by the
Group in January 2020.

A further £2,997,000, which has been allocated proportionately across asset classes, relates to a small
number of gyms in the United Kingdom that have a potential value in use below the carrying amount
of their non-financial assets. A value in use valuation has been determined to result in a higher
recoverable amount for the CGU than a fair value less costs of disposal valuation. An impairment
indicator was identified during the year for less profitable gyms which had been impacted significantly
by the COVID-19 lockdowns. The value in use of these gyms is based on estimated cashflows forecast
to be generated post 1 January 2021. Forecast cashflows are significantly impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic during this period due to the closure of gyms in the United Kingdom throughout winter of
2020/2021 and the short-term impact of this on profitability in the proceeding months is expected to
impact cash flows temporarily while the business builds back to pre-pandemic levels. Management
expect that the value in use of these gyms will increase in future periods following the re-opening
phase.

Had the discount rate used in the value in use calculations for the United Kingdom gyms been 1%
higher than that used, the impairment recognised would have increased by £840,000. No reasonably
possible changes in other assumptions would result in a material change to the recognised impairment
charge.

**37,554** 21,923

The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit
risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles
of sales over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2020 and the corresponding historical credit
losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and
forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle
the receivables. The Group has identified the GDP and the unemployment rate of the countries in
which it sells its services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss
rates based on expected changes in these factors.

On that basis, the loss allowance on trade receivables and other debtors as at 31 December 2020 is
£287,000 (2019: £nil) as all trade receivables and other debtors are current and the expected loss rate
for the Group is 3% (2019: 0%). Trade receivables written off in the year totalled £nil (2019: £nil).

Current lease liabilities **96,430** 21,621

Non-current lease liabilities **491,652** 315,343

The Group’s leases primarily relate to its gym premises, as well as offices, equipment and vehicles.
Leases for properties are typically made for fixed periods of 10 to 20 years. Lease terms are negotiated
on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or
rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease
payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against
the right-of-use asset.

The total cash outflow for leases during the year was £67,705,000 (2019: £41,765,000).

During the year, the Group has applied the practical expedient to rent concessions as permitted in the
COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16. Included within administrative
expenses for the period is a credit of £13,926,000 relating to Danish government contributions towards
rent received in the year and rent concessions agreed in the year.

Included within note 13 are additions to right-of-use assets during the year, the depreciation charge
for right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets incurred during the year, and the carrying amount
of right-of-use assets by class of underlying assets at the end of the year.

A maturity of analysis of lease liabilities as at the end of the year is included in note 21.

Of the amounts owed to Group undertakings, £369,166,000 (2019: £340,904,000) accrue interest at
8% and £101,957,000 (2019: £nil) accrue interest at 4.375%. All amounts owed to Group undertakings
are repayable on 30 November 2027.

**Financing**

The Group has £430 million of Senior Secured Notes (“the Sterling Notes”) and €445 million of Senior
Secured Notes (“the Euro Notes”) in issue as at the period end (together, “the Notes”). The Notes are
listed on The International Stock Exchange, for which Pinnacle Bidco plc is the Issuer and certain
subsidiaries of the Group are guarantors. Interest on the Sterling Notes accrues at a rate of 6.375%,
payable half yearly in February and August and interest on the Euro Notes accrues at a rate of 5.500%,
payable half yearly in May and November. The Notes are due to be repaid in full on 15 February 2025.

On 14 January 2020, the Group acquired Fitness World for a consideration of DKK 2,037,110,000
(£233 million) and the acquisition was funded with a €445 million (£381 million) Senior Secured bridge
facility (the “Bridge Facility”), which was also used to repay pre-existing Fitness World debt of DKK
1,029,797,000 (£117,963,000). On 17 November 2020, the Bridge Facility was refinanced with the
Euro Notes.

The Euro Notes were recognised at fair value of €422,750,000 on the date of issue, representing a
discount on issue of the Euro Notes of €22,250,000. The difference between the carrying value of the
Bridge Facility and the fair value of the Euro Notes has been recognised as a gain within finance costs
in the statement of comprehensive income. The Euro Notes are subsequently held at amortised cost
with changes in the carrying amount recognised within finance cost as an unwind of discount on issue
of senior secured notes.

Capitalised issue costs are amortised over the period to the repayment date of the Notes.

In addition, the Group has a revolving credit facility (the “RCF Facility”) with eight international
institutions (Barclays Bank PLC, Jefferies Finance LLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse AG,
Credit Suisse International, ING Bank N.V. Lloyds Bank plc and Danske Bank A/S, collectively "the
Lenders").

On 14 January 2020, the terms of the RCF Facility were amended to increase the facility from £60
million to £95 million and this was increased further to £145 million on 18 September 2020. Included
within the total RCF Facility is a £10 million overdraft facility. In addition, the repayment date of the
RCF Facility was extended during the year from 30 November 2023 to 15 August 2024. During the
year ended 31 December 2020, drawings were made on the facility to a total level of £135 million. As
at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the facility was undrawn.

The Notes and the RCF Facility are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets and
undertakings of certain subsidiaries of the Group. Until 18 September 2020, the RCF Facility was
subject to a financial covenant of net leverage ratio lower than or equal to 7.7 when amounts drawn
down on the facility were greater than 40% at the testing date (being the last day of March, June,
September and December each year). Following amendments to the terms of the RCF Facility on 18
September 2020, and further amendments on 7 January 2021, the Lenders granted a waiver of the
pre-existing financial covenants on the facility for the remainder of the term. The financial covenant is
replaced with a £30 million minimum liquidity test on the last day of March, June, September and
December each year.

The Group has been in compliance with all such covenants and tests during the current and previous
financial years.

Set out below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all the financial instruments as
carried in the financial statements, other than finance leases, lease liabilities and those for which the
fair value approximates closely with their carrying value. The fair value of senior secured notes is taken
from the quoted market price. This is a Level 1 valuation. The fair value of all other borrowings are
calculated by discounting the future cash flows at prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a
Level 2 valuation.

_Fair value hierarchy_

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects
the significance of the inputs used in the value measurements:

  - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets

  - Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted
prices in active markets; and

  - Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique.

There were no transfers between levels throughout the period under review.

###### 21 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk, credit
risk, and market risk arising from interest rate risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s
objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has
overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.

**_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. The key market risks affecting the Group are interest rate risk
and foreign exchange rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain
borrowings and deposits. Financial instruments affected by exchange rate risk include the Euro Notes.
At 31 December 2020, the €445 million Euro Notes had a carrying amount of £380,375,000 based on
an amortised cost of €423,274,000 and an exchange rate of 0.899.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. During the period, the Group’s exposure to the risk of
changes in market interest rates related primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest
rates.

As at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate
instruments by way of senior secured loan notes, preference shares and finance leases. The Group
has access to a £145m revolving credit facility with floating interest rates but was not drawn down on
this facility at the end of the period.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity
profiles of financial assets and operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves. The
table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities and includes contractual
future interest payments:

_restated to include future interest payments. No adjustment has been made to the carrying amount of financial liabilities._

**_Credit risk_**

The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade receivables. The Group’s
credit risk is low as it has limited trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because
the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number
of counterparties and customers. Quantitative data is included in the consolidated statement of
financial position and in note 16.

###### 30 Business combinations

On 14 January 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Forward Topco A/S
(known, together with its subsidiaries, as “the Fitness World group”) for DKK 2,037,110,000
(£233,350,000). The principal activity of the Fitness World group is the provision of physical fitness
facilities in Denmark and Switzerland.

The goodwill of £239,134,000 arising from the acquisition is attributable to the acquired workforce, and
anticipated future earnings from future new customers. None of the goodwill recognised is expected
to be deductible for income tax purposes.

World group was £4,625,000.

Had the Fitness World group been consolidated from 1 January 2020 then the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income would include revenue of £134,661,000, loss for the period from continuing
operations of £74,152,000 and loss from discontinued operations of £4,628,000.

Comprehensive Income for the year were a credit of £40,000, and acquisition-related costs of
£4,507,000 were charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the year ended 31 December 2019.

**Acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2019**

In the prior year, the Group made trade and asset acquisitions of existing gym businesses. The gyms
were acquired for the purpose of expanding the PureGym property portfolio, and increasing the
Group’s presence in the relevant local markets. All gyms acquired were closed for refurbishment
following acquisition to be reopened under the PureGym model and branding.

The following table sets out the consideration paid and fair value of assets acquired for the gyms:

###### 32 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 4 March 2021, the Group issued an additional €45 million of Euro Notes on the same terms as the
existing Euro Notes, bringing the total repayment value of Euro Notes in issue to €490 million. The
proceeds are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, providing additional liquidity to
protect against any further lockdowns initially, and facilitating a return to growth when the timing is
right.

At the date of signing these financial statements, the Group continues to be impacted by the COVID19 crisis. At 31 December 2020, all gyms in Denmark and Switzerland, and most UK gyms, were
closed as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, with the remaining 42 UK gyms forced to close on 4
January 2021.

Subsequently, the Group re-opened 240 of its English gyms on 12 April 2021 (including 10 new sites),
and all gyms in Switzerland re-opened on 19 April 2021. In all of the Group’s other geographies the
COVID-19 situation is improving as at the date of signing these financial statements and all remaining
gyms are expected to have re-opened by mid-May 2021.

##### Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements

###### 1 General information

Pinnacle Bidco plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and is a public
limited company. The address of the company’s registered office is C/O Pure Gym Limited, Town Centre House,
Merrion Centre, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS2 8LY, United Kingdom. The condensed financial statements are
unaudited and were approved by the Board of Directors on 23 August 2023.

This financial information for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023, including comparative financial information for the
months ended 30 June 2022, has been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out in the last annual
report and accounts and in accordance with UK adopted IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board. This report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in
an annual financial report and accordingly should be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended
31 December 2022.

In preparing the condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in
applying the group’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same, in all material
respects, as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

**Going concern assumption**

The Directors have carefully evaluated the Going Concern basis of the Group. In doing so, they have taken account
of the impact of the inflationary environment and cost-of-living pressures affecting the countries in which the Group
operates at the time of issuing these financial statements.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements, capex and funding of new sites through its cash
reserves and credit facilities, being a revolving credit facility (“RCF”) of £145 million which includes an overdraft of
£10 million. Both the RCF and the Group’s senior secured notes (as described in note 10) have a maturity date in
February 2025, beyond the going concern assessment period.

The Group is currently considering the refinancing of its borrowing facilities including the RCF and senior secured
notes. In preparing this Going Concern assessment, an assumption has been made that a refinancing is completed
on 1 January 2024 on terms based on expected market conditions. The assessment below uses this assumption
throughout. If a refinancing were not to be completed during the period to 31 December 2024, liquidity headroom
would be increased as forecast interest costs would be lower.

As at the date of issue of these financial statements, the Group’s forecasts and projections (to 31 December 2024)
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance showed that the Group should be able to
operate within its existing facilities.

This assessment included consideration of severe but plausible downside scenarios including one combining a 10%
fall in forecast revenue, and a 10% inflationary uplift in costs (other than for utilities costs, for which the Group has
largely fixed its costs throughout the forecast period).

The Group had cash reserves at 30 June 2023 of £180 million, as well as a further £31 million available cash in the
parent company, Pinnacle Topco Limited. Combining these with the available RCF gives a total liquidity position of
£356 million at 30 June 2023. Under the severe but plausible downside scenarios modelled, the Group would
maintain a minimum liquidity of £127 million for the entire forecast period to December 2024.

As described in note 10, there is a financial covenant waiver on the RCF which remains in effect until 15 August
2024. After this date, the RCF will be subject to a financial covenant where the net leverage ratio must be less than
or equal to 7.7x when amounts drawn down on the facility are greater than 40%. Under the severe but plausible

**Pinnacle Bidco PLC**
**Annual report and consolidated financial statements 2021**

##### Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
downside scenarios modelled, the Group would not breach the covenants on the RCF for the period to December
2024.

**Pinnacle Bidco PLC**
**Annual report and consolidated financial statements 2021**

##### Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (continued)

###### 1 General Information (continued)

Based on this review, the Directors have concluded that the Group has adequate resources to continue to remain a
going concern for the foreseeable future and have therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing its financial
statements.

**Information extracted from 2022 Annual Report**

The financial figures for the year ended 31 December 2022, as set out in this report, do not constitute statutory
accounts but are derived from the statutory accounts for that financial year.

The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 were prepared under IFRS and have been delivered
to the Registrar of Companies. They are available to download from corporate.puregym.com. The audit report was
unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not include a statement under Section
498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.

###### 2 Operating segments

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating
decision-maker, identified as the Executive Management Team of the Group. The Executive Management Team
primarily consider the business from a geographical perspective, by country of operation. The Group’s operations
consist solely of the provision of high quality health and fitness facilities and associated services and consequently,
it is not necessary to segregate operating segments by service or product. The Executive Management Team use
the measures of Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA as key performance indicators in assessing the performance of the
operating segments. A definition of Adjusted EBITDA is included below.

The Group’s material reportable segments as at 30 June 2023, are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Switzerland.
The results from other segments in which the Group operates (US and Franchising) are included in “All other
segments”, as they are deemed to be individually immaterial.

Segmental information presented to the Executive Management Team for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023 is
presented in the below tables, alongside comparative information:

Adjusted EBITDA 40.6 10.2 - (1.4) 49.4

All operating segments derive revenue from all of the services and products included within note 3. All revenue
included in the table above derives from external customers.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure derived by adjusting operating profit for depreciation, amortisation,
profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit/loss on lease modifications, impairment of property,

##### Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (continued)

plant and equipment, exceptional costs, share based payment charges, pre opening costs, other adjustments and
the cash rent adjustment.

###### 2 Operating segments (continued)

The cash rent adjustment includes an add back of any property rent related expenses charged in the statement of
comprehensive income (including rent-free concessions agreed) and a deduction of contractual property rent
payments due in the period (whether or not paid in cash in the period). Adjusted EBITDA is stated before rent
deferments which relate to property rent deferments agreed with landlords due to COVID-19 gym closures.

The Adjusted EBITDA KPI is typically used within the industry as it is more effective than operating profit in
representing the performance of the business and, as such, is a key focus of our stakeholders, including our
investors, our bondholders and our banking partners. A reconciliation from operating profit to Adjusted EBITDA is
included in note 4.

###### 3 Revenue

Revenue is analysed below segregated by service or product.

Member income **242.1** 207.0

Vending and consumables income **13.0** 11.5

Other revenue **16.5** 14.3

**271.6** 232.8

The Group experiences a small degree of seasonality. The majority of members join in January, February and March,
and joiner rates also increase in September and October. Seasonality is generally positively driven by consumers'
desire to improve their fitness at the start of the year and the start of new university and school terms and is negatively
driven by Christmas and summer holidays. Marketing expenditure is generally focused around peak joining periods,
particularly the January/February period.

The majority of member income is recognised over time to reflect the period over which the member receives the
services provided. Vending and consumables income is recognised at a point in time. Other revenue includes
revenue from personal trainers, recognised over time to reflect the period over which the personal trainer is operating,
and sales of day passes to non-members and personal training services which are both recognised at a point in time.

Danish estate from Fitness World to PureGym. As a result, an impairment of £23.3m was recognised to fully write
down the Fitness World brand.

An impairment loss of £2.3m has been recognised for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (31 December
2022: £21.4m) which is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. Of the impairment loss, £1.0m relates to the Denmark operating segment and
£1.3m relates to the United Kingdom operating segment.

This impairment has been allocated proportionately across asset classes and relates to a small number
of gyms across the Group that have a value in use below the carrying amount of their non-financial
assets. The values in use for the impaired CGUs of £3.5m have been determined to result in higher
recoverable amounts than using fair value less costs of disposal valuations. An impairment indicator was
identified during the period for gyms which had underperformed against expectations. The value in use
of the impaired gyms is based on estimated cashflows forecast to be generated post 30 June 2023.

Discount rates and long-term growth rates applied in the value in use calculations are determined at a
country level. If operating cash flows for the gyms reviewed for impairment were to be 5% below
forecasted levels, an additional impairment of £0.6m would have been recognised. If the discount rate
applied in the calculations were to be 50 basis points higher, an additional impairment of £0.1m would
have been recognised.

Amounts owed to Group undertakings relate to the parent company, Pinnacle Midco 2 Limited. Of the amounts owed
to Group undertakings £450.2m (31 December 2022: £432.7m) accrue interest at 8% and £113.5m (31 December
2022: £111.1m) accrue interest at 4.375%. These amounts are repayable on 30 November 2027.

**Financing**

The Group has £430 million of Senior Secured Notes (“the Sterling Notes”) and €490 million of Senior Secured Notes
(“the Euro Notes”) in issue (together, “the Notes”).

The Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange, for which Pinnacle Bidco plc is the Issuer and certain
subsidiaries of the Group are guarantors. Interest on the Sterling Notes accrues at a rate of 6.375% and interest on
the Euro Notes accrues at a rate of 5.500% both payable at half-yearly intervals. The Notes are due to be repaid in
full on 15 February 2025.

On issue of the Euro Notes in 2020, these were recognised at fair value of €422.8 million representing a discount on
issue of €22.3 million. The Euro Notes are subsequently held at amortised cost with changes in the carrying amount
recognised within finance cost as an unwind of discount on issue of senior secured notes.

Capitalised issue costs are amortised over the period to the repayment date of the Notes.

In addition, the Group has a revolving credit facility (“RCF”) with seven international institutions ("the Lenders"),
secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets and undertakings of Pinnacle Bidco plc and certain of its
subsidiaries. The term of the RCF was recently extended by 5 months from 15 August 2024 to 15 January 2025 (the
“Extension period”). Included within the total RCF is a £10 million overdraft facility. As at 30 June 2023 and 31
December 2022, the facility was undrawn.

Following amendments to the terms of the RCF in 2021, the Lenders granted a financial covenant waiver which
remains in effect until 15 August 2024. During this period, the financial covenant is replaced with a £30 million
minimum liquidity test on the last day of March, June, September and December each year. During the subsequent
Extension period, the RCF will be subject to a financial covenant where the net leverage ratio must be less than or
equal to 7.7x when amounts drawn down on the facility are greater than 40%. The Group has been in compliance
with all such covenants and tests during the current and previous financial periods.

_Fair value hierarchy_

IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance
of the inputs used in the value measurements:

  - Level 1: inputs are quoted prices in active markets

  - Level 2: a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active
markets; and

  - Level 3: a valuation using unobservable inputs i.e. a valuation technique. There are no Level 3 valuations.

Set out below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all the financial instruments as carried in the
financial statements, other than finance leases, lease liabilities and those for which the fair value approximates
closely with their carrying value. The fair value of senior secured notes is taken from the quoted market price. This
is a Level 1 valuation. The fair value of all other borrowings is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at
prevailing market interest rates, categorised as a Level 2 valuation. The Group did not measure any financial assets
or financial liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis as at 30 June 2023.

There were no transfers between levels throughout the period under review.

###### 12 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: liquidity risk, credit risk, and
market risk arising from interest rate risk.

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives,
policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the
establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.

**_Market risk_**

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market prices. The key market risks affecting the Group are interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include certain borrowings and deposits. Financial instruments affected
by exchange rate risk include the Euro Notes. At 30 June 2023, the €490.0m Euro Notes had a carrying amount of
£413.3m based on an amortised cost of €480.5m and an exchange rate of 0.8601.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. During the period, the Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest
rates related primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings with floating interest rates.

As at 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group had 100% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments by way
of senior secured loan notes, amounts owed to group undertakings and lease liabilities. The Group has access to a
£145m revolving credit facility with floating interest rates but was not drawn down on this facility at the end of the
period.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate
responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and
operational liabilities and by maintaining adequate cash reserves.

The table below summaries the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities and includes contractual future
interest payments:

**_Credit risk_**

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk is low as it has limited
trade receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

###### 15 Correction of errors in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 June 2022

An adjustment to the revenue and tax expense for the 6 months ended 30 June 2022 has been recorded in the
statement of comprehensive income. These errors were corrected in the annual report for the year ended 31
December 2022 and do not impact the reported statement of comprehensive income for that year.

In Q4 2022, management identified a computational error in the way in which revenue was being calculated in the
Swiss operating segment, impacting the 6 months ended 30 June 2022 and previous financial years.

The error was confined to the Swiss operating segment and resulted from the use of legacy systems for the
calculation of revenue, which had only been used by the Swiss operating segment. These had been in place since
before the operating segment’s acquisition by the Group.

A computational error was also identified in calculating the deferred tax charge for the 6 months ended 30 June
2022.

The errors have been corrected by restated each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior period
as follows, and in opening Accumulated Losses as set out in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes

On 3 August 2023 the term of the Group’s revolving credit facility (“RCF”) was extended by 5 months from 15
August 2024 to 15 January 2025 (the “Extension period”). During the Extension period, the RCF will be subject to
a financial covenant where the net leverage ratio must be less than or equal to 7.7x when amounts drawn down
on the facility are greater than 40%. Full details of the Group’s borrowing facilities can be found in note 10.
