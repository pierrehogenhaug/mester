Quatrim S.A.S., a société par actions simplifiée organized under the laws of France, having its registered office at 1, cours Antoine Guichard, 42000 Saint-Étienne,
France (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €800.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Issuer
is owned directly by Casino Participations France S.A.S. (“CPF”), which is in turn owned directly by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. (“CGP”). The Notes will

(as defined below), Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as security agent (the “Security Agent”).
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum and will mature on January 15, 2024. The Issuer will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on the Notes
on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2020. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date. CGP and CPF, the indirect and
direct parents of the Issuer, respectively, Distribution Casino France S.A.S. (“DCF”) and Monoprix S.A.S., each a direct or indirect subsidiary of CGP (together,
the “Initial Note Guarantors”) will guarantee the Notes on a senior unsecured basis (each an “Initial **Note Guarantee” and collectively, the “Initial Note**
**Guarantees”). No later than December 31, 2019, Casino Finance S.A. (“Casino Finance”) will guarantee the Notes on a senior unsecured basis (the “Casino**

Initial Note Guarantees and the Casino Finance Note Guarantee, the “Note Guarantees”). The Note Guarantees will be subject to such limitations as described
elsewhere herein.
The Offering is expected to be consummated on the Issue Date, which may be prior to the date of the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the Offering is consummated prior thereto, pending the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
providing for the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will, concurrently with
the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into an escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the Notes (the
“Escrow Account”). The Escrow Account will be pledged on the Issue Date in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of itself and for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes (the “Escrow Account Charge”). The release of the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
If the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement does not occur on or prior to December 20, 2019, or upon the occurrence of certain other events,
the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined herein) at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein). See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”. If the Offering is consummated concurrently with or after the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility_
Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the foregoing escrow procedures will not apply, and the Initial Purchasers will transfer the net proceeds
of the Offering in accordance with the instructions provided by the Issuer on the Issue Date.
At any time prior to November 15, 2021, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date plus a “make-whole” premium, as
described in this listing prospectus (the “Listing Prospectus”). At any time on or after November 15, 2021, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth herein. The Issuer may also redeem all of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the outstanding amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain events
constituting a change of control, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. See “Description of the Notes”.
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness and will
rank senior to all of the Issuer’s future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. Each of the Note Guarantees will rank equal in right of
payment with all existing and future obligations of each Guarantor, and will rank senior in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of each Guarantor
that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee. As of the Issue Date, the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture will be secured by
the Escrow Account Charge (in the event the proceeds of the Offering are deposited into escrow, and then only until the Escrow Release Date (as defined herein))
and the Note Collateral (as defined herein) on a first-ranking basis. The Note Collateral includes pledges over (i) the securities account to which the outstanding
shares of Immobilière Groupe Casino (“IGC”) held by the Issuer are credited and which, as of the Issue Date, will contain all of the outstanding shares of IGC, (ii)
all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans, (iii) the bank accounts of the Issuer and (iv) the Bond Segregated Accounts (as defined
herein), all as described under “Description of the Notes—Security”. The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests in the Note
Collateral and the liability of the Guarantors will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit
them to trading on the Professional Segment of the Euro MTF Market. This offering memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the
Luxembourg law on Prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019.
**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 47 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with**
**an investment in the Notes.**

**Issue price for the Notes: 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

**The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or**
**the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are being offered and sold inside the United States only to**
**qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and non-U.S. persons outside the United**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

**Notice to U.S. Investors**

The Notes will be sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities
Act and within the United States to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A. In making your purchase, you will be deemed
to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements. See “Transfer Restrictions”. This Listing
Prospectus is being provided (1) to a limited number of U.S. investors that the Initial Purchasers reasonably
believe to be QIBs (as defined under Rule 144A) for informational purposes only in connection with the Offering
and (2) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes described in this Listing Prospectus have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission in the United States
or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC, any state securities commission in
the United States, or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this
Listing Prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. See “Transfer Restrictions”.

**Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A Distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in
accordance with MiFID II, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Listing Prospectus has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. In relation to each Member State of the EEA (each, a “Relevant Member State”), with effect
from and including the date on which the Prospectus Regulation is implemented in that Relevant Member State
no offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State may be made other than at any time to any legal
entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; provided that no such offer of Notes
shall require us or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 1 of the Prospectus Regulation,
or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, any person making
or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor any of the
Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial
intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes
contemplated in this Listing Prospectus.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any
Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the
terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the
Notes, as such expression may be varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Regulation in that Relevant Member State.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a Relevant Member State will be
deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of
Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation. The Issuer, each Initial Purchaser and its affiliates, and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding
the above, a person who is not a qualified investor and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in

i


-----

writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the
Offering.

**Notice to Investors in France**

in France within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and Title I of Book
II of the Règlement Général of the Autorité des marchés financiers (the French Financial Markets Authority) (the
“AMF”) and therefore has not been and will not be submitted for clearance to the AMF.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Listing Prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In some cases, these forward-looking
statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes”,
“estimates”, “aims”, “targets”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “continues”, “ongoing”, “potential”,
“product”, “projects”, “guidance”, “seeks”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “would”, “should” or, in each case, their
negative, or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans, objectives, targets,
goals, future events or intentions. The absence of such terminology does not necessarily mean that a statement is
not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts. They appear
in a number of places throughout this Listing Prospectus and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs
or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity,
prospects, competition in areas of our business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which
we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forwardlooking statements are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance
and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in
which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Listing Prospectus. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity,
and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Listing Prospectus, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or
developments in subsequent periods. Important factors that could cause those material differences include:

  - our operation in a highly competitive industry and rapidly evolving markets;

  - our exposure to economic and other trends;

  - the seasonality of our business;

  - the dependence of our sales on changing consumer preferences;

  - our exposure to political and other business risks related to our international operations;

  - the impact on retail sales of unforeseen catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks, civil unrest,
disruptive geopolitical events or natural disasters;

  - our relations with our workforce and labor representatives;

  - the risk of misappropriation of customer and employee data from our information systems;

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Statements**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and whose material assets as of the
Issue Date will consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of IGC and intragroup receivables owed to it
under the Proceeds Loans (as defined below) and, if applicable, the Escrow Account. The Issuer does not prepare,
and does not intend to prepare, consolidated financial statements at the level of the Issuer. As a result, this Listing
Prospectus instead presents consolidated financial and other data for CGP and its consolidated subsidiaries only.

The financial information contained in this Listing Prospectus is taken from CGP’s audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and CGP’s unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019 prepared in accordance with
IAS 34, the IFRS standard adopted by the EU for interim financial information, a free translation of which, in
each case, are included elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus.

CGP’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors for those years.
CGP’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019
were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors
for such period. The statutory auditors’ report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés on the audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, without qualifying the audit opinion
expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter relating to the restatements of the comparative information in
the consolidated income statement for such year, in respect of discontinued operations and the change in method
of presenting the costs of the non-recourse factoring of receivables. The auditors’ review report of Ernst & Young
et Autres and Deloitte & Associés on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the
six months ended June 30, 2019, without qualifying the conclusions expressed therein, contains an emphasis of
matter relating to the methods of implementation and the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16 Leases,
as well as significant events of liquidity risks to the Group, particularly in the context of the safeguard procedures
initiated by the controlling shareholders, the companies Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris.

This Listing Prospectus also presents unaudited financial information of CGP for the twelve-month period ended
June 30, 2019 which was calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information
for the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 – Leases, to the audited consolidated
financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from the audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 –
Leases, but restated to reflect the retroactive application of IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary
Economies. The unaudited financial information of CGP for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019 has
been prepared solely for the purposes of this Listing Prospectus, is not necessarily indicative of our results of
operations for any future period, is not prepared in the ordinary course of CGP, has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation or any
generally accepted accounting standards.

**Segment Information**

We present certain financial information in this Listing Prospectus with respect to our reporting segments. In
accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, our business is organized according to the following reporting
segments:

- Our France Retail segment includes our French retail banners (including online sales associated with such
banners, but excluding Cdiscount), our ancillary business activities in France and our Indian Ocean
operations.

- Our _E-commerce segment consists of our Cdiscount online retail business, which we hold through our_
approximately 76% economic interest, approximately 65% of which we hold directly and approximately 11%
of which we hold indirectly (as of June 30, 2019) in Cnova N.V., a Dutch publicly traded company, and which
is fully consolidated in our financial statements.

- Our _Latam Retail segment includes our interests in the Latin American retail banners of GPA and Grupo_
Éxito, in which we hold a 33% and a 55% economic interest as of June 30, 2019, respectively, but which are
fully consolidated in our financial statements due to our ultimate voting rights in these entities.

**Changes in Consolidation Scope**

Each of the Guarantors are wholly owned and fully consolidated in CGP’s audited consolidated financial
statements. As a part of our regular review of our stores’ profitability, our strategy for developing our franchising
model and expanding into market segments and formats that benefit from positive market trends and our objective
for deleveraging, we have carried out a number of acquisitions and disposals of stores and businesses. During the
periods under review in this Listing Prospectus, we have carried out a number of significant disposals, and as a
result, we have, in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,
classified certain assets as held for sale and classified income generated by certain businesses as attributable to
discontinued operations. In addition, the presentation of our statement of financial position as of December 31,
2018 has been restated to reflect the final purchase price allocation for Sarenza. For a discussion of changes in
our consolidation scope during the periods under review, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results—Changes in_
_Consolidation Scope”._

**Adoption of Certain Accounting Standards and Comparability of Financial Information Presented in this**
**Listing Prospectus**

During the periods under review in this Listing Prospectus, we have adopted certain accounting standards that
may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. For a further description
of these accounting standards and the impact of their adoption on our financial statements, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of_
_Results—Changes in Accounting Methods” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included_
elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus.

**_IFRS 16 – Leases_**

IFRS 16 – Leases, which the IASB published in January 2016 and which became mandatory for companies
reporting in IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases, and
requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right to use
the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are
recognized. Short term leases and low value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly
used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of the
expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of
our financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019, we applied the full retrospective
transition approach and have restated all comparative information for the prior comparative period in accordance
with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. We have not, however, restated
our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 presented in this Listing
Prospectus to give effect to IFRS 16.

Our discussion of our results of operations from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018
and 2019 presented herein is on a pre-IFRS 16 basis. We also present certain non-IFRS measures on a pre-IFRS
16 basis in this Listing Prospectus. See “—Other Financial Measures”. While we will be required under IFRS to
produce financial statements that give effect to IFRS 16, compliance with our covenants under the Indenture, the
New Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) and the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) will be
calculated without taking into account the impact of IFRS 16.

**_IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers_**

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers defines the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces
IAS 18 – Revenue, IAS 11 – Construction Contracts and all related interpretations. The standard defines a single
model for recognizing revenue, in five steps. It introduces new concepts and principles regarding the recognition
of revenue, in particular the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price
for contracts with multiple performance obligations.

We decided to apply IFRS 15 from January 1, 2018 under the full retrospective approach, by restating comparative
information. In view of the nature of our businesses, the application of the standard had no material impact on our
previously published revenue and trading profit. Our discussion in this Listing Prospectus of our results of
operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 presents for the comparative period the restated
amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, our discussion in this Listing Prospectus of our results
of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31,
2016 does not give effect to IFRS 15.


-----

In connection with our adoption of IFRS 15, we changed the presentation of the income statement appearing in
our consolidated financial statements beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018, with a restated presentation of the comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017. We did not, however, restate our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
December 31, 2017 (which include a presentation of comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016). To facilitate the review of these periods and present our financial information in a
comparable manner:

- where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the year ended December 31, 2018, we present such income statement information
for the year ended December 31, 2017 restated for IFRS 15; and

- where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the year ended December 31, 2016, we present such income statement information
for the year ended December 31, 2017 without any such IFRS 15 restatement, as it appears in our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyper-Inflationary Economies_**

Grupo Éxito conducts part of its business in Argentina, which has experienced hyper-inflation. Beginning on
January 1, 2018, we have applied IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies with limited
retrospective application to address this issue in our financial statements. IAS 29 requires that the statements of
financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies should be (i)
restated by applying a general price index so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit currency at the
end of the reporting period and (ii) converted into euros at the period-end exchange-rate. We have restated the
comparative period for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of our interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019. We have not restated our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 nor our consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2016 appearing therein and herein, and neither gives effect to IAS 29.

Our discussion in this Listing Prospectus of our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December
31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016 discuss our 2017 results prior to the restatement.

**_IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments_**

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments defines new principles covering the classification and measurement of financial
instruments, the recognition of impairment provisions for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting. We
have applied IFRS 9 as from January 1, 2018 by recording the cumulative impact in opening equity at the transition
date. In the aggregate, the changes resulting from our application of IFRS 9 are immaterial.

**Other Financial Measures**

This Listing Prospectus contains certain financial measures and ratios, including underlying net profit/(loss),
Group share, free cash flow before and after dividends and net interest paid, gross capital expenditure, net capital
expenditure, trading profit, EBITDA, net debt, same-store sales, organic growth and certain leverage and coverage
ratios that are not required by, defined under or presented in accordance with IFRS (the “Non-IFRS Measures”).
The information presented by Non-IFRS Measures is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

We define the Non IFRS Measures as follows:

  - **Underlying net profit/(loss), Group share corresponds to net profit from continuing operations,**
adjusted for (i) the impact of other operating income and expenses, (ii) the impact of non-recurring
financial items, (iii) income tax expense/benefit related to these adjustments and (iv) minority interests
in underlying profit/(loss) (as defined below), and excluding the share attributable to non-controlling
interests.

Non-recurring financial items consist of changes in the fair value of equity derivatives (such as total
return swaps and forward contracts on CBD shares) and the effects of discounting tax liabilities in Brazil.

  - **Minority interests in underlying profit/(loss) represent the share of underlying net profit/(loss)**
attributable to non-controlling interests. This indicator is therefore equal to net profit from continuing
operations attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for non-controlling interests in other
operating income and expenses and the impact of non-recurring financial items, as well as income tax

i


-----

expense/benefits related to these adjustments (see the definition of underlying net profit/loss, Group
share).

The Group uses these indicators to measure changes in recurring profit from operations.

- **Free cash flow before dividends and net interest paid is defined by the Group as net cash from (used**
in) operating activities, as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, less net capital
expenditure.

- **Free cash flow after dividends and net interest paid is defined by the Group as free cash flow before**
dividends and net interest paid less dividends and net interest paid.

The Group uses these indicators to measure cash flow arising from and used in operating activities.
Management believes that free cash flow thus defined provides investors with additional perspective on
cash flow available for debt repayments and acquisitions (and, in the case of Free cash flow before
dividends and net interest paid, dividends), after accounting for net capital expenditures to support
ongoing business operations, interest on borrowings and long-term value creation. Free cash flow is used
to measure Group performance and overall liquidity.

We present these indicators in this Listing Prospectus before and after giving effect to the Asset Disposal
Plan and Rocade Plan (each as defined below), as applicable, in order to highlight the impact of these
plans on our free cash flow.

- **Gross capital expenditure, corresponds to “Cash outflows related to acquisitions of property, plant and**
equipment, intangible assets and investment property”, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash
flows.

- **Net capital expenditure, a component of Free cash flow before dividends and net interest paid and Free**
cash flow after dividends and net interest paid, corresponds to gross capital expenditure less “Cash
inflows related to disposals of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property
“, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

- **Trading profit is defined as operating profit before other operating income and expenses. Other**
operating income and other operating expenses include certain items which, by definition, are not
included in an assessment of a business unit’s recurring operating performance, such as gains and losses
on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses on non-current assets, and income/expenses related
to changes in the scope of consolidation (for example, transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of
control, gains and losses from disposals of subsidiaries, remeasurement at fair value of previously-held
interests) and (ii) certain non-recurring items that would distort analyses of the Group’s recurring
profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are limited in number,
unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs (such as
reorganization costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions and expenses for
litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments).

On a pre-IFRS 16 basis, trading profit includes operating lease expenses. On a post-IFRS 16 basis, trading
profit does not include lease payments except for variable lease payments, leases for which the
underlying asset is of low value and depreciation of the right-of-use asset.

- **EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is defined as trading profit**
plus recurring depreciation and amortization expenses included in trading profit (but excluding
impairment of inventories and trade receivables, other receivables and provisions for litigation and risks
included in trade profit).

On a pre-IFRS 16 basis, trading profit includes all operating lease expenses. On a post-IFRS 16 basis,
trading profit does not include lease expenses except for variable lease expenses, leases for which the
underlying asset is of low value and depreciation of the right-of-use asset.

- **Net debt is defined as loans and other borrowings including related derivatives with a negative fair value**
designated as fair value hedges, less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash
management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii) derivatives with a positive fair value
designated as fair value hedges, (iv) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current
assets and (v) net assets held for sale attributable to direct owners of the selling subsidiary.

- **Same-store sales is defined as described in “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial**
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations—_
_Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth—Same-Store Growth”._

ii


-----

  - **Organic growth means is defined as described in “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial**
_Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations—_
_Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth—Organic Growth”._

  - **Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”), with respect to our E-commerce segment, corresponds to sales,**
including tax, made directly on Cdiscount’s websites and by independent marketplace merchants.

We present Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they provide additional information that is useful to the
market when analyzing the Group’s underlying trends, as well as its performance and financial position. These
indicators are also used by management to analyze performance. As they are not defined in any IFRS standard,
they are not directly comparable with indicators with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They
are not intended to replace the IFRS indicators presented in the financial statements, nor should they be seen as
more important.

Certain of the Non-IFRS Measures presented in this Listing Prospectus are based on a number of assumptions that
are subject to inherent uncertainties subject to change, and they may differ from actual results for the relevant
period. In addition, the preparation of such Non-IFRS Measures requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts presented for such Non-IFRS Measures in this Listing
Prospectus.

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our businesses or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet
our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the IFRS consolidated
financial statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance.

EBITDA as used in this Listing Prospectus is not calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA”,
which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture as described under “Description of the Notes”, or for the purposes
of any of our other indebtedness.

**Critical Accounting Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus.

**Rounding**

Certain figures contained in this Listing Prospectus, including financial information, have been subject to rounding
adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column or a row in tables contained
in this Listing Prospectus may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row.

**Industry and Market Data**

This Listing Prospectus contains statistical data, estimates and forecasts that are based on independent industry
publications, such as those published by Euromonitor International Limited (“Euromonitor”), or other publicly
available information, as well as other information based on our internal sources. This information involves many

services, and as such have not been independently verified by Euromonitor in each case. The industry in which
we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described
in the section titled “Risk Factors”, that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these

**Overview**

We are a leading major multi-format, multi-banner and multi-channel retailer with over 120 years of history,
offering a diverse range of products and services to customers primarily located in France and, through our
interests in Grupo Éxito and GPA, in Latin America. We offer both brand-name and private label food and
consumer products through traditional retail stores as well as e-commerce websites and apps. We also provide
business-to-business and business-to-consumer services through our portfolio of complementary lines of business.

Our retail banners operate under formats which aim to adapt to current consumer trends and needs across the
various geographies in which we operate. Our premium retail format offers many innovative services and a highquality shopping experience. Our convenience retail format is adapted to both city centers and rural areas, offering
everyday basics to meet the expectations of customers searching for quality, authenticity and service. Our
hypermarket, cash & carry and discount retail formats offer a wide range of quality products at affordable prices.
We believe most of our banners enjoy leading market positions in most of our markets.

We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed an omni-channel offering that we believe has favorably
positioned us to respond to consumer trends. We have developed partnerships with innovators such as Amazon
and Ocado in order to provide best-in-class grocery delivery services in France. Our pure-play e-commerce
platform, Cdiscount, is the second largest e-tailer in France by number of unique monthly visitors (“UMV”), and
has allowed us to offer a range of adjacent business-to-consumer and business-to-business services. In France,
Brazil and Colombia, our brick-and-mortar retail banners benefit from mobile applications and other e-commerce
functionality that allow us to provide targeted promotions to our customers and give our customers the flexibility
to shop how they want, when they want.

In addition to our retail operations, we have also developed a number of other complementary lines of business
that allow us to leverage our know-how while monetizing our asset base. These businesses include real estate
development and shopping center management, consumer finance, solar energy and energy efficiency solutions
via GreenYellow and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via 3W.relevanC and
ScaleMax, respectively.

We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although
through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other
international markets.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, without giving effect to the impact of IFRS 16, we generated €36,659
million in net sales and €1,757 million in EBITDA and our France Retail segment recorded net sales of €18,796
million and EBITDA of €903 million. Our E-commerce segment recorded net sales of €1,979 million and
EBITDA of €28 million for the same period.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading position in the French food retail market through structurally well-positioned formats and offers_**
**_aligned with new consumer trends_**

We believe that we are poised to take advantage of a number of favorable consumer trends in French food retail
as an already established market leader positioned in dynamic geographic areas and rapidly growing market
segments.

We hold leading positions in the French food retail market, the largest grocery retail market in Western Europe in
terms of retail sales value (“RSV”) (based on partial-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate retail value
measured by retail selling price, excluding sales tax), according to Euromonitor International. The RSV of the
French grocery retail market (in nominal terms and applying a constant 2018 exchange rate) has consistently
grown every year since 2014, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2018 and 2023. The graph
below shows RSV growth in the RSV of the French grocery retail market from 2014 to 2018, the RSV and its

historical growth rate in the German, British, Italian and Spanish grocery retail markets, and their respective
projected growth rates between 2018 and 2023, according to Euromonitor.

(1) Euromonitor International

According to Euromonitor International, we are the fifth largest food retailer in France, with a market share of
approximately 9.4% in 2018 (based on partial-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate retail value measured
by retail selling price, excluding sales tax). As of June 30, 2019, we had a network of 8,640 stores in France within
a diversified portfolio of 12 complementary banners, each with different strategies to meet changing consumer
expectations. Our portfolio of banners is particularly focused on convenience and premium formats, which
accounted for over 60% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and address growing demand from
French consumers. We are a leading urban convenience food retailer in France, with a network of 6,801 premium
and convenience stores that have a distinct urban focus. Approximately 63% of our France Retail net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2018 were generated in three of the fastest growing regions of France – the Ile-deFrance, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur regions – whose population accounted for 35.7% of the
total French population and approximately 48% of France’s GDP growth in 2018. The map below shows our net
sales in each of these key regions as of December 31, 2018.

In addition, we are the major French food retailer with the smallest exposure to the declining hypermarket format
(which accounted for 25% of our France Retail net sales in 2018). Finally, according to a third-party market
analysis, we were also the second largest retailer of organic products, with approximately €1.0 billion in net sales
from organic products in 2018, which represented growth of 16% over the prior year.

The table below shows the CAGR of the French grocery RSV for different formats between 2014 and 2018, the
position of our various formats and banners within the French market, their contribution to our French Retail net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and their average same-store growth in net sales from 2016 to 2018.

(1) Expressed as a percentage of France Retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(2) Sourced from Euromonitor International.

(3) Convenience segment includes other activities, Vindémia and catering.

(4) There is no available market share information on organic formats. As a result we believe that our market shares in the Convenience and
premium segments are underestimated. Our banners classified as Convenience stores by Euromonitor include Vival, Monop’, Casino
Shop and Petit Casino.

(5) Hypermarket statistics for Casino excluding Cdiscount counter shops.

(6) Casino banners classified as supermarkets by Euromonitor International include: Monoprix, Franprix and Casino Supermarkets.

(7) Represents two-year average same store sales growth due to unavailability of 2016 data.

(8) CAGR shown here refers to Convenience only as defined by Euromonitor International.

We believe that the French food retail market is characterized by a number of demographic characteristics that
are favorable for food retailers like our Group. For example, according to the IMF, the French population has
grown at a CAGR of 0.3% from 64.0 million people in 2014 to 64.7 million people in 2018, and population growth
is expected to accelerate to a CAGR of 0.5%, reaching to 66.5 million people by 2024, which necessarily means
an increase in the consumer base for food. Moreover, according to the World Bank, approximately 80% of
France’s inhabitants in 2018 lived in urban areas, favoring retailers that have a particular concentration in towns
and cities. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 53% of our stores in France were located in urban areas and
approximately 1,400 stores (including franchise and affiliate stores) operated in the Paris region alone. In addition,
according to the INSEE, approximately 33% of the French population is older than 55 years old. This segment of
the population drives an estimated 86% of food retail growth and buys an estimated 57% of fresh products, the
offer of which is a key differentiating factor among food retailers and a key source of profitability. Growth in the
French food retail market is moderate, but marked by a strong polarization of format performance, with
convenience stores expected to enjoy growth in net sales of 1.6%, supermarket net sales growth expected to be
flat and hypermarket net sales expected to decline by 1.5% in 2019. In light of our strong focus on the convenience
and premium formats and our low exposure to the hypermarket format, we expect to benefit disproportionately
from the trends favoring supermarkets and convenience formats when compared with our main competitors.

The French food retail market is also marked by consumer trends that we believe will be beneficial for our Group.
For example, we believe that food retail e-commerce has the potential to grow significantly in France due to its
current low level of penetration despite the high overall population of internet users in France. According to
information from Hootsuite, approximately 88% of the French population used the internet in 2018, with 75%
using the internet on their mobile devices and 58% active on social media. While online sales of food products
are typically lower than those of non-food products, our e-commerce food sales in France, excluding Cdiscount,

3


-----

but including sales through our partnership with Amazon, amounted to €315 million in 2018. We believe this
provides us with a significant food retail e-commerce growth opportunity. Furthermore, consumers are
increasingly leaning toward high-quality, organic goods, leading to stronger emphasis on the premium end of the
market and a decline in the mass market segment. We believe this is favorable for retailers like us, with a diverse
range of banners and an already strong position in sales of organic products. We are the only large food retailer
in France with a large-scale banner dedicated to organic products, Naturalia.

We believe that these market trends have led to the emergence of new competitors, such as physical retailers Bio
c’Bon, Biocoop and La Vie Claire in the organic retail space, Grand Frais in the fresh produce space and Action
in the discount segment; online generalist retailers like Amazon and pure players such as Nespresso and Zooplus;
business-to-consumer technology platforms that are last-mile competitors such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Frichti
and Glovo. However, we also believe that our product offering and partnerships with online retailers and delivery
services will help us answer customers’ needs and successfully face such competition.

**_Best-in-class omni-channel strategy: pioneer of food e-commerce and one of the leading non-food e-tailers_**

We are present in three e-commerce retail segments in France: food retail, through the development of our omnichannel strategy, household goods, through Cdiscount, and fashion and other personal goods, through the recent
acquisition of Sarenza by Monoprix.

E-commerce activity is an important area of development for our business, especially in light of market trends
that indicate that consumers will make an increasing share of their purchases online. Our online sales for the six
months ended June 30, 2019 in France under our retail banners, together with Cdiscount’s gross merchandise
value, grew by 10.2% as compared to the same period in 2018. Food e-commerce gross sales, including
Cdiscount’s sale volume, grew by 27.5% in the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2017. We
generated €187 million in net sales under our banners in food e-commerce during the six months ended June 30,
2019, and Cdiscount’s gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) was €1.75 billion over the same time period.

We were a first-mover in French food retail e-commerce through home delivery service partnerships that we
formed with Amazon and Ocado. Through our partnership with Amazon, Amazon Prime customers are offered
express two-hour delivery of Monoprix, Casino and Naturalia products in Paris and 35 neighboring cities. We
intend to expand the geographic area covered by this service to other major French cities by 2020. Through our
exclusive partnership with Ocado in France, we expect Monoprix to benefit by 2020 from a front-to-back online,
solution with the ability to provide customers with next-day delivery of 50,000 items with low preparation and
delivery costs, due in part to the construction of an automated warehouse in the Paris region.

We have further enhanced our brick and mortar French food retail operations with a number of digital initiatives.
For example, each of our principal French retail banners has a mobile application enabling customers to do their
shopping or monitor their loyalty card online. As of December 31, 2018, our banners’ applications have been
downloaded approximately 10 million times. Users of our Casino Max app generated approximately 13% of our
hypermarket and supermarket net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Furthermore, we have
implemented a number of digital solutions to enhance our customers’ shopping experience, such as permitting
mobile payments, digital receipts, and scan and go solutions through the Monoprix and Casino Max mobile apps.
Our banners’ apps also allow individual marketing capabilities, with personalized, targeted coupons and discounts,
which we believe is a key distinguishing factor from most of our competitors.

Cdiscount, our pure-play e-commerce platform, is the second-largest e-tailer in France by number of unique
monthly visitors, with an average of 19.6 million monthly unique visitors to its website during the second quarter
of 2019, based on a market study by Médiamétrie. In 2018, the difference in market share based on retail sales
value excluding sales tax between Amazon, the e-tailer with the largest share of the non-food products ecommerce market in France, and Cdiscount, the e-tailer with the second-largest share of the non-food products ecommerce market non-food e-tailer in France, is the smallest when compared to the difference between Amazon
and other European non-food e-tailers’ market share in their home markets. Cdiscount sold €3.6 billion in GMV
of products and services during the year ended December 31, 2018, of which 34% was sold by third-party
merchants through Cdiscount’s marketplace platform. The GMV contribution from products and services sold
through the Cdiscount marketplace has increased over recent years, from 32% of total GMV in 2017 to 34% in
2018 and 40% during the six months ended June 30, 2019. Cdiscount’s online marketplace is the most profitable
portion of its operations because Cdiscount is able to generate net sales through the commissions it receives from
marketplace sellers with limited associated operating costs or working capital investments. We aim to continue to
expand the share of GMV represented by the Cdiscount marketplace in the coming years.

We believe Cdiscount benefits from a strong competitive advantage through its nine million active customers and
its successful Cdiscount à Volonté loyalty program, through which over two million members have the ability to
have free one-day delivery of more than 280,000 items, with on-demand delivery within 30-minute time slots in

Paris, as well as unlimited online access to 200 magazines. The delivery offerings through Cdiscount à Volonté
are made possible by our superior logistics infrastructure, which is capable of handling both heavy and small
products.

We have been able to leverage the Cdiscount platform to offer adjacent business-to-customer services, such as
discount travel, event ticketing, discount energy (through a partnership with GreenYellow), Coup de Pouce
consumer finance loans through its partnership with Banque Casino and insurance. We have also been able to
offer business-to-business services, including fulfilment services to our marketplace vendors, which accounted
for approximately 21% of Cdiscount’s marketplace GMV in 2018, and additional services, such as advertising
and visibility-boosting services. We intend to further develop and expand such service offerings in the future.

Finally, we have been able to roll-out Cdiscount’s reach beyond France to 25 countries in Europe, and have
established partnerships with 45 online European marketplaces as of September 2019. We intend to further expand
Cdiscount’s international operations in the future, such as through initiatives like International Marketplace
Network, our recent alliance with three online marketplaces – in each of Germany, Italy and Romania – that allows
marketplace vendors in each geographic region to access the wider consumer market of all four websites.

Our e-commerce ambitions are not limited to our sales of food products and Cdiscount alone. For example, in
2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, a website dedicated to the sale of shoes, fashion and other personal goods.
Monoprix intends to integrate and develop Sarenza as a key online player in the personal goods retail sector in
France.

**_Asset-light model and further acceleration in new businesses_**

In recent years, we have focused on developing an asset-light business model in France through the active
management of our real estate portfolio and encouraging the development of a franchisee network in stores across
our various French banners. We also have developed new lines of business, including solar energy, data analysis
for digital advertising and data centers, that take advantage of our physical footprint and accumulated know-how
from running a major retail group.

We believe that there is limited upside potential from the valuation of commercial real estate in France, and have
undertaken significant disposals of our real estate portfolio, including through entering into sale and leaseback
transactions. As of December 31, 2018, the market value of our owned real estate portfolio in France was estimated
to be approximately €2.6 billion, including transfer duties and excluding our share of property held by Mercialys,
a property development business in which we hold 25% of the voting rights. During 2019, we have sold, or entered
into agreements to sell, real estate assets for a total sales price of €750 million (excluding transfer duties). We
believe these disposals have strengthened our balance sheet, as we anticipate limited or no upside on the valuation
of commercial real estate assets in France, while giving us the operational flexibility to compete in a dynamic
competitive environment.

As for the real estate that we have retained, we have endeavored to upgrade our properties, including our Casino
Supermarkets and Monoprix stores, to improve customers’ shopping experience and boost sales. We have further
reduced average selling area in our hypermarkets by 11% from 2015, through space optimization and
specialization on premises, such as transforming selling or stocking areas into additional retail areas in shopping
centers that are adjacent to our hypermarkets and can be leased to third parties. As a result, based on information
from LSA Conso, the average selling area of our hypermarkets was 6,950 square meters as of December 31, 2018,
compared with 9,184 square meters for Carrefour hypermarkets and 10,460 square meters for Auchan
hypermarkets. We expect that hypermarket sales will represent an increasingly smaller proportion of our France
total gross sales in the coming years.

We have also encouraged the development of our franchisee network as a means of transitioning to an asset-light
model with lower capital expenditures. Growth in our franchisee network has also had a positive impact on our
France Retail sales: we estimate that new franchisees (including the Quattrucci family, whose stores generated
over €300 million in gross sales in 2017, before such stores were part of our Group) joining our network of French
retail stores in 2018.

The chart below shows the number of franchise stores in our network by banner and the percentage of the total
number of stores under each banner such franchise stores represent as of June 30, 2019.

(1) Including international franchised affiliates

(2) Including Naturalia franchisees

Finally, we have developed new business lines in France that we believe will provide us with significant
opportunities to grow our revenue and further monetize our asset base. These include:

  - GreenYellow, our solar energy and energy efficiency business. We have leveraged our in-house energy
efficiency and energy savings know-how in developing GreenYellow’s business with third parties.
GreenYellow had a pipeline of 350 MWp of future solar projects as of June 30, 2019. We believe the
potential of GreenYellow’s business has been further strengthened by our successful €150 million capital
raise from Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance in 2018.

  - 3W.relevanC, our advertising business in which we use our data analysis know-how to develop targeted
campaigns for our clients. As of September 30, 2019, 3W.relevanC had a database of 33.6 million
anonymized customers, with information on their in-store and online behavior from which it can create
specific customer profiles. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and the six months ended June 30,
2019, 3W.relevanC generated €41 million and €24 million, respectively, in net sales, and we aim to
increase 3W.relevanC’s net sales going forward.

  - ScaleMax, our recent data center business, which has set up its computing services in space available in
our warehouses and in stocking areas, allowing us to offer prices that are significantly below the market
average because, among other factors, we do not need to incur additional rental or security costs.
ScaleMax’s first data center was set up in a Cdiscount warehouse in the first half of 2019.

**_Proactive portfolio management to seize market opportunities and create value_**

We actively manage our businesses, seeking disposal and acquisition opportunities where we believe we can best
derive value for our companies. We also actively seek out and enter into partnerships with third parties in order
to better serve our customers and leverage market trends.

Our Group has historically been able to benefit from our acquisitions of banners with successful formats and name
recognition in markets characterized by favorable trends. Our Group was built through a series of key acquisitions
and combinations, including our acquisition of a stake in Monoprix in 1997, the entirety of which we purchased
in July 2013, the purchase of a majority interest in Franprix and Leader Price in 1997, our acquisition of a stake
in Grupo Éxito in 1999 (in which we acquired a further stake in 2007), our investment in CBD in 1999, our
acquisition of Naturalia in 2008 and, most recently, our purchase of Sarenza in 2018.

We also have a proven history of successfully monetizing our assets through the pursuit of opportunistic disposals.
For example, in 2016, we successfully completed a disposal plan of approximately €4.0 billion through the
disposals of our businesses in Thailand and Vietnam, with significant capital gains associated with these
transactions. In June 2018, following a review of our business portfolio, we announced the launch of an asset
disposal plan covering non-core assets, in particular real estate assets, for a value of €1.5 billion to be completed
by the end of 2019. This plan complemented our already planned disposal of Via Varejo, a Brazilian appliance
retailer, the sale of which was completed in June 2019. We successfully completed the entire plan ahead of
schedule in January 2019, primarily through the execution of sale and leaseback agreements with respect to certain
of our stores’ real estate and the sale of a 15% stake in Mercialys, a commercial real estate management business
in which we have kept a 25% minority stake. We therefore decided to increase the size of the plan to a targeted

-----

€2.5 billion, the Asset Disposal Plan, with the additional €1.0 billion of disposals due to be completed by the first
quarter of 2020. Of this €2.5 billion amount, agreements in respect of disposals of approximately €2.1 billion have
been signed to date, of which €1.8 billion have been completed following the closing of the sale of certain real
estate assets to Apollo Global Management, Inc. on October 17, 2019 and €0.3 billion have been signed and are
to be completed. We subsequently completed a strategic review of our assets in France and announced on August
20, 2019 that we would carry out a second phase of our Asset Disposal Plan for a target amount of €2.0 billion (in
addition to the existing €2.5 billion plan described above) to be raised by the end of the first quarter of 2021 in
order to accelerate the completion of our strategic focus on the best performing formats and most promising
geographic markets. In addition to the Asset Disposal Plan, we have also begun implementing the Rocade Plan,
pursuant to which we have undertaken a thorough review of our loss-making stores and have been disposing
and/or closing such stores. As of July 24, 2019, we had signed agreements for the disposal of integrated stores for
an aggregate sales price of €233 million and intend to continue rightsizing our footprint. Moreover, on September
19, 2019, following speculative news coverage of our business strategy, we confirmed that we were in talks with
Aldi in connection with a possible transaction involving Leader Price as part of our Asset Disposal Plan described
above.

Finally, we have sought and intend to continue seeking out partnerships with third parties to expand the products
and services we provide to our customers in an efficient manner. Such partnerships include the partnership
between our Group and Amazon in France, which began in March 2018, pursuant to which Amazon Prime
customers can receive home delivery of Monoprix groceries in Paris, which has recently expanded to include
Casino and Naturalia products and which we intend to expand to locations elsewhere in France. We also have
entered into a partnership with Ocado, the world’s leading online grocery specialist, to develop a scalable, modular
end-to-end solution for an e-commerce grocery platform, including a fully automated warehouse in the Paris
region. This solution will enable us to rapidly deliver large grocery orders to online customers. Moreover, in June
2018, our Group, together with the Auchan Retail, Metro and Schiever groups, announced the signature of several
agreements establishing the Horizon purchasing alliance, which aims to focus on moving away from purely
transactional negotiations toward a collaborative, balanced and innovative type of negotiations with suppliers.
After securing approval from competition authorities, Horizon has been operational since February 2019.

**_High-growth operations in attractive Latin American markets_**

Through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, we have a highly developed network of retail banners in a number
of attractive formats in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Uruguay.

The Latin American business benefits from attractive and fast-growing markets with strong underlying
macroeconomic trends, including a growing population of over 300 million, which is favorable for food retailers.
As an established player in these markets, we believe we stand to benefit from the favorable demographics of
these countries, combined with their improving economies.

Despite a high rate of urbanization, the penetration rate of modern grocery stores in these markets remains
relatively low. As a result of this, as well as the rapid development in these countries of digitalization and
urbanization rates, we expect rapid structural changes in the region. In this context, we believe that retail groups
like ours with extensive digital know-how and omni-channel capabilities are especially well-positioned to benefit
from growth in Latin America, where digital media has had an extensive impact.

In Brazil, GPA was the largest player in grocery retail and one of the largest players in the cash & carry market
in 2018, with net sales of €11,416 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and €5,914 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019, as compared with net sales of €5,561 million for the six months ended June 30,
2018. As of June 30, 2019, GPA had a network of 1,059 stores throughout the country. GPA is active across
various formats, channels and regions of Brazil.

The chart below shows GPA’s Brazilian banners as of June 30, 2019 and their respective contribution to GPA’s
net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

According to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2019 edition, Assaí, GPA’s cash & carry banner, was one of
the country’s largest players in this segment in 2018 based on market share in terms of retail sales price excluding
sales tax at fixed euro exchange rates and B2B sales. Assaí’s have shown organic growth in net sales of over 20%
for each of the past six years and, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, Assaí’s net sales accounted for 50% of
GPA’s total net sales, an increase from 24% for the year ended December 31, 2014.

GPA is also a pioneer in food e-commerce, digital transformation and innovation in Brazil. Its digital initiatives
include:

  - James Delivery: In December 2018, GPA acquired 100% of the startup that operates the application
James Delivery, a multiservice platform for ordering and delivering various products.

  - Digital loyalty program: The “My Discount” mobile application, which enables customers to access and
use customized coupons, has been downloaded more than 9.3 million times as of June 30, 2019,
representing a large portion of GPA’s 19.3 million customers registered under loyalty programs.

  - Cheftime: At the end of 2018, GPA entered into a partnership with Cheftime, a pioneering foodtech
startup that sells individual gastronomic kits and offers customers an online subscription service.
Implemented under the Pão de Açúcar banner, Cheftime has sold over 41,000 kits sold since its launch.

  - Partnerships with startups: GPA has created an internal lab to reinforce its cooperation with startups and
achieve increased speed and efficiency in its product launches. Approximately 300 startups have been
mapped through the lab, of which 33 have been approved.

  - Microsoft: GPA has entered into a partnership with Microsoft to design a new store model, with sensors
capable of interacting with its banners’ digital platforms and additional features such as lockers, facial
recognition and self-checkout.

We operate in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina through our interests in Grupo Éxito, which generated €1,988
million in net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and €4,153 million in net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

As of June 30, 2019, Grupo Éxito operated a network of 531 stores (excluding independent affiliate stores), with
a diverse range of formats and innovative propositions. Grupo Éxito also offers consumers a complementary
offering of financial services and consumer finance options through its finance joint venture Tuya. Finally, Grupo
Éxito has successfully leveraged its significant real estate holdings by launching and growing a commercial
property development business, Viva Malls, the largest commercial property developer in Colombia, with
approximately 565,000 square meters of gross leasable area (“GLA”) as of June 30, 2019.

In Colombia, Grupo Éxito has launched several initiatives in relation to food e-commerce, digitalization and
innovation. These initiatives include:

  - Mobile applications: The Éxito and Carulla banners launched mobile applications in the first quarter of
2019 which enable customers to access customized coupons. Since their launch, the applications have
been downloaded almost 1.2 million times.

  - Rappi: Grupo Éxito has entered into a strategic partnership with Rappi, a delivery service startup, to
improve its delivery services.

  - Customer service experience: Grupo Éxito is in the process of rolling out several payment solutions to
improve its customers’ shopping experience.

Grupo Éxito, through its banners Devoto, Disco and Géant, is a leading food retailer in Uruguay. Although Grupo
Éxito offers a range of different formats in Uruguay, it has particularly focused its expansion efforts on its Devoto
Express convenience stores. In addition, Grupo Éxito has implemented an operational excellence program in order
to boost productivity and counteract the effects of inflation on operating expenses. As a result of such efforts,
Grupo Éxito’s Uruguayan operations are highly profitable, with a 7.5% EBITDA margin for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

In Argentina, Libertad is present in the Córdoba region, with 24 hypermarkets and convenience stores. Libertad
also continued to seek opportunities to optimize its real estate portfolio, with a total GLA of approximately
170,000 square meters as of December 31, 2018. We believe Libertad is the third-largest real estate player in
Argentina.

**_Extensive record of financial achievements in France_**

We have a history of successfully executing plans to improve our France Retail financial performance and
financial position. Our France Retail trading profit, excluding property development activities, has increased at a
CAGR of approximately 22% from 2014 through 2018, and its trading profit margin, calculated as a percentage
of net sales, has increased by 0.4 percentage points per year over the same time period. Our France Retail same
store net sales have also generally evolved favorably since 2014.

We have been able to reduce our combined France Retail and E-commerce net debt over the past years, from €7.1
billion as of December 31, 2014 to €2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. We believe that a significant part of this
success is due to our ability to carry out targeted asset disposals through our various disposal plans as described
above. We believe that our successful track record in executing these opportunistic disposals has not only
generated significant value through the monetization of our asset base, but has also enabled us to focus our
business model in France on a core set of activities adapted to the needs of today’s consumers.

We intend to carry out a number of initiatives to improve our France Retail free cash flow generation to support
further reductions in our net debt. For further detail on our financial strategy, see “—Our Strategies—Continue
_transformation into a less capital-intensive business model with a strong focus on improving profitability and_
_cash flow generation and proactive deleveraging in France”._

**_Highly experienced management team to drive sustainable profitable growth_**

We benefit from the expertise of a senior management team that has significant experience in grocery retail and
corporate finance. Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CGP since 2005, acquired
our indirect majority shareholder Rallye, itself a former chain of supermarkets, in 1991, and implemented its
merger with Casino in 1992. Mr. Naouri holds degrees from the École Normale Supérieure and the École
Nationale d’Administration and has a doctorate from Harvard University. We also benefit from the services of
our talented team of divisional managers, who more closely oversee the day-to-day operations of our retail banners
and our purchasing functions. Each draws upon significant experience in the retail sector and most of them have
been with our Group for many years.

**Our Strategy**

**_Accelerate leadership in convenience, organic and premium formats in France_**

We intend to capitalize on French consumer trends by further focusing on and developing our well positioned
formats and product range. We aim to adjust our mix of formats to best position our business for long-term growth.
We also aim to continue to expand our premium and convenience stores, formats which we believe will continue
to be particularly promising over the medium term, with the goal of opening 300 new stores by 2021. In particular,
to take advantage of consumers’ increased preference for organic products, we intend to develop our organic
product offering in each of our banners and speed up the expansion of our Naturalia stores. Through this and the
promotion of organic products through our digital distribution channels, including our partnership with Amazon
Prime, we believe that our net sales of organic products will continue to increase over the next few years.
Moreover, we plan to further reduce our exposure to the hypermarket format from its 21% share of France total
gross sales under banner in 2018, by focusing on our most profitable locations. With respect to the remainder of
the hypermarket portfolio, we expect to focus on initiatives to maximize real estate efficiency and area utilization.

We also plan to enhance our existing store network in France to meet changes in consumers’ tastes and needs. We
intend to continue developing new concepts and services in our stores, such as the Franprix Noé concept, which

9


-----

consists of lifestyle stores focusing on organic, healthy and fair-trade products, Le Drugstore Parisien, a
partnership with L’Oréal Paris, and Le 4 Casino, a phygital store with several digital innovations. Most recently,
we have launched a pilot store in Paris for our newest concept, Darwin, a Franprix store offering consumers a host
of conveniences, including full kitchen access, a large seating and dining area and the ability to shop for products
from other brands, such as Cdiscount and home goods retailer Hema, in store. We also intend to provide catering
services across our various banners, such as in-store salad bars and snack areas. Finally, we intend to expand our
network of autonomous Monoprix, Franprix and Casino supermarkets in order to improve customer service and
increase net sales from expanded opening hours.

**_Continue to strengthen our leadership in digital and omni-channel initiatives in France and pursue_**
**_innovations in all parts of our business_**

Innovation and digital transformations are two major axes of our development strategy. We intend to leverage
favorable consumer trends and our strong experience in digital and omni-channel offerings by increasing our focus
on efforts to expand our e-commerce activities in food retail, further developing our Cdiscount business, growing
our digital customer relationships and rolling out further innovative concepts and solutions.

Leveraging on the full deployment of our partnership with Ocado to develop a fully automated warehouse and
with the expansion of the delivery area through which Amazon Prime customers can order Monoprix, Casino and
Naturalia products, we aim to generate significant food e-commerce sales in the near- to medium-term.

In our pure-play e-commerce business, we intend to increase Cdiscount’s GMV through the further development
of our marketplace, which we expect will account for an increasing share of Cdiscount’s net sales in the coming
years. We also intend to further expand Cdiscount’s business-to-business and business-to-customer services
offering within France, and to more generally expand Cdiscount’s operations to other European countries through
direct delivery to countries neighboring France and the further development of partnerships with marketplaces
abroad.

Finally, we aim to reinforce our digital customer relationships through the increased penetration of our banners’
mobile applications. We also plan to expand Scan & Go capabilities to all of our stores by 2021.

In October 2018, we launched Le 4 Casino, the first store in France without a traditional cashier, the technology
of which was deployed over 146 stores (with 188 stores targeted by the end of 2019), allowing for 24/7 store
operation without the presence of cashiers. In March 2019, we opened a logistics innovation lab in the Géant
hypermarket in Pessac, France, where 15 technology solutions are currently being tested in partnership with the
most innovative startups in the field.

These innovative solutions were made possible with the launch of Maxit, a “digital factory” covering our various
banners, employing 40 experts in the digital field and focusing on technology innovation, such as through the
development of the Casino Max, Leader Price and Vindémia mobile applications. Since their launch, these
applications have generated traffic of more than 5 million views per month. Maxit regularly liaises with startups
to develop projects to improve the customer experience.

In addition, Cdiscount runs dozens of tests with startups each year to develop innovative solutions. For instance,
in July, Cdiscount signed a partnership with FACIL’iti to adapt its website for people with disabilities.

Our innovation initiatives also include new activities with strong growth potential, such as the deployment of
electrical vehicle charging stations in our parking lots or ScaleMax, a cloud computing solution developed in our
warehouses and store stocking areas. Each of these projects, in line with our asset-light strategy, have been
developed in exclusive or limited partnerships with the most advanced startups, franchisees with long-standing
relationships with us or with other external specialist teams.

**_Increase pace of development of new activities in France_**

We believe that our new energy and data businesses in France will provide us with significant opportunities to
grow our revenue and further monetize our asset base.

In our solar energy business, we aim to further bolster our leadership position while developing newer activities.
We aim to consolidate GreenYellow’s leadership position in solar energy with a target to increase its installed
capacity, which has already grown significantly, with an installed base of 190 MWp as of December 31, 2018 and
a pipeline representing 350 MWp of future projects as of June 30, 2019. We also aim to consolidate our leadership
position in solar self-consumption in France by continuing to leverage our joint venture partnership with Engie,
pursuant to which we help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their
electricity needs. Further, we plan to continue growing our energy performance contract offering, which is a
contract with GreenYellow through which GreenYellow commits to achieve reductions in energy costs and total

10


-----

energy consumed, with external customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had already entered into approximately
€66 million of such contracts. Finally, we intend to further develop our business-to-customer services and expand
our offering through electricity sales to individual customers via Cdiscount Energie and the development of a new
natural gas offering that we intend to launch by the end of 2019.

We also plan to continue growing our data and data centers businesses in order to increase the potential
contribution from such businesses, which generated €41 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We expect to target such growth through accelerating the development of 3W.relevanC’s core activities, as well
as expanding its retail search marketing operations, which develop advertising campaigns linked to internet users’
searches. We also intend to license our Casino Max app and its targeted coupon platform to business-to-business
customers. Finally, through our ScaleMax business, we intend to generalize the use of data centers in our logistics
warehouses and hypermarket stocking areas.

**_Encourage fast growth in Latin America_**

We intend to grow the businesses of GPA and Grupo Éxito through the execution of a range of initiatives at GPA
in Brazil and Grupo Éxito in Colombia that we believe will lead to increased net sales.

In Brazil, GPA’s strategy is centered on four key pillars:

  - Portfolio optimization: GPA intends to continue expanding Assaí cash & carry stores and associated net
sales, with a target of 20 new stores to be opened by year-end. GPA also intends to revitalize and revamp
its other Brazilian banners, through converting certain Extra supermarket stores into Compre Bem and
Mercado Extra stores, renovating its Pão de Açúcar stores and improving the attractiveness of its
commercial retail spaces.

  - Review of our product range: GPA aims to increase the proportion of private-label products in its sales
mix through repositioning its Qualitá private label brand. In 2018, GPA introduced 500 new products,
worked closely with its suppliers to ensure higher production levels to improve profitability and launched
a new marketing model and promotional campaigns.

  - Digital transformation: GPA intends to increase revenue by continuing to pursue its digital and ecommerce initiatives, including through the deployment of delivery platform James Delivery in São
Paulo and 10 other cities by the end of 2019, expansion of GPA’s Cheftime application delivering meal
kits to the São Paulo region of Brazil and extending GPA’s click and collect and home delivery services
to a greater number of stores.

  - Operation / efficiency: GPA has developed a number of initiatives to optimize its gross margin, including
increasing the proportion of higher-margin product offerings, investing in tools to optimize pricing in
each of its store formats and regions and customizing promotions for a better return on investment.

We intend to continue Grupo Éxito’s transformation strategy through carrying out a number of different initiatives.

  - Focus on fast-growing formats: Grupo Éxito plans to expand the recently introduced cash & carry format
in Colombia through the additional openings and conversion of existing stores into stores under the
Surtimayorista banner. Grupo Éxito also intends to continue launching new concepts in Colombia, such
as the Éxito WOW concept in its hypermarkets, which offers a complete revamp of its food and nonfood product selection, and the FreshMarket concept in its Carulla premium supermarkets, with an
improved selection of fresh and healthy products.

  - Digital transformation: Grupo Éxito believes that local market conditions are favorable for the
development of omni-channel marketing solutions, including increased e-commerce, retail mobile
applications and last-mile delivery services. Consequently, Grupo Éxito intends to accelerate the
development of its digital and omni-channel activities in Colombia through efforts to increase the number
of users of the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications and expanding the Puntos Colombia loyalty
program application that Grupo Éxito has developed in partnership with Bancolombia with rewards that
can be used by customers at several companies.

  - Property development: Grupo Éxito plans to continue expanding its Viva Malls property development
business in Colombia, which has become the leading player in the Colombian commercial property
market.

**_Unlock additional value through simplifying our Group’s structure in Latin America_**

We are currently in the process of reorganizing the holding structure of our various Latin American holdings in
order to simplify our organization with the objective of improving the valuation of the publicly listed Latin

11


-----

American companies. On October 19, 2019, CBD announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Sendas had
published the first notice of an all-cash public tender offer to purchase any and all shares of Almacenes Éxito,
including the 55.3% of Almacenes Éxito shares indirectly held by CGP through Tevir. In addition, CGP and Onper
have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the 50% stake in Segisor, a French holding company of CBD,
held by Onper would be sold to CGP, leading to CGP being the 100% owner of Segisor. We intend to have CBD’s
shares migrated to the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 - Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. (formerly BM&F Bovespa)
stock exchange, which would entail converting CBD’s preferred shares (which are currently the shares that are
publicly listed) into ordinary shares at a one-to-one exchange ratio and aligning CBD’s corporate governance with
the stricter rules imposed by the Novo Mercado.

After the implementation of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will hold 41.4% of GPA’s shares and
GPA will control Grupo Éxito and its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Argentina. We expect to be able to continue
fully consolidating GPA and Grupo Éxito into our consolidated financial statements. However, neither GPA,
Grupo Éxito nor their respective subsidiaries will be considered our subsidiaries for purposes of the covenants in
the Indenture. Consequently, the covenants will not restrict any actions at those entities. See “Summary—The
_Latam Reorganization Transactions”. This is expected to materially increase the liquidity of the market in GPA’s_
shares and increase their appeal to international investors.

Although we estimate that the reorganization will have a net negative cash impact on our French business of
approximately €100 million after giving effect to the repayment of €195 million under the outstanding Segisor
loan, we believe that such reorganization will eliminate the implicit holding company and corporate governance
discounts to the valuation of the Latin American businesses.

A comparison of our current Latin American shareholding structure and the intended simplified shareholding
structure following the reorganization is below.

For further information on the structure of our Group following the reorganization of the Latin American
businesses, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”.

**_Continue transformation into a less capital-intensive business model with a strong focus on improving_**
**_profitability and cash flow generation and proactive deleveraging in France_**

We have launched a number of initiatives to achieve improvements in several financial metrics in France,
including our costs of operations, trading profit, capital expenditures, net debt and working capital requirements.

We intend to optimize head office expenses at the corporate level and at the level of each of our banners and
reduce store costs, continue to negotiate better purchasing conditions for goods, realize logistics synergies through
unifying the logistics serving our Casino, Franprix and Leader Price banners and close or dispose of loss-making
stores through our Rocade Plan in order to save costs. During the first half of 2019, we have already made
significant progress toward our cost savings goals. We have already achieved significant run-rate savings,
including approximately €60 million in cost savings through head office and store costs reductions of
approximately €29 million, purchasing savings of approximately €16 million and logistics synergies of
approximately €15 million, each on a full-year basis. In addition, through our progress on the Rocade Plan, we
disposed of 15 hypermarkets, 13 supermarkets and 11 Leader Price stores and closed a further 56 stores across
our various French banners, leading to a positive impact on trading profit that we estimate would be approximately
€52 million on a full-year basis. We have also disposed of eight franchised supermarkets and nine franchised
Leader Price stores and have closed 62 franchised stores, leading to an estimated positive impact of approximately
€27 million in trading profit for the franchisees on a full-year basis, with an expected €13 million of normalized
net income for our Group. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We may not be able
_to implement our business strategy”._

-----

We also seek to improve our France Retail trading profit through improvements in format mix and an emphasis
on organic and fresh food products, through developing retail-adjacent sources of revenue from our new
businesses GreenYellow, 3W.relevanC and Scale Max, and through the continued disposal of loss-making stores.

We are continuing to focus our retail gross capital expenditures on initiatives that we believe will have a favorable
impact on the development of our business, with a targeted level of approximately €350 million per year from
2019 through 2021. We believe this will include investments in the further digitalization of our retail activities,
such as the recent launch of the Leader Price mobile application, the development of e-commerce initiatives such
as our partnerships with Ocado and Amazon. We believe this level of capital expenditure is adequate after years
of significant investment in revamping our banners and implementing new concepts, such as the Mandarine
concept in Franprix stores, intended to transform them into friendly, practical and pleasant stores. In addition, the
development of franchises has reduced our capital expenditure requirements, as franchisees finance the capital
expenditures for the stores that they operate.

We aim to reduce our year-end net debt through continuing our favorable track record of deleveraging in France.
We intend to achieve this goal through improving our free cash flow generation, continuing the Rocade Plan,
pursuing our €4.5 billion Asset Disposal Plan and the absence of dividend payments until the end of 2020. We
believe we have made significant progress on these initiatives already, having already signed approximately €2.1
billion of asset disposals out of the announced €4.5 billion, of which transactions approximately €1.8 billion have
closed. As of July 24, 2019, we had also signed agreements for the disposal of integrated stores for an aggregate
sales price of €233 million.

Finally, we aim to improve our working capital requirements, primarily through reducing inventories. We aim to
reduce inventories through a number of different initiatives, including ceasing to offer products which are cashconsuming, extending logistics pooling between our banners, which previously had been limited to frozen goods,
to a wider range of products and closer tracking through advanced digital inventories solutions. We have already
demonstrated improvement in this respect, having generated a cash inflow from changes in inventories during the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019 of €105 million, which is an improvement on our performance in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018.

In the context of such performance and strategic positioning initiatives, we have set ourselves a target of reducing
our France Retail net debt to €1.5 billion on a sustainable basis.

_The foregoing discussion includes forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to uncertainty. Our_
_ability to realize these targets may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,_
_including the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Listing Prospectus. The occurrence_
_or exacerbation of one or more of the risks described under “Risk Factors” could have a material impact on our_
_ability to realize the targets described above. We make no undertaking to update any of the foregoing targets_
_except as required by applicable laws and regulations._

**The Issuer**

Quatrim S.A.S. (the “Issuer”) is organized as a société par actions simplifiée under the laws of France. It is
registered in France under sole identification number 833 032 121 R.C.S. Saint-Étienne. Its registered office is
located at 1, cours Antoine Guichard, 42000 Saint-Étienne, France.

The Issuer is indirectly wholly owned by CGP through its subsidiary CPF. The Issuer is a holding company whose
principal asset is its 100% stake in the share capital of IGC and, on the Issue Date, intragroup receivables owed
to it under the Proceeds Loans and, if applicable, the Escrow Account. IGC is a French company whose primary
activity is the direct or indirect holding (through a number of subsidiaries) of real estate or leases to real estate
used in the Group’s France Retail operations, as described below.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will not be, and after giving effect to the Permitted Specific Perimeter
Reorganization (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), we do not expect that the Issuer
will be considered to be a “principal subsidiary” for purposes of the negative pledge provisions included in the
Existing EMTN Bonds. For a further description of such negative pledge provisions, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Existing EMTN Bonds—Common Provisions”._

The Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by pledges over (i) the securities account to which the
outstanding shares of IGC held by the Issuer are credited and which, as of the Issue Date, will contain all of the
outstanding shares of IGC, (ii) all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans, (iii) the
bank accounts of the Issuer and (iv) the Bond Segregated Accounts. Although no appraisals of any collateral have
been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Note Collateral represents less than 10% of our
consolidated revenue and consolidated assets. The value of the Note Collateral resides mainly in the value of the
shares of IGC, which will be significantly impacted by the value of the real estate assets which are directly and

13


-----

indirectly owned by IGC. As a consequence, although not part of the Note Collateral, the value of the real estate
assets directly and indirectly owned by IGC will have a significant impact on the value of the Note Collateral.
There can be no assurance that the Note Collateral will be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.
The value of the real estate assets directly and indirectly controlled by IGC is subject to change and may be
impacted by many factors beyond our control, including general macroeconomic conditions, evolution of the real
estate market in a specific area of France and the assessment of French courts in the case of insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings in France; if certain insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings are opened in respect of IGC
and/or its subsidiaries, it is possible that subsidiaries and/or their real estate or other assets could be disposed of
for significantly less than their in bonis market value. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the
_Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—The Note Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the_
_obligations under the Notes, the Notes being secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been_
_and will be granted as security for the Notes” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on_
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**IGC**

IGC is a French company whose primary activity is the direct or indirect holding (through a number of
subsidiaries) of real estate or leases to real estate used in the Group’s France Retail operations.

A number of entities that are currently joint ventures with IGC and direct or indirect subsidiaries owned by IGC,
as well as certain real estate assets held by IGC and its subsidiaries may be sold or transferred to other entities of
the Group (the “IGC Reorganization”). These assets and entities include:

  - joint ventures (and their subsidiaries) entered into between IGC and funds controlled or managed by
Apollo Global Management, Inc. and Fortress Investment Group LLC in connection with sale and
leaseback transactions;

  - real estate assets or legal entities that own real estate assets in respect of which we have signed sale
agreements with third parties or for the sale of which we are in advanced discussions with third parties;

  - the legal entities that own our stake in Mercialys;

  - certain legal entities that do not own, directly and indirectly, any real estate assets or shares in real estate
investment vehicles;

  - GreenYellow; and

  - cash and receivables held by IGC and its subsidiaries on the Issue Date.

Certain of these sales or transfers may only occur after the Issue Date.

**_Overview of Real Estate Assets_**

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC owns a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, which have
been valued (based on third-party valuations as of December 31, 2018) at approximately €1,026 million (inclusive
of transfer taxes) and approximately €966 million (excluding transfer taxes), comprising:

  - stores, including hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores;

  - other operating assets, including shopping malls adjacent to stores, parking lots, service stations, land
and restaurants; and

  - non-operating assets, including shares in real estate investment vehicles (organismes de placement
_collectif en immobilier) and joint ventures._

_correct, accurate or complete”._

(2) Represents expected rental revenues to be generated between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020.

_Stores_

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC owns 30 hypermarkets, valued at approximately €366 million
(including transfer taxes) and approximately €343 million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December 31, 2018,
that generated net sales of approximately €746 million in 2018 and are located across France. They are expected
to generate approximately €26 million of rental revenues between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020,
providing a return of approximately 7% (such return calculated as the expected annual rental revenues from such
stores divided by the stores’ valuation including transfer taxes). See “—Leases” below. The top five hypermarkets
held by IGC accounted for 26% of this valuation as of December 31, 2018 and 20% of the net sales generated by
the hypermarkets held by IGC for the year ended December 31, 2018.

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC also owns 33 supermarkets, valued at approximately €72
million (including transfer taxes) and approximately €67 million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December 31,
2018, that generated sales of approximately €145 million in 2018 and are located across France. They are expected
to generate approximately €6 million of rental revenues between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020,
providing a return of approximately 8% (such return calculated as the expected annual rental revenues from such
stores divided by the stores’ valuation including transfer taxes ). The top five supermarkets held by IGC and
operated directly by us (of which three are located in Marseille) accounted for approximately 49% of this valuation
as of December 31 2018 and approximately 53% of the net sales generated by the supermarkets held by IGC and
operated directly by us for the year ended December 31, 2018.

In addition, after giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC owns convenience stores valued at approximately
€13 million (including transfer taxes) and approximately €12 million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December
31, 2018, which are expected to generate approximately €1 million of rental revenues between October 1, 2019
and September 30, 2020, providing a return of approximately 8% (such return calculated as the expected annual
rental revenues from such stores divided by the stores’ valuation including transfer taxes).

_Other Operating Assets_

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC owns shopping malls and commercial areas on over 100 lots
that are primarily adjacent to stores we operate that were valued at approximately €142 million (including transfer
taxes) and approximately €132 million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December 31, 2018. They are expected to

15


-----

generate rental revenues of approximately €10 million between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020,
providing a return of approximately 7% (such return calculated as the rental revenues expected to be derived from
existing lease agreements with third parties relating to such stores divided by the stores’ valuation including
transfer taxes). The top five shopping malls held by IGC accounted for approximately 34% of the total valuation
of the shopping malls held by IGC as of December 31, 2018.

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC also owns a diversified portfolio of parking lots, service
stations and, to a lesser extent, land, for a total value of approximately €306 million (including transfer taxes) and
approximately €288 million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December 31, 2018. Such assets are expected to
generate rental revenues of approximately €2 million between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020.

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC is also the owner of 15 restaurants operating under the “À la
bonne heure” banner, valued at approximately €14 million (including transfer taxes) and approximately €13
million (excluding transfer taxes) as of December 31, 2018 and expected to generate rental revenues of
approximately €1 million between October 1, 2019 and September 20, 2020, providing a return of approximately
7% (such return calculated as the expected annual rental revenues from such stores divided by the stores’ valuation
including transfer taxes).

_Non-Operating Assets_

After giving effect to the IGC Reorganization, IGC owns stakes in real estate funds valued at approximately €67
million as of December 31, 2018, shares in joint ventures valued at approximately €26 million as of December
31, 2018 and other non-operating assets valued at approximately €21 million as of December 31, 2018.

_Value of the Real Estate Assets_

Certain independent property valuation specialists have carried out a valuation of a large part of IGC’s real estate
assets on an individual property basis as of December 31, 2018, from which all figures in the section “—Overview
_of Real Estate Assets” are derived. The valuation was prepared on the basis of certain qualifications and_
assumptions, estimates and projections. See “Business—Valuation of the Property Portfolio” and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used,_
_estimates made or procedures followed in the third party valuation of IGC’s portfolio of real estate assets are_
_correct, accurate or complete”._

**_Leases_**

In connection with the Refinancing, IGC, DCF and other Group subsidiaries within France will, on or prior to the
Issue Date, enter into a master lease agreement (the “New Master Lease Agreement”), pursuant to which all the
existing leases within the IGC perimeter with Group entities within France as lessees will be renewed and the
principal terms of such leases will be agreed. The template for such leases will be appended to the New Master
Lease Agreement.

The New Master Lease Agreement will provide that all the new leases will take effect retroactively on October 1,
2019 for a period of twelve years (of which there is a firm minimum term of nine years), and a maximum period,
if renewed, of 39 years.

The rents for each of the renewed leases will be fixed, subject to an annual revision in line with a standard annual
indexation clause linked to the change in the _Indice National des Loyers Commerciaux (the National Index of_
Commercial Leases, a reference measure that is published on a quarterly basis by the French National Institute of
Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE)) and paid on a monthly basis. The initial rents have been agreed for each
real estate asset.

At any renewal date, if the rights to the lease (droit au bail) have been transferred outside the Group, the new rent
will be, unless otherwise agreed between the parties, adjusted to reflect the rental market value of the asset at that
time.

Under the New Master Lease Agreement, the sale of the rights to the lease will be permitted to any other member
of the Group. The sale of the rights to the lease to a company outside the Group will only be permitted if such sale
includes the corresponding going concern (fonds de commerce) and will be subject to the prior written approval
of IGC, which may only be withheld if the transferee is not sufficiently solvent. In case of assignment, the assignor
shall remain jointly liable with the assignee for three years. The landlord shall inform the assignor of any default
of payment of the lessee within one month as from the date on which the due amount was required to be paid by
the lessee. The Indenture will provide that the New Master Lease Agreement may not be amended, waived or
allowed to enter into default in any manner that would adversely affect the holders of the Notes or the relevant

16


-----

lessor in any material respect. See “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Amendments of the New Master Lease
_Agreement”._

Subleases are allowed to any other member of the Group and, with some restrictions, to third-parties.

As long as DCF and other subsidiaries party to the leases are members of the Group, IGC has undertaken:

  - not to create or rent additional selling areas to another hypermarket or supermarket in the catchment area
of each store; and

  - not to sell to, transfer in any way to or enter into long-term leases (bail emphythéotique) with a competitor
of the Group (including food-retailers and real-estate companies affiliated with a food-retailer).

The New Master Lease Agreement provides that in the event of (a) an enforcement of the pledge over the shares
of IGC that form part of the Note Collateral and (b) the exercise of the termination clause, the undertakings
mentioned above shall be disapplied.

In addition, if IGC wishes to sell all or part of the leased areas, DCF and the other relevant members of the Group
will benefit, as long as it is a member of the Group, from a right of first offer and a pre-emption right.

DCF and IGC will enter into the individual new lease agreements with respect to each real estate asset before
March 31, 2020.

IGC is also party to rental agreements with third parties in respect of retail space in the shopping malls it owns.
These rental agreements reflect market practice in France. They are primarily ten-year lease agreements, whereby
the lessee has the right to terminate the lease after three or six years. Most rents are composed of a fixed
component, with an additional variable component. The leases also have indexation clauses linked to the change
in the Indice National des Loyers Commerciaux. Rental payments due thereunder are primarily paid on a quarterly
basis.

**The Refinancing**

In connection with the Offering, we intend to enter into the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement to be dated on
or prior to the Escrow Release Date in the event that the Offering is consummated prior to the date of execution
of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of at least €1.8 billion (and
otherwise on or prior to the Issue Date), among, _inter alios, CGP, as borrower, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole_
Corporate and Investment Bank, Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank plc, J.P.
Morgan Securities plc and Natixis, as mandated lead arrangers, Credit Suisse International, as agent, and Citibank,
N.A., London Branch, as security agent. The New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will provide for the borrowing
by CGP of an aggregate principal amount of €1.0 billion under the New Term Loan B Facility that will mature in
January 2024. Interest on the New Term Loan B Facility will be payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of EURIBOR
(subject to 0% floor) plus a margin. CGP’s obligations under the New Term Loan B Facility will be guaranteed
on a senior secured basis by DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. and, following the Latam Reorganization
Transactions, by Segisor. The New Term Loan B Facility will be secured by pledges on certain assets of CGP,
DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. and, following the Latam Reorganization Transactions, of Segisor
(the “Credit Facilities Collateral”). Noteholders will not benefit from the Credit Facilities Collateral. For a
further description of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—New Term Loan B Facility Agreement”._

Furthermore, in connection with the Offering and the entry into the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, we
also intend to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, to be dated on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date in the event that the Offering is consummated prior to the date of execution of the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of at least €1.8 billion (and otherwise on or prior to
the Issue Date), among, inter alios, CGP, as borrower, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse International and J.P. Morgan
Securities plc as Mandated Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as
agent, and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as security agent. The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
provide for the borrowing by CGP, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. of an initial aggregate amount of up to
€2.0 billion under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will
be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by CGP, DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. and, following the
Latam Reorganization Transactions, Segisor. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the Credit
Facilities Collateral. For a further description of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, see “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”._

We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, along with the proceeds raised in connection with the
incurrence of the New Term Loan B Facility for a principal amount of €1.0 billion and cash from our balance

17


-----

sheet, to (i) repay amounts drawn under our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, (ii) repay and cancel our
Existing Bilateral Facilities, (iii) repay, through a tender offer launched on November 5, 2019, a portion of our
Existing EMTN Bonds at the CGP level, directly or indirectly through the refinancing of certain intercompany
loans (and deposit those amounts pending closing of the tender offer in a Segregated Account), (iv) leave cash on
balance in a Segregated Account to repay, on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date, along with cash proceeds to
the France Retail and E-commerce segments resulting from the Latam Reorganization Transactions,
approximately €195 million of the Segisor Credit Facility on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date and (v) pay the
fees and expenses related to the Refinancing.

If the Offering is consummated prior to the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an
aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes
on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer.
The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee, for the benefit
of itself and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
providing for the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the execution
of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate
amount of at least €1.8 billion does not occur on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption at a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption”. If the Offering closes concurrently with or after the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility_
Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the foregoing escrow procedures will not apply, and
the Initial Purchasers will transfer the net proceeds of the Offering in accordance with the instructions provided
by the Issuer on the Issue Date.

The requisite majority of lenders under our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities have consented to the
Refinancing. Certain consenting lenders will have their commitments cancelled and will simultaneously become
lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Certain consenting lenders who have not chosen to become
lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the lenders under the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities
who have not consented to the Refinancing will stay committed under the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities
until their respective maturities.

The Offering and the entry into the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and the use of the proceeds therefrom are collectively referred to herein as the “Refinancing”.

**The Latam Reorganization Transactions**

The Group previously announced its plan to simplify its Latin American holding structure through a number of
interrelated transactions (the “Latam Reorganization Transactions”). The Latam Reorganization Transactions
involve the following main steps.

**_Tender offer for the outstanding shares of Almacenes Éxito. On October 19, 2019, CBD announced that Sendas_**
Distribuidora S.A. (“Sendas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CBD, published in Colombia the first notice of an
all-cash tender offer to acquire up to 100% of the outstanding shares of Almacenes Éxito at the price of COP
18,000 per share (pursuant to which CGP’s wholly owned subsidiary Tevir S.A.S. (“Tevir”) will tender its entire
55.3% stake, which it currently holds indirectly through various subsidiaries, in exchange for approximately
€1,194 million (based on the intraday average mid-market EUR/COP exchange rate on October 28, 2019).
Shareholders of Almacenes Éxito will have between October 28, 2019 and November 19, 2019 to accept the
tender offer. The settlement of the tender offer will occur three business days after the results of the tender offer
are communicated by the Colombian Securities Exchange to the Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

Assuming Sendas acquires 100% of Almacenes Éxito’s shares, the amount that Sendas will pay to acquire the
shares will be €2,159 million (based on the intraday average mid-market EUR/COP exchange rate on October 28,
2019). The acquisition will be financed through cash on hand at GPA and with the proceeds from the issuance by
Sendas of BRL 8.0 billion (or €1,803 million based on the intraday average mid-market EUR/BRL exchange rate
on October 28, 2019) in aggregate principal amount of unsecured debentures guaranteed by CBD, with maturity
dates ranging from one to four years from the date of issuance, which Sendas announced on August 9, 2019.

**_Acquisition by CGP of shares of Segisor held by Grupo Éxito. On August 19, 2019, CGP entered into a share_**
purchase agreement with Onper Investments 2015 S.L., a wholly owned subsidiary of Almacenes Éxito
(“Onper”), pursuant to which CGP agreed to purchase, and Onper agreed to sell, 50% of the outstanding shares
in Segisor, a French holding company of CBD, at a price of BRL 113 per share (or approximately €1,271 million
in total, based on the intraday average mid-market EUR/BRL exchange rate on October 28, 2019), approximately

18


-----

€1,074 million of which will be paid in cash, with the remainder of the purchase price paid through the assumption
by CGP of Segisor’s liabilities under the Segisor Credit Facility. After giving effect to this acquisition, CGP will
be the sole owner of Segisor. Segisor currently owns 37.3% of CBD’s share capital or 99.6 million shares. Onper
will benefit from a partial purchase price matching clause equal to 80% of the price difference on the 49.8 million
CBD shares that CGP is acquiring from Almacenes Éxito in the event of a disposal of all or part of such shares
above a price of BRL 113 per share within 15 months from the sale date.

**_Conversion of CBD preferred shares and migration to the Novo Mercado._** We further intend to convert the
preferred shares of CBD (which are currently listed) into ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 1:1 in the context
of the migration of all the outstanding shares of CBD to the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 - Brasil Bolsa
Balcão S.A. (formerly BM&F Bovespa) stock exchange, which is for the trading of shares issued by companies
that commit themselves voluntarily to adopt strict corporate governance standards. The conversion and migration
are expected to occur in early 2020.

**_Partial repayment of the Segisor Credit Facility. On or about the Segisor Guarantee Date, we further intend to_**
repay approximately €195 million outstanding under the Segisor Credit Facility, under which €399 million was
outstanding as of June 30, 2019.

Upon completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will indirectly hold approximately 41.4% of
CBD. We expect to be able to continue fully consolidating GPA and Grupo Éxito into our consolidated financial
statements following completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions. However, neither GPA, Grupo Éxito
nor their respective subsidiaries will be considered our subsidiaries for purposes of the covenants in the Indenture.
Consequently, the covenants will not restrict any actions at those entities following completion of the Latam
Reorganization Transactions.

For a summary presentation of our corporate structure following the Latam Reorganization Transactions, see
“Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”.

During the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018,
changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive 0.8% impact on our net sales and fuel sales had a positive impact
on our net sales of 0.1%. Changes in consolidation scope had a negative impact on our net sales of 1.2%, mainly
due to the disposal of loss-making stores in France as a part of our Rocade Plan. Calendar effects had a negative
impact of 0.2% on our net sales.

A description of our net sales performance by segment is below.

France Retail

On a same-store basis, our France Retail segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were
0.2% higher than those for the three months ended September 30, 2018. This was partially due to higher same

store net sales growth during the three months ended September 30, 2018, which were 1.9% higher than those for
the comparable period in 2017.

The table below shows net sales and their growth on an as-reported, organic and same-store basis for our French
Retail banners for the three months ended September 30, 2019.

**Net sales** **As-reported growth** **Organic growth** **Same-store growth**

_in millions of euros_

Monoprix .................................................... 1,054 0.5% 0.1% 0.3%

Supermarkets .............................................. 853 (2.9)% (2.7)% 0.4%

Franprix ...................................................... 359 (5.7)% (3.4)% (0.3)%

**Total France Retail ...................................** **4,591** **(5.0)%** **(3.0)%** **0.2%**

As-reported net sales growth figures for our hypermarkets, our supermarkets and Leader Price were impacted by
changes in the store network pursuant to the Rocade Plan. Franprix’s reported sales were also impacted by the
negative effect of store disposals.

Our France Retail segment continued to grow rapidly in certain high growth market segments, with food ecommerce net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 up 16.3% compared to the comparable period
in 2018, led by the extension of our partnership with Amazon. Furthermore, we registered increases in net sales
of 8.8% in the catering market segment and 8.2% in sales of organic products.

E-commerce

Cdiscount generated GMV of €940 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019, an organic
increase of 9.0% from GMV for the comparable period in 2018, driven by ongoing marketplace expansion,
monetization revenues related to B2B services and Cdiscount “shops-in-shops” in Casino stores.

The share of Cdiscount GMV generated by sales in its marketplace continued to grow to represent 39.4% of GMV
for the three months ended September 30, 2019, a 3.2 percentage point increase from the comparable period in
2018.

Monetization revenues, including commissions related to B2C services, financial services, B2B marketplace
services and revenues in relation to 3W.relevanC were 34% higher for the three months ended September 30,
2019 than the comparable period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by B2C services, especially
Cdiscount Voyages, Cdiscount Energie and financial services.

The table below shows our E-commerce segment’s growth in GMV (and the share of GMV attributable to sales
in Cdiscount’s marketplace) and net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019.

(1) Net sales including hypermarket shop-in-shop sales and technical goods sales realized in hypermarkets and supermarkets.

Latam Retail

Net sales generated by our Latam Retail segment for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were 3.0%
higher on a same-store basis and 9.6% higher on an organic basis than those it generated during the comparable
period in 2018. Latam Retail net sales benefited from a favorable currency effect of 2.1%.

As reported by GPA, GPA generated sales growth of 10.3% on an organic basis, despite a decrease in food price
inflation of 2.4 percentage points compared to the first half of 2019.

  - Assaí continued to deliver very strong organic growth of 18.4% compared to the comparable period of
2018, due to the opening of 19 stores during the last twelve months. Same-store growth came to 3.0%,
reflecting a difficult comparative base, following five years of average same store growth above 10%.

  - Multivarejo sales were impacted by the challenging economic environment in Brazil, a high basis of
comparison in 2018 (6.0% growth in gross sales on a same-store basis) and declining inflation.

Grupo Éxito recorded a further acceleration in sales growth in Colombia.

_Additional Current Trading Information_

During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Group pursued the implementation of its announced
action plans, in particular related to cost savings, rationalization of the network and development of new
businesses in France, which collectively continued to have a positive impact on its profitability.

The evolution of our net debt for our France Retail and E-commerce segments as of September 30, 2019, as
compared to June 30, 2019, was consistent with the historical seasonality of our business in France in the last
three years (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Seasonality and comparability of results”). We continued to implement_
our initiatives to improve our cash flow generation and accelerate our deleveraging through, in particular, further
reduction of our inventory levels in France as well as our asset sale program (such as through the signing of the
Vindémia disposal in July 2019).

**_Asset Disposals_**

In July 2019, we announced the completion of the sale of three hypermarkets, four Casino supermarkets and one
Leader Price store for €39 million. We also signed new agreements relating to the disposal of three hypermarkets
for total transaction proceeds of €42 million that represented net sales of approximately €76 million and a trading
loss of around €2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, and are expected to be completed at the end of
2019, after the prior consultation of employee representatives and fulfilment of the customary conditions
precedent.

On September 19, 2019, we confirmed we received an expression of interest from Aldi France in the acquisition
of Leader Price in metropolitan France. Following this expression of interest, we have entered into discussions
with Aldi France with a view to have Aldi France submit a binding offer.

On October 16, 2019, we closed our previously announced transaction with funds managed by companies
affiliated with Apollo Global Management for the sale and leaseback of 31 store properties (12 Géant Casino and
19 Monoprix and Casino Supermarkets stores) worth €465 million (net of taxes payable). The sale price for this
transaction was €341 million (of which €327 million has been received and another €14 million is expected to be
received within twelve months following the transfer of another asset, which was postponed for technical reasons;
another asset had been initially identified for sale as part of this transaction and instead will be sold to another
third party by the end of 2019 under the same conditions). We may receive up to an additional €140 million in the
future from the sale, depending mainly on the future yield derived from the monetization of the properties sold.
This variable component has not been recognized in our financial statements. We have retained a stake in the
entity holding the sold properties. The properties identified for sale as a part of this transaction were recorded as
of June 30, 2019 as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 for a value of €338 million. We expect to
continue operating the stores under leases representing annual rent of €27 million.

On October 17, 2019, we announced that we had entered into agreements to sell 20 restaurants under our À la
Bonne Heure and Coeur de Blé banners, as well as certain of our real estate properties on which our franchisees
operate 6 restaurants. The agreements signed represent a total amount of approximately €20 million and the
underlying sale is expected to be largely completed at the end of 2019.

21


-----

In addition, on October 17, 2019, we announced the signature of agreements for the sale of two Géant Casino
hypermarkets to Système U valued at €57 million. In 2018, these stores generated pre-tax sales of approximately
€64 million and a loss in trading profit of around €2.5 million.

(3) Monoprix S.A.S. is party to a revolving credit facility agreement dated July 9, 2014 among, inter alios, Monoprix S.A.S. as borrower
and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Natixis as Coordinators, providing for borrowings of up to €370 million under
the Monoprix Existing Syndicated Credit Facility, which will mature in July 2021. We intend to use the proceeds of the Refinancing to
repay amounts drawn under the Monoprix Existing Syndicated Credit Facility. The requisite majority of lenders under the Monoprix
Existing Syndicated Credit Facility have consented to the Refinancing. Certain consenting lenders under the Monoprix Existing
Syndicated Credit Facility will have their commitments cancelled and will simultaneously become lenders under our New Revolving

We intend to use approximately €525 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay seasonal working capital related drawings
made under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities since June 30, 2019 and which will be outstanding on the Issue Date.

In connection with the Offering, we intend to enter into the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement to be dated on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date in the event that the Offering is consummated prior to the date of execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
in an aggregate principal amount of at least €1.8 billion (and otherwise on or prior to the Issue Date), among, _inter alios, CGP, as_

New Term Loan B Facility will be on-lent to the Guarantors. CGP’s obligations under the New Term Loan B Facility will be guaranteed
on a senior secured basis by DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. and, following the Latam Reorganization Transactions, by
Segisor. The New Term Loan B Facility will be secured by pledges on certain assets of CGP, DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S.
and, following the Latam Reorganization Transactions, of Segisor (the “Credit Facilities Collateral”). Noteholders will not benefit
from the Credit Facilities Collateral. For a description of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements”._

In connection with the Offering and the entry into the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, we intend to enter into the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement to be dated on or prior to the Escrow Release Date in the event that the Offering is consummated prior to the
date of execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of at least €1.8 billion (and otherwise
on or prior to the Issue Date), among, inter alios, CGP, as borrower, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse International and J.P. Morgan Securities
plc as Mandated Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as agent, and Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch, as security agent. The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide for the borrowing by CGP, Casino Finance
and Monoprix S.A.S. of an initial aggregate amount of up to €2.0 billion under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under

and, following the Latam Reorganization Transactions, Segisor. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the Credit
Facilities Collateral. For a further description of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”._

(4) CGP has from time to time issued unsecured bonds within our EMTN program. As of June 30, 2019, €5,435 million of EMTN Bonds
were outstanding, including the fair value of interest rate swaps and interest rate options entered into by the Group to hedge its interest
rate exposure on the Existing EMTN Bonds. In August 2019, we repaid €675 million outstanding under our Existing EMTN Bonds at
maturity. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay, through a tender offer launched on November 5, 2019,
a portion of our Existing EMTN Bonds maturing in March 2020, May 2021 and June 2022. For a description of the terms and conditions
of the Existing EMTN Bonds, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

(5) The Notes will be the senior secured obligations of the Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Issuer, as lender, will enter into Proceeds Loans
pursuant to which it will on-lend on the Issue Date, or in the event that the proceeds of the Offering are deposited into escrow, on the
Escrow Release Date, an estimated €164 million of the proceeds of the Offering to DCF, €287 million of the proceeds of the Offering to
Casino Finance and €205 million of the proceeds of the Offering to Monoprix S.A.S. An estimated €39 million of the proceeds of the
Offering will be on-lent to Segisor on the Segisor Guarantee Date to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Segisor Credit
Facility. For a description of the Proceeds Loans, see “Description of the Notes—The Proceeds Loans”. The remaining proceeds will be
on-lent to CGP in connection with the repayment of the EMTN Notes (and will be deposited pending closing of the tender offer in a
Segregated Account).

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by (a) the Escrow Account Charge (in the event the proceeds of the
Offering are deposited into escrow, and then only until the Escrow Release Date) and (b) pledges over (i) the securities account in which
the outstanding shares of IGC owned by the Issuer are held and which, as of the Issue Date, will contain all of the outstanding shares of
IGC, (ii) all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans, (iii) the bank accounts of the Issuer and (iv) the Bond
Segregated Accounts (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”). See “Description of the Notes—Security”. The
value of the Note Collateral resides mainly in the value of the shares of IGC, which will be significantly impacted by the value of the
real estate assets which are directly and indirectly owned by IGC. As a consequence, although not part of the Note Collateral, the value
of the real estate assets indirectly owned by IGC will have a significant impact on the value of the Note Collateral. The value of the real
estate assets directly and indirectly owned by IGC is subject to change and may be impacted by many factors beyond our control,
including general macroeconomic conditions, evolution of the real estate market in a specific area and the assessment of French courts
in the case of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in France. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the
_Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—_ _The Note Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes, the_
_Notes being secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been and will be granted as security for the Notes”. For a_
description of the leases held directly or indirectly by IGC, see “Summary—The Issuer”.

(6) IGC is a company whose primary activity is the direct or indirect holding (through a number of subsidiaries) of real estate or leases of
real estate used in the Group’s France Retail operations. See “Summary—IGC”.

(7) Banque du Groupe Casino (“Banque Casino”) is a 50/50 joint venture between CGP and Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel.

(8) We currently hold a majority stake in Almacenes Éxito S.A. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Grupo Éxito”), which conducts
business in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina. Grupo Éxito’s shares are listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange.

Through (i) its wholly owned subsidiary Spice Investments Mercosur, Almacenes Éxito owns, inter alia, a 62% stake in Grupo Disco
Uruguay (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Grupo Disco”), which conducts business in Uruguay, and (ii) directly and
indirectly through intermediate holding companies, inter alia, the Devoto retail banner and the Géant banner in Uruguay. Through its
wholly owned subsidiary Onper Investments 2015 S.L., Almacenes Éxito owns (i) 50% of Segisor, the French holding company of CBD,
which is the holding company of GPA and in which CGP also owns a 50% stake, and (ii) directly and indirectly through intermediate
holding companies, the companies through which it conducts business in Argentina.

After the implementation of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, Almacenes Éxito will be indirectly majority owned by CBD, which
itself will be approximately 41.4% owned by CGP through Segisor and Tevir.

(9) As of the date of this Listing Prospectus, we hold interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito indirectly through numerous holding companies.
CGP indirectly owns 55.3% of the voting rights and 55.3% of the economic rights in Almacenes Éxito through intermediate holding
companies. CGP directly owns 50% of Segisor, a French holding company of CBD, which in turn is the holding company for GPA.
Almacenes Éxito also owns a 50% stake in Segisor indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary Onper Investments 2015 S.L. Segisor
directly and indirectly holds 37.3% of the economic rights and 100% of the voting rights in CBD. Tevir, a wholly owned subsidiary of
CGP, holds a further 4.1% of the economic rights and no voting rights in CBD indirectly through wholly owned holding companies.
CBD indirectly through certain subsidiaries holds 34% of the economic rights and 35.9% of the voting rights in Cnova, the holding
company of Cdiscount, in which CGP directly holds 64.8% of the economic rights and 63.4% of the voting rights.

As part of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, on October 19, 2019, CBD announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Sendas had
published the first notice of an all-cash public tender offer to purchase any and all shares of Almacenes Éxito, including the 55.3% of
Almacenes Éxito shares indirectly held by CGP through Tevir. In addition, CGP and Onper have entered into an agreement pursuant to
which the 50% stake in Segisor, a French holding company of CBD, held by Onper would be sold to CGP, leading to CGP being the
100% owner of Segisor. We intend to have CBD’s shares migrated to the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 - Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A.
(formerly BM&F Bovespa) stock exchange, which would entail converting CBD’s preferred shares (which are currently the shares that
are publicly listed) into ordinary shares at a one-to-one exchange ratio and aligning CBD’s corporate governance with the stricter rules
imposed by the Novo Mercado. After the implementation of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will indirectly hold
approximately 41.4% of CBD’s shares and directly and indirectly hold 78.9% of the economic interest in Cnova, and CBD will control
Grupo Éxito. Upon completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will indirectly hold approximately 41.4% of CBD. We
expect to be able to continue fully consolidating GPA and Grupo Éxito into our consolidated financial statements. However, neither
GPA, Grupo Éxito nor their respective subsidiaries will be considered our subsidiaries for purposes of the covenants in the Indenture
following completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions. Consequently, the covenants will not restrict any actions at those
entities. See “Summary—The Latam Reorganization Transactions”.

(10) Grupo Éxito’s outstanding indebtedness includes short- and long-term borrowings through credit facilities with fixed or floating interest

rates which range in maturity from August 2020 through August 2025. These facilities include revolving bilateral and syndicated
facilities as well as short-term and mid-term bilateral facilities with aggregate principal amounts ranging from €26 million to €555
million. As of June 30, 2019, Grupo Éxito had an aggregate of €1,075 million of financial indebtedness outstanding (on a pre-IFRS 16
basis and excluding the impact of IFRS 5).

(11) Segisor is party to the Segisor Credit Facility, dated June 15, 2018 among, _inter alios, Segisor, as borrower, and Crédit Agricole_

Corporate and Investment Bank, as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner. In connection with the Latam Reorganization Transactions,
we intend to use a portion of the proceeds of the Refinancing, along with cash proceeds to the France Retail and E-commerce segments
resulting from the Latam Reorganization Transactions, to repay approximately €195 million of the outstanding borrowings under the
Segisor Credit Facility on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date. See “Summary—The Latam Reorganization Transactions” and
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Segisor Credit Facility”.

(12) CBD is the holding company of the GPA group. GPA conducts business in Brazil. We currently jointly own 100% of the voting rights

in CBD with Grupo Éxito indirectly through Segisor. As a result of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will hold approximately
41.4% of the voting rights in CBD indirectly through its 100% stake in Tevir and Segisor and, directly and indirectly hold 78.9% of the
economic interest in Cnova. See “Summary—The Latam Reorganization Transactions”.

(13) GPA’s outstanding indebtedness includes borrowings under debentures, foreign currency loans and credit lines. From time to time, GPA

issues unsecured debentures to strengthen its working capital, maintain its cash strategy, lengthen its debt profile and make investments.
As of June 30, 2019, GPA had an aggregate of €1,436 million of financial indebtedness outstanding (excluding the Segisor Credit Facility
and excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and IFRS 5) and €2,333 million in off-balance sheet bank guarantees, mainly in connection with
tax disputes to which GPA was a party.

Sendas, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBD, announced on August 9, 2019 that it was issuing BRL 8.0 billion (or €1,803 million based
on the intraday average mid-market EUR/BRL exchange rate on October 28, 2019) in aggregate principal amount of unsecured
debentures guaranteed by CBD, with maturity dates ranging from one to four years from the date of issuance. The proceeds from the
issuance will be used, together with cash on hand at GPA, to finance the acquisition of Almacenes Éxito’s shares pursuant to the tender
offer launched in connection with the Latam Reorganization Transactions.

                        - general senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

                        - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and_
future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

                        - senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;

                        - guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Note
Guarantors, subject to certain guarantee limitations
described in this Listing Prospectus. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on_
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and Security Interests”;_

                        - secured by the Escrow Account Charge (in the event
the proceeds of the Offering are deposited into
escrow, and then only until the Escrow Release
Date) and liens on the Note Collateral, subject to
certain limitations described in this Listing
Prospectus. See “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law_

_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests”;_

27


-----

                       - effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent
of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness; and

                       - structurally subordinated to all obligations of CGP’s
subsidiaries that are not Note Guarantors.

**Note Guarantees ..........................................** [The Note Guarantee of each Note Guarantor will be: ]

                       - a general senior unsecured obligation of that Note
Guarantor;

                       - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and_
future indebtedness of that Note Guarantor that is
not subordinated in right of payment to such Note
Guarantee;

                       - senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness of that Note Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Note
Guarantee;

                       - effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness of that Note Guarantor that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness, including the New
Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan
B Facility;

                       - structurally subordinated to all obligations of that
Note Guarantor’s subsidiaries that are not Note
Guarantors; and

                       - contractually limited to reflect limitations under
applicable law, including limitations under

corporate benefit laws, limiting, in the case of the
Note Guarantees of DCF, Casino Finance, Monoprix
S.A.S. and Segisor, the value of such Note
Guarantees to the amount of proceeds on-lent and
not repaid to such Note Guarantors with the
proceeds of the Offering.

There are circumstances in which the Note Guarantees may
be released automatically and without the consent of the
holders of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the_
_Note Collateral—There are circumstances other than_
_repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note_
_Guarantees will be released automatically without your_
_consent or the consent of the Trustee as trustee for the Notes”._

**Security .........................................................** [As of the Issue Date, the Note Collateral is expected to ]

include the following properties and assets of the Issuer:

                       - a pledge on the securities account to which the
outstanding shares of IGC held by the Issuer are
credited;

                       - a pledge on all intragroup receivables owed to the
Issuer under the Proceeds Loans;

                       - a pledge on all of the Issuer’s bank accounts; and

28


-----

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory**

**Redemption ..............................................**



  - a pledge on the Bond Segregated Accounts.

By no later than the Segisor Guarantee Date, the Collateral is
also expected to include all the intragroup receivables owed
to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loan made available by the
Issuer to Segisor.

In the event that the proceeds of the Offering are deposited
into escrow, the Notes will also be secured by the Escrow
Account Charge from the Issue Date until the Escrow Release
Date.

For more information on the Note Collateral, see
“Description of the Notes—Security”.

The value of the Note Collateral resides mainly in the value
of the shares of IGC, which will be significantly impacted by
the value of the real estate assets which are directly and
indirectly owned by IGC. As a consequence, although not
part of the Note Collateral, the value of the real estate assets
directly and indirectly owned by IGC will have a significant
impact on the value of the Note Collateral. The value of the
real estate assets directly and indirectly owned by IGC is
subject to change and may be impacted by many factors
beyond our control, including general macroeconomic
conditions, evolution of the real estate market in a specific
area of France and the assessment of French courts in the case
of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in France. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the_
_Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—_ _The Note_
_Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations_
_under the Notes, the Notes being secured only to the extent of_
_the value of the assets that have been and will be granted as_
_security for the Notes”. For a description of the leases held_
directly or indirectly by IGC, see “Summary—The Issuer”.

The security interests in the Note Collateral will be subject to
certain contractual and legal limitations and defenses
provided by French law, as described in “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”_
and may be released under certain circumstances. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of the
_Security”._

The Offering is expected to be consummated on the Issue
Date, which may be prior to the date of the execution of the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate
amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the Offering is
consummated prior thereto, pending the execution of the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for the New
Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least
€1.8 billion, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will,
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date,
deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow
Account. Following the deposit of the gross proceeds of the
Offering in the Escrow Account by the Initial Purchasers, the
Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and
pledged on a first-ranking basis on behalf of the Trustee for
its benefit and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.
Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of a
certificate stating that the conditions to the release of the

29


-----

proceeds of the Offering from escrow are satisfied, the
escrowed funds will be released to the Issuer and utilized as
described in “The Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds”.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Release Date does not take
place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer notifies the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent that, in its good faith judgment,
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for
a New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at
least €1.8 billion will not be executed on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date or (c) a bankruptcy or insolvencyrelated default or event of default under the Indenture occurs
on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Notes will be
subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption. The escrowed
funds would be applied to pay for any such Special
Mandatory Redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes,
_the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—If the_
_conditions for the release of the escrow under the Escrow_
_Agreement are not satisfied, the Notes will be redeemed and_
_you may not get the return you expect on the Notes”._

If the Offering is consummated concurrently with or after the
execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the foregoing
escrow procedures will not apply, and the Initial Purchasers
will transfer the net proceeds of the Offering in accordance
with the instructions provided by the Issuer on the Issue Date.

**Optional Redemption ..................................** [At any time prior to November 15, 2021, the Issuer may ]

redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the redemption date plus a “make whole” premium as
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption”._

At any time on or after November 15, 2021, the Issuer may
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the redemption prices
set forth in this Listing Prospectus.

**Use of Proceeds ............................................** [We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, along ]

with the proceeds raised in connection with the incurrence of
the New Term Loan B Facility for a principal amount of €1.0
billion and cash from our balance sheet, to (i) repay amounts
drawn under our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, (ii)
repay and cancel our Existing Bilateral Facilities, (iii) repay,
through a tender offer launched on November 5, 2019, a
portion of our Existing EMTN Bonds at the CGP level,
directly or indirectly through the refinancing of certain
intercompany loans (and deposit those amounts pending
closing of the tender offer in a Segregated Account), (iv)
leave cash on balance in a Segregated Account to repay, on
or about the Segisor Guarantee Date, along with cash
proceeds to the France Retail and E-commerce segments
resulting from the Latam Reorganization Transactions,
approximately €195 million of the Segisor Credit Facility on
or about the Segisor Guarantee Date and (v) pay the fees and
expenses related to the Refinancing. See “Use of Proceeds”.

-----

**Additional Amounts ....................................** [Any payments made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes ]

will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes in
any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. If the
Issuer is required by law to withhold or deduct for such taxes
with respect to a payment to the holders of Notes, the Issuer
will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net
amount received by the holders of Notes after the withholding
is not less than the amount that they would have received in
the absence of the withholding, subject to certain exceptions.
See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”.

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons ......** [In the event of certain developments affecting taxation which ]

would require the Issuer or the Note Guarantors to pay
additional amounts, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding the date of redemption. See “Description of the
_Notes—Tax Redemption”._

**Change of Control .......................................** [Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting ]

a change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of
purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. See “Description of
_the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”._

**Certain Covenants .......................................** [The Indenture will restrict the ability of CGP and its restricted ]

subsidiaries (including the Issuer) to, among other things:

                       - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue
certain preferred stock;

                       - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                       - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make
certain investments;

                       - make certain other restricted payments;

                       - make certain asset sales, including the sale of IGC’s
real estate assets;

                       - use the proceeds of disposals of IGC’s real estate
assets;

                       - consolidate or merge with other entities;

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of CGP’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to CGP or the Issuer;

                       - repay the Proceeds Loans;

                       - carry on certain activities other than those of a
holding company;

                       - impair the Note Collateral; and

                       - amend the New Master Lease Agreement.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants”._

otherwise undertaken to, nor do we intend to, register the
Notes in the United States (including by way of an exchange

**No Established Market ................................** [The Notes will be new securities for which there are currently ]

no established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers
have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may
discontinue market-making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active trading
market will develop for the Notes.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and whose material assets as of the
Issue Date will consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of IGC and intragroup receivables owed to it
under the Proceeds Loans and, if applicable, the Escrow Account. The Issuer does not prepare, and does not intend
to prepare, consolidated financial statements at the level of the Issuer. As a result, this Listing Prospectus instead
presents consolidated financial and other data for CGP and its consolidated subsidiaries only.

The summary financial information presented below is taken from CGP’s audited consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, prepared in accordance with IFRS and CGP’s
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019 prepared
in accordance with IFRS, a free translation of which, in each case, are included elsewhere in this Listing
Prospectus.

CGP’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 were subject
to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors for those years. CGP’s
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were
subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors for
such period.

The summary financial information presented below also presents unaudited financial information of CGP for the
twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019 which was calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 –
Leases, to the audited consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from
the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, and subtracting the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2018, excluding
the impact of IFRS 16 – Leases, but restated to reflect the retroactive application of IAS 29 – Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies.

During the periods under review in this Listing Prospectus, we have adopted certain accounting standards that
may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the adoption
of IFRS 16 – Leases, IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in HyperInflationary Economies and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. We have applied each of these standards with limited
retroactive effect and as a result, our financial statements may not be directly comparable between periods. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

In connection with our adoption of IFRS 15, we changed the presentation of the income statement appearing in
our consolidated financial statements beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018, with a restated presentation of the comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017. We did not, however, republish our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
December 31, 2017 (which include a presentation of comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016). To facilitate the review of these periods and present our financial information in a
comparable manner:

  - where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the ended December 31, 2018, we present such income statement information
for the year ended December 31, 2017 restated for IFRS 15; and

  - where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the year ended December 31, 2016, we present such income statement
information for the year ended December 31, 2017 excluding the retrospective application of IFRS 15 as
it appears in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of
our financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019, we applied the full retrospective
transition approach and have restated all comparative information for the prior comparative period in accordance
with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. We have not, however, restated
our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 presented in this Listing
Prospectus to give effect to IFRS 16.

Our discussion of our results of operations from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018
and 2019 presented herein is on a pre-IFRS 16 basis. We also present certain non-IFRS measures on a pre-IFRS
16 basis in this Listing Prospectus. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial
_Measures”. While we will be required under IFRS to produce financial statements that give effect to IFRS 16,_

33


-----

compliance with our covenants under the Indenture, the New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit
Facility will be calculated without taking into account the impact of IFRS 16 and we only intend to comment on
our financial condition and results of operations on a pre-IFRS 16 basis going forward in reports that we provide
to noteholders.

(i) Net gain on disposal of non-current assets for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily concerned the France Retail
segment and especially disposals of Monoprix store properties in sale and leaseback transactions. Net gain on disposal of
non-current assets for the six months ended June 30, 2019 primarily concerned the France Retail segment.

(ii) The net asset impairment losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily concerned individual assets

in the France Retail segment in an amount of €28 million (mainly Franprix-Leader Price and DCF) and the E-commerce
segment in an amount of €10 million. The impairment loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly
concerned individual assets in the France Retail segment in an amount of €36 million, the Latam Retail segment (primarily
GPA) in an amount of €28 million, and the E-commerce segment in an amount of €7 million. The impairment loss recognized
during the year ended December 31, 2018 mainly concerns the France Retail segment. The impairment loss recognized during
the six months ended June 30, 2019 mainly concerns the France Retail segment and relates to the Asset Disposal Plan.

(iii) The €154 million net expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from changes in the

scope of consolidation in the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group in an amount of €72 million (including €59 million for sales
to master franchisees and acquisitions of controlling interests in other franchisees) and at DCF in an amount of €34 million,
together with related transaction costs of €19 million, partly offset by the €16 million effect of measuring at fair value the
previously-held interest in Geimex when the Group acquired control of this company. The €90 million net expense recognized
in 2017 resulted mainly from the loss of control of supermarket stores at DCF for an amount of €30 million, a net expense
related to various changes in scope at Franprix-Leader Price in an amount of €9 million, and fees of €31 million. The net
expense of €146 million recorded in 2018 resulted primarily from the reclassification to profit or loss, in accordance with
IAS 21, of foreign currency translation adjustments accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve for an amount of
€67 million. The €33 million expense recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily concerned fees related
to various projects for changes in the scope of consolidation. The expense relating to the store optimization plan in the France
Retail segment, including employee costs, store closure costs, inventory reduction costs and impairment totaled €67 million

-----

during the six months ended June 30, 2019 (of which €21 million corresponding to changes in scope and €46 million to
restructuring). Other changes in scope of consolidation mainly concern the France Retail segment.

(iv) Restructuring provisions and expenses in 2016 were recognized mainly in the France Retail segment in an amount of €207

million (including employee costs of €58 million, rent on closed stores of €25 million, external costs of €57 million and
impairment losses and scrapped assets of €67 million) and at GPA in an amount of €26 million. Restructuring provisions and
expenses in 2017 were recognized mainly in the France Retail segment in an amount of €169 million (including employee
costs and store closure costs in an amount of €113 million and store transformation costs in an amount of €54 million) and in
the Latam Retail segment (mainly GPA) in an amount of €38 million. Restructuring provisions and expenses in 2018 were
recognized primarily in the France Retail segment in an amount of €140 million (including employee costs and store closure
costs in an amount of €102 million and store transformation costs in an amount of €24 million) and in the Latam Retail
segment (mainly GPA) in an amount of €58 million. Excluding the impact of the store optimization plan, restructuring
provisions and expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were recognized mainly in the France Retail and Latam
Retail segments in amounts of €28 million and €20 million, respectively. Restructuring expenses for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 related chiefly to the France Retail segment in an amount of €49 million (including employee-related costs and
store closure costs in an amount of €41 million, and store conversion costs of €8 million) and to the Latam Retail segment in
an amount of €37 million.

(v) In 2016, provisions and expenses for litigation and risks were recognized at GPA in an amount of €106 million, mainly
covering tax risks. Provisions and expenses for litigation and risks represented a net expense of €84 million in 2018, including
€35 million for tax risks at GPA. The net expense of €92 million in 2017 included €60 million for the tax amnesty programs
in which GPA participated during the period. Provisions and expenses for litigation and risks represented a net expense of
€43 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, including €24 million for tax risks at GPA. In the six months ended June
30, 2018, the net expense of €16 million was recognized primarily in the France Retail and Latam Retail segments in the
amounts of €6 million and €8 million, respectively.

(vi) The net expense for 2016 included €43 million related to the 2015 tax on retail space (“TaSCom”) payable in France.

Following the introduction of new tax rules which led to a change in the period in which this levy is recognized, the TaSCom
due for 2015 was recognized in full at the beginning of 2016 in Other operating expenses and the TaSCom for 2016 was
recognized on a straight line basis over the year in Trading profit.

(b) Including BRL 288 million (€75 million) of cumulative Program of Social Integration (“PIS”) and Contribution for the Financing
of Social Security (“COFINS”) tax credits recognized in 2016 as a deduction from “Cost of goods sold” in the accounts of GPA
(of which €68 million related to prior years) after all the conditions supporting their recognition and future use were fulfilled during
the year.

(c) Of which BRL 723 million (€201 million) for the Imposto Sobre Operações Relativas à Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços de
Transporte Interestadual de Intermunicipal e de Comunicações, or Tax on Circulation of Goods and Services for Interstate and
Intercity Transportation and Communication (“ICMS”) and Substituição Tributária, or Tax Substitution (“ST”) tax credits dating
back prior to November 2016 and recognized by GPA during the year as a deduction from “Cost of goods sold”. The tax credits
were recognized following the publication in April 2017 of the agreement for the enforcement of the October 2016 ruling by
Brazil’s supreme federal court stipulating that the ICMS-ST tax is not a final tax and should not therefore be included in the basis
of assessment of PIS and COFINS taxes, allowing GPA to apply for a refund from the Brazilian state administrations. Recognition
of the pre-November 2016 ICMS-ST tax credits of Sendas Distribution (a subsidiary of GPA), in the amount of BRL 369 million
(€102 million), had no impact on the consolidated income statement because they are not expected to be recovered and were written
down in full.

(d) Of which BRL 481 million (€111 million) in respect of tax credits recognized by GPA during the period (mainly reversal of the
valuation allowance on Assaí’s ICMS-ST tax credit following a change in the law, as described above).

(e) Of which BRL 414 million (€100 million) recognized in respect of tax credits by GPA during the period (mainly reversal of the
valuation allowance on Assaí’s ICMS-ST tax credit following a change in the law, as described above).

(6) Underlying net profit/(loss), Group share corresponds to net profit from continuing operations, adjusted for (i) the impact of other
operating income and expenses, (ii) the impact of non-recurring financial items and (iii) income tax expense/benefit related to these
adjustments. Non-recurring financial items consist of changes in the fair value of equity derivatives (such as total return swaps and
forward contracts on CBD shares) and the effects of discounting tax liabilities in Brazil.

Minority interests in underlying profit represent the share of underlying net profit attributable to non-controlling interests. This indicator
is therefore equal to net profit from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for non-controlling interests
in other operating income and expenses and the impact of non-recurring financial items, as well as income tax expense/benefits related
to these adjustments. The Group uses these indicators to measure changes in recurring profit from operations.

2019 on the Existing EMTN Bonds that we estimate will remain outstanding after giving effect to the Refinancing, as if they were
applicable for the entire period. In calculating as adjusted interest expense, we have assumed: (a) that holders of (i) approximately 50%
in outstanding principal amount of our 2020 EMTN Bonds will tender, (ii) approximately 50% in outstanding principal amount of our

the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement; and (d) no drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility during the period. As adjusted
interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest payments would have
actually been had the Refinancing occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest payments for any future period
or our financial condition at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with other information provided to you in this Listing Prospectus, in deciding whether to invest in the_
_Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below, individually or together, could materially adversely_
_affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If these events occur, the trading_
_prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay any or part of the interest or principal on the_
_Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now_
_deem immaterial could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects_
_or our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes, which in turn would affect your investment in the Notes._

_This Listing Prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might_
_cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements”._

**Risks Related to our Business and Industry**

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and rapidly evolving markets, and our business and financial_**
**_results may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive_**
**_pressures._**

Our competition generally includes international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers (generalist grocers,
supermarket chains, discount retailers, specialists and convenience stores). Our competitors generally compete
with us on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, product variety, brand reputation and store
condition.

In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others:

  - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our markets,
or consolidation of existing operators;

  - potential creation by competitors of new store formats or e-commerce platforms that customers may
prefer;

  - the risk of our competitors adopting our business model in their own stores; and

  - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as discount retailers.

The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing and promotions, product mix or other business
strategies, and our response to address competition, may cause us to experience lower sales revenue, higher
operating expenses and/or lower profit margins. Moreover, to a more limited extent, our own similarly-positioned
brands and banners may compete with one another for customers.

The expansion of online sales channels, both by existing market participants and new entrants, has further
intensified the competitive dynamics of our industry and we expect this trend to continue. In our international
operations, we are a leader in most of the markets in which we operate. Our competitors in these markets include
international and local retailers, including cash & carry operators and hard discount retailers, seeking to strengthen
their positions. We monitor the competitive environment of our markets and their trends at a country and banner
level in the short term through adjusting our pricing and carrying out promotional or loyalty campaigns. In the
medium term, we also monitor our mix of formats and banners and seek out opportunities to increase multichannel sales. We also seek to identify and execute asset development, franchise transactions or purchase and sale
transactions by strategically identifying and developing store formats and banners tailored to the different
locations in which they operate. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in preventing our
competitors from making significant inroads in our markets at our expense.

Our pure e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, and, to a lesser extent, our brick-and-mortar banners, most of which
have e-commerce operations, also face intense competition from both other e-commerce providers and brick-andmortar retailers with e-commerce operations. Online retailers such as Amazon may have more experience and
greater resources than we do and may be able to offer products at more attractive prices than we can. Retailers are
increasingly introducing internet distribution platforms. Barriers to entry for e-commerce are low, and current and
new competitors can launch new e-commerce platforms at a relatively low cost by using commercially available
software or partnering with any of a number of successful e-commerce companies. In addition, a significant
amount of Cdiscount’s business relies on its ability to attract both customers and sellers to use its marketplace.

47


-----

We expect competition on online channels to continue to intensify and as a result, we may experience pricing
pressure and loss of market share.

There can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with our competitors or that new competitors will
not enter the industry. Even in geographies in which we have a particularly strong retail presence, such as the
Paris region, we face the risk that new retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing
pressure. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices,
lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities
and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We are exposed to economic and other trends that could adversely impact our operations._**

Demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and their
impact on consumer spending. A global economic downturn that impacts any of the countries in which we do
business may adversely affect consumer confidence and demand for non-essential goods such as those sold by
Monoprix, Cdiscount and our Latam Retail banners. A global economic downturn may also have an adverse
impact on the sale of food and other non-discretionary items as consumers may reduce the overall amount they
spend, by purchasing more entry-level products and/or shopping at stores operating under lower-cost formats,
such as cash & carry or hard discount stores. Even when consumers switch to our banners operating under such
formats, entry-level products and banners with a low-price positioning tend to be structurally less profitable. As a
result, our profitability may be adversely impacted if the mix of formats generating our sales changes significantly
as a result of economic conditions.

Moreover, our businesses are concentrated in France and a limited number of countries in Latin America,
increasing our exposure to unfavorable macroeconomic developments affecting those countries. For example,
73% of our stores were located in France as of June 30, 2019 and consequently, any deterioration in the French
or European economy could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial
condition. According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Institut national de la
_statistique et des études économiques, or_ INSEE), French GDP grew at only 1.7% in 2018, 2.3%, in 2017 and
1.1% in 2016. In Europe more generally, the macro-financial outlook has been recently influenced by external
factors such as the weaker and maturing global economic cycle, the greater uncertainty associated with global
trade tensions and the risks that such tensions pose on economic growth and global stability. Economic activity
and financial stability in Europe could also be affected by the monetary policy normalization that the European
Central Bank is expected to continue implementing. Economic activity remains dependent on highly
accommodative macroeconomic policies and is subject to downside risks. The implementation of policies that are
perceived to be less consumer-friendly may restrict economic recovery. In addition, political developments in the
European Union (the “EU”), including future integration or withdrawal of European countries in the EU, such as
Brexit, or changes in the economic policy, executive authority or composition of the EU and its institutions, may
have an adverse effect on the overall economic stability of the EU and the European countries in which our assets
and operations are located. Furthermore, potential EU instability may have important consequences on our ability
to obtain supplies from other EU countries at reasonable costs. Political, economic, regulatory or administrative
developments in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Latin American economies have also historically been subject to swings in economic activity, including for
example, Brazil, where the economy experienced an economic downturn in 2015 and 2016 and nearly slipped into
recession this year, and in Argentina, which the Group has qualified as a hyperinflationary economy.

Our net sales and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending which is influenced by
the cyclical nature of the general economy, levels of unemployment, population demographics, inflation or
deflation, real disposable income, VAT increases, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit and consumer
perception of overall economic conditions and their own economic prospects, all of which are factors beyond our
control. For example, these factors may make it more difficult to increase prices or may result in decreased footfall
of our stores if we do. Unfavorable economic conditions or uncertain economic or political outlook in one or more
of the principal markets in which we operate or will operate in the future could significantly adversely affect our
net sales, growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or ability to implement our strategic decisions.

**_Our business is very seasonal in nature, and our net sales, working capital requirements and operating_**
**_results may vary quarter to quarter as a result._**

The Indenture will require us to provide certain financial information to bondholders on a quarterly, semi-annual
and annual basis. Our sales, profits, working capital requirements and cash flows within any given year have
historically been affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, sales volumes have historically been significantly

48


-----

higher in December in the run-up to the holiday season. In addition, the net sales that we generate from the sale
of non-essential goods, especially through our Cdiscount business, is subject to promotional peaks, such as Black
Friday, or the biannual sales seasons in France. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our earnings,
and fluctuations in our inventory or store closings during these peak periods can affect our working capital
requirements. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly
as a result of other factors, including the timing of new store openings, temporary or definitive closings or
disposals, and the net sales contributed by new stores or the loss of net sales from closed or sold stores. For these
reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may
perform in the future. For a further discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Seasonality and comparability of results”._

**_Sales of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences._**

The success of our business depends on the continued appeal of the range of products we offer through our network
of stores, franchises and online operations. Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we
must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences which can differ in each of the
countries in which we operate and across each of our different formats. In addition, demand for our food products
could be affected by consumers’ increasing concern regarding food safety, health and wellness with respect to the
food products they buy, such as consumers’ increasing focus on the health effects of certain ingredients such as
trans fats, gluten, sugar, processed wheat or other product attributes. Customers have also shown increasing
preference for organic products, environmentally-friendly product packaging and purchases from local business.
Further, our customers increasingly expect a seamless multi-channel experience and when making a decision to
purchase products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever before,
including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Customers also expect to be able to
interact in a variety of ways, such as through mobile app purchases.

Responding to shifts in consumer preferences can entail significant costs. Moreover, we may not be successful in
accurately predicting shifts in customer preferences or demand for certain products that we offer. Although we
offer a range of different products across our various banners, failure to accurately identify or quickly and
effectively respond to changing customer preferences, demand or prevailing health or dietary preferences could
negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and our market share as
customers may avoid our product offerings in favor of alternative options. Further, if we misjudge demand for
certain products, particularly for our non-food products, we may build up excess inventory for those products,
which could result in a decrease in their sales prices and inefficient working capital management which, if
material, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our international operations are exposed to political and other business risks._**

Our international operations expose us to risks and uncertainties arising from trading in countries that may
experience or have recently experienced periods of economic or political instability, especially in Latin America.
In 2018, GPA’s and Grupo Éxito’s Latin American business accounted for 43% of our consolidated net sales.

The economies of our international markets may be more susceptible to government intervention. For example,
the Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and occasionally material, intervention by the Brazilian
federal government, which has often modified monetary, credit and other policies intended to influence its
economy. More generally, Latin American countries have also historically carried out nationalizations of
businesses they deem to be of economic importance, through expropriation, confiscation, requisition or other
similar actions. Any such intervention in any of the Latin American countries in which GPA and Grupo Éxito
operate may have a direct impact on their operations and/or more generally result in economic uncertainty and
heightened volatility. Moreover, certain regulations may create inflationary pressures on the economy, which may
lead to tight monetary policies and diminished consumer purchasing power that could materially and adversely
affect our operations. Furthermore, periods of political uncertainty, such as during presidential elections, may
further reduce purchases and consumption.

GPA and Grupo Éxito’s Latin American operations involve a number of business risks in the ordinary course of
business, such as:

- they may experience disputes with lessors of our real property lease holdings as a result of difficulties in
establishing title over land;

49


-----

- a substantial portion of the population has reduced purchasing power because it does not use banks or banking
institutions in any capacity or has limited access to credit and therefore relies on cash payments, which in
turn may delay our growth in the region; and

- e-commerce transactions may be impeded by a lack of secure payment methods.

The occurrence of these risks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Despite the fact that most of our food products are locally sourced, we face a variety of risks generally associated
with doing business in foreign markets, including:

- imposition of taxes;

- currency and exchange rate risks and exchange controls;

- risks related to labor practices and disputes;

- risks related to increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods, including product safety or
manufacturing safety standards, environmental matters or natural disasters; and

- as part of our international strategy, we enter into partnerships in markets in which we are not present, either
through licensing our banners to affiliates in international markets or through private-label supply agreements.
Any actions of these affiliates or parties to the product supply agreements could harm our brands or reputation.

The occurrence of such risks and other risks inherent in operating in and sourcing from emerging foreign markets
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial position.

**_The occurrence of unforeseen catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive_**
**_geopolitical events or natural disasters, could adversely affect retail sales._**

Unforeseen catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, war activities, floods, fires, earthquakes, sustained
episodes of inclement weather, pandemics or epidemics have a negative effect on retailers, particularly for retailers
who sell discretionary goods. Other developments, such as local strikes, boycotts, social and economic instability,
civil disturbances or similar events, could also have an adverse effect on our retailers’ operations. The occurrence
of any of these events may impact customer morale or have a detrimental impact on tourism, which may in turn
adversely affect the sales of our retail stores, many of which are concentrated in tourist destinations. The
occurrence of any such event may also generally discourage sales of food and other key consumer staples at our
retail locations or through our e-commerce channels and have an adverse effect on our operations.

For example, our retail operations and sales were recently adversely affected by the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests)
protestor movement in France. The sustained civilian protests reduced footfall to a number of our retail locations
in France that were near areas of protest. In addition, certain of our larger supermarkets and supply warehouses
were disrupted during normal hours of operation due to the high concentration of protesters nearby, which
restricted access to our properties. This event also negatively affected our working capital, with a significant
inventory build-up and resulting cash requirement. Although we were able to ultimately adjust our supply chain,
in the future, such events could prevent us and our franchisees from operating our retail locations at peak capacity
or cause disruptions to our suppliers. Any continued or resurgent social and political uncertainty may expose us
to greater risks of interruption of our operations. Our security costs may rise and footfall in our stores may suffer
as a result of any adjacent incidents of social unrest or violence. In addition, our online operations may suffer if
the third-party distributors and shippers on which we rely are impeded by protests. We cannot accurately predict
the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. For a discussion of political
risks affecting our international operations in developing countries, see “—Our international operations are
_exposed to political and other business risks”._

Prolonged disruptions of our operations due to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic
events, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance policies
in place, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage with respect
to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events and any losses that could result from
such events in the future.

**_A deterioration in our relationships with our employees, trade unions or employee representatives or a failure_**
**_to extend, renew or renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could lead to labor_**
**_disputes that might interfere with our operations or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business._**

Our business is labor intensive and maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives is crucial to our operations. The occurrence of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes could

50


-----

materially disrupt our operations or result in a loss of reputation or increased wages and benefits. As a result, any
deterioration of our relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Most of our employees in France are covered by national and company-wide collective bargaining agreements
which contain provisions that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate
employees. In addition, all of GPA’s employees and a portion of Grupo Éxito’s employees are also covered by
collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their current
terms or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or
without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions, any of which may have an adverse effect on our
business. In general, French labor law restricts companies’ ability to restructure their operations, irrespective of
whether their employees are unionized.

As is the case with most companies of our size, we have ongoing disputes with certain of our former employees
and may face related litigation in the future. We may also be affected by strikes or more significant disputes which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We face a risk of misappropriation of customer and employee data from our information systems._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information
about our customers and employees. We also rely on third-party service providers to process customer payments
made using bank cards and credit cards. Our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of
confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The use and handling of
this personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the subnational, national and international levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If we or any of our thirdparty service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if our security and information
systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if
our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result,
information about our customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we
could be subject to liabilities and penalties, damage to our reputation, litigation or government enforcement
actions, substantial costs and a loss of consumer confidence, all of which may significantly adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”)
and similar regulations, we also face the risk that customer data that we collect, including in connection with our
3W.relevanC data analytics and digital advertising business in France, as well as for marketing purposes for any
of our other businesses, may be stolen or misappropriated. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us
with their data and our business model could be negatively affected as a result. Under such circumstances, our
reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See
“Regulation” for more details on the GDPR.

**_We are exposed to the risk of theft or misappropriation of funds and products in our stores and warehouses._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to the risks of fraud, corruption and theft of products in our
stores and warehouses. For example, from time to time, products may be misappropriated during transportation
or we may experience a misappropriation of funds in our stores or at other levels of our business. We cannot
assure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will not increase in the future or that the measures we are taking
against such theft will effectively decrease inventory shrinkage. In addition to increasing security costs to combat
inventory theft, the occurrence of such risks may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and
reputation.

**_Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

The brands associated with our banners are important assets of our business. Maintaining the reputation of and
value associated with our various brands is central to the success of our business. This can be an especially difficult
task for retailers, particularly in light of the development of social media in recent years, which has led to a sharp
increase in image and reputational risks. We could be adversely affected if customers lose confidence in the safety
and quality of the products we sell or provide in our retail business.

We sell a range of private label items, which we believe are particularly important as a means of competitor
differentiation and also generally offer more attractive margins. These private label items are manufactured and/or
packaged by third parties, and while our policies set out quality and ethical standards, we do not control these
third parties or their quality control, labor or other business practices. Maintaining broad market acceptance of

51


-----

our private label items depends on many factors, including pricing, costs, quality and customer perception, and
we may not achieve or maintain expected sales for our private label items.

In light of the stringent employment, health and safety and environmental regulations to which we are subject and
the scrutiny we face from regulators, a violation, or allegations of a violation of such laws or regulations, or a
failure to achieve particular standards by any of our suppliers or manufacturers, could lead to unfavorable publicity
and a decline in public demand for our products, or require us to incur expenditure or make changes to our supply
chain and other business arrangements to ensure compliance. Any such events concerning us or any of the
manufacturers or suppliers that supply products to us could create substantial erosion in the reputation of, or value
associated with our brands and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

**_Our intellectual property rights may be infringed or challenged. Intellectual property claims by third parties_**
**_or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and_**
**_weaken our competitive position._**

We own or use intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos and domain names. We cannot be certain
that third parties will not infringe, misappropriate or terminate these rights. We own nearly all the intellectual
property rights over the trademarks, trade signs and copyrights that we use. We also own some of the intellectual
property rights over the software and technologies that we use, mainly at the Cdiscount level. However, such use
may be challenged by third parties. If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual property rights
or our use of the intellectual property rights owned by others, the value of our brands could be diminished and our
competitive position could weaken. In addition, if we are unable to renew our intellectual property rights when
they expire, the value of our brands could also be diminished and our competitive position could weaken.

In addition, our products, services, websites or other acts conducted in the ordinary course of our business may
violate, or be perceived to violate, intellectual property rights of third parties (in particular, copyrights, trademarks,
design rights, patents and software) and we may be subject to infringement claims. We may also be involved in
claims raised by third parties against our licensors, suppliers, licensees or franchisees. For example, we may be
involved in claims regarding products or services supplied by our suppliers or franchisees that are perceived as
infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.

Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us as we expand our business to include new services
and continue to develop our e-commerce channel. We may also face claims from our suppliers or licensors if they
consider that their intellectual property rights are being misused, especially where those suppliers or licensors
have a strong brand image and reputation. Our defense of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive
and time consuming, and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could
result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products and/or services. In
addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon the sale or provision of the litigious product or service,
redesign our own private-label products or acquire license rights from third parties, which could have a significant
impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products and/or health concerns in the_**
**_food industry in general may damage our reputation, increase our costs of operations or decrease demand for_**
**_our products._**

Product safety and the public’s perception that our products are safe and healthy are essential to our image and
business. Although we dedicate substantial resources, we may not be able to ensure that our customers enjoy safe,
quality products. Our sale of food products for human consumption exposes us to safety risks such as food-borne
illnesses, product contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination (including
the presence of a foreign object, substance, chemical or other agent or residue or, in certain jurisdictions, the
introduction of a genetically modified organism), spoilage, misbranding or product tampering could require
product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could result in negative publicity, temporary
warehouse closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Our reliance on third-party suppliers
increases the risk that these incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations
would be affected. These risks may also occur under any one of our private labels under our different banners.
We may be impacted by negative publicity regarding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury. We
could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or death stemming from product
contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products.

We rely upon electrical power to operate our logistics distribution centers, distribution fleets and storage facilities.
To attain maximum performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the
appropriate pre-set temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may have a material
adverse effect on our operations. However, any extended power supply shortages or interruptions could result in

52


-----

perishable food losses which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients and products are stored and
transported, are established both by statute and by us to help guarantee the safety of our food products. Our cold
chain is maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen by, our suppliers, through our
products’ transportation phase and ultimately to the time of sales in our stores or through online sales or home
deliveries. A failure in the cold chain could lead to food contamination, risks to the health of our customers, fines
and damage to our brands and reputation, each of which could subsequently affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of non-food products, including, for
example, the risks of battery explosions or choking hazards in children’s toys. If products we purchase from our
suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds
on our purchase price or obtain indemnification from them. The limited capacities of some of our suppliers may
result in their inability to replace defective merchandise in a timely manner. The reputation of our brands could
be damaged by the marketing of our products, especially in case of serious defects, such as dangerous products or
products containing harmful substances, causing physical harm or other health problems. In addition, there is a
risk that compliance lapses by our suppliers could occur, which could lead to investigation by agencies responsible
for consumer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged impact on product quality, our
business, financial condition results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

A significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in
the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand, reputation and image and negatively impact our
sales, profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in circumstances where the
financial consequences are not satisfied by one of our suppliers or covered by our product liability insurance, it
may have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we
cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue
to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Even if future product liability claims against us
are not successful, these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management’s time and
resources from operating our business.

Even if our own products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and
quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread
contamination and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply
of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns, and consumers may perceive certain
products to be unsafe or unhealthy, which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative supplies or
ingredients that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In
addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers or,
alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings. We may be unable to find
substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may not be widely available or may be
available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce demand for our products.

**_Disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

We run, directly or indirectly, an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks,
applications, websites and databases) that are essential to the operation and management of our activities. The
development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network,
applications, website and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are important
factors in our delivery of products and services to our customers under all our banners, and are especially critical
for Cdiscount’s operations, as well as our digital advertising and data center businesses, 3W.relevanC and
ScaleMax. We are dependent on our technical infrastructure and computer applications for all aspects of the dayto-day management of our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, customer delivery,
loyalty program management, data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting and consolidation, as well
as electronic data exchange and access to internal information.

The performance of the IT systems that we use depends, among other things, on our ability to effectively safeguard
such IT systems and related equipment against damage or compromise from interruptions to telecommunication
services, data breaches, hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses.
Disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future and minor
interruptions have occurred in individual cases in the past. We cannot assure protection against unauthorized

53


-----

attempts to access the IT systems that we use, including malicious third-party applications that may interfere with
or exploit security flaws in our products and services.

Any failure of such IT systems due to a technical issue or a cyberattack could have a material adverse effect on
our business operations and assets. For example, any such failure could limit our ability to complete sales. Many
of our retail stores use electronic screens to display product prices, which consumers rely upon to make purchasing
decisions. Moreover, a failure that causes our websites to become unavailable, especially Cdiscount’s website,
could materially adversely affect online product viewing opportunities and sales. If any compromise in our
security measures were to occur and our efforts to combat such a breach were unsuccessful, our operations would
be interrupted and our reputation could be harmed, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Increases in labor costs and social charges and changes to wage regulations could adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our businesses are labor-intensive. We directly employed 220,060 people as of December 31, 2018, of which
70,420 people were employed in France, 101,230 people were employed in Brazil and 37,410 people were
employed in Colombia. Consequently, our success depends in part on our ability to manage our labor costs and
its impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise our wages due to new labor laws or regulations,
pressure exerted by trade unions or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which
we operate. Furthermore, we are required to pay social security and other similar charges for our employees. These
may increase over time or the laws and regulations setting forth any exonerations or other exemptions from
payment of such charges from which we currently benefit may change, increasing our liabilities. For instance, the
tax-exempt competitiveness and employment tax credit (“CICE”) to which French companies were entitled until
2018 has been replaced since 2019 with a reduction in an employer’s payroll-based contribution, which increased
our tax base. Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to pass on such higher costs to our customers, these
higher labor costs could adversely affect our profitability.

**_We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and packaging material, as_**
**_well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel._**

Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for our products could increase our
costs and disrupt our operations. In addition, our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to
our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations. If we are unable to
pass such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand
for our products, our profitability, business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely
affected. For example, certain of GPA’s and Grupo Éxito’s Latin American operations have been subject to
government-mandated price controls on certain staple commodities which limit the prices they may set for these
offerings. As a result, the rise of certain raw material and energy costs in these markets could have an immediate
and direct material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

In addition, significant amounts of electricity and fuel are needed to regulate the temperature of and operate our
stores, warehouses, data centers and maintain our cold chain requirements for appropriate storage of materials and
products before they are sold, and we cannot guarantee that our energy costs will not increase in the future. Such
cost increases may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may conflict with your interests, particularly in light of its_**
**_ongoing financial restructuring._**

A majority of CGP’s voting stock is held by Rallye S.A. (“Rallye”), which is itself controlled by Euris S.A.S.
(“Euris”) through two intermediate holding companies (Finatis S.A. (“Finatis”) and Foncière Euris S.A.
(“Foncière **Euris”)). Euris is in turn controlled by Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer**
of CGP. In addition to Mr. Naouri, a representative of each of Euris, Finatis, Foncière Euris and Matignon Diderot
S.A.S. (“Matignon Diderot”) (another affiliate of Rallye) holds a seat on the board of directors of CGP. As of
the date hereof, the board of directors of CGP seats twelve voting and two non-voting members in total. As a
result of this ownership structure and CGP’s board composition, Rallye, its holding companies (especially Euris)
and ultimately Mr. Naouri have considerable influence over our policies, day-to-day operations and strategic
decisions. Rallye’s principal asset is the shares of CGP that it holds, nearly all of which have been pledged to
secure outstanding debt of Rallye and its subsidiaries.

54


-----

During the second quarter of 2019, each of Rallye, its subsidiaries Cobivia S.A.S. (“Cobivia”), L’Habitation
Moderne de Boulogne S.A.S. (“HMB”) and Alpétrol S.A.S. (“Alpétrol”), and Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris
entered into safeguard proceedings through a ruling by the Commercial Court of Paris. Safeguard proceedings,
which can last up to eighteen months, aim at protecting companies facing difficulties which they cannot overcome,
while not being cash-flow insolvent by giving them sufficient time to organize the restructuring of their debt and
ensure their sustainability. As from the court decision commencing the safeguard proceedings, among other
things: (i) the debtor would be prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions; and (ii) creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal
action against the debtor with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings,
if the objective of such legal action is (x) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the
creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim,
as described below), (y) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor or (z) to enforce
the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, subject to specific exceptions. For a further discussion of the
rules governing safeguard proceedings in France, see “—Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests—France”. Each of these_
safeguard proceedings was initiated after the court acknowledged the financial difficulties experienced by these
companies. On September 25, 2019, Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris met with their banking partners to
propose a draft safeguard plan, prepared with the assistance of judicial administrators, with the aim of obtaining
judicial approval of the plan by the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Each safeguard proceeding only concerns the entity for which it was initiated and as a result, none of them applies
to CGP, the Issuer or any other entity in our Group. We have therefore continued to operate in the ordinary course
of business since the safeguard proceedings were initiated. To date, these safeguard proceedings have had only
two direct impacts at the CGP level: (i) the downgrading of CGP’s credit ratings and (ii) a reduction in borrowings
under CGP’s commercial paper program, which were highlighted in an emphasis of matter relating to significant
events and liquidity risks to the Group contained in the auditors’ review report of Ernst & Young et Autres and
Deloitte & Associés referring to notes 2 and 9.5 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the public’s perception of the safeguard
proceedings could cause negative movements in our stock price and the trading price of the Notes and creditors
to become reluctant to lend to us on favorable terms or at all. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes,
_the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral— There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited”._ In addition, this could cause suppliers to tighten their payment
terms or credit insurers to reduce or suspend their coverage of our suppliers, although we have not experienced
such issues to date.

Additionally, and in particular in light of its financial difficulties and in the context of seeking to restructure its
indebtedness through the safeguard proceedings, our controlling shareholder could vote to cause us to take actions
that may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. For example, our controlling shareholder could vote
to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets, which might increase our debt service
obligations or reduce our ability to generate net sales, to distribute funds at the expense of our financial condition
or to pursue transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investment, even though such transactions
might involve risks to holders of the Notes. Noteholders could be disadvantaged by any of these actions.

**_We may not be able to implement our business strategy._**

Our future performance is dependent on our ability to identify, develop and execute our business strategy. Our
current strategy aims to pursue and strengthen our competitive position in our historical businesses’ key markets,
aim for leadership in our newer business activities, simplify the structure of our holdings in Latin America and
dispose of or reduce our stake in certain non-strategic assets and businesses. Failure to properly deploy and utilize
capital and other resources in furtherance of our identified strategy may negatively affect our planned initiatives.
Moreover, our newer business activities in the France Retail segment, GreenYellow, 3W.relevanC and ScaleMax,
are still in their development phase and consequently incurring associated development expenditures, which may
not yield the results that we anticipate achieving within a certain time, or at all. Any misjudgments or flaws in our
execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Offering a seamless customer experience by integrating innovative digital solutions and strengthening our
e-commerce channel through various means, including strategic partnerships and acquisitions of new
technologies, lies at the heart of our strategy for our business operations, especially in France. For example, in
2018, Monoprix partnered with Amazon to offer grocery items to Amazon Prime Now customers in Paris. Our
ability to adapt to e-commerce developments and, in particular, to develop web-generated sales depends on a
number of factors, including the ability to successfully market our websites, the ability to identify additional key
partnerships for the expansion of our online channels, the capability of our existing distribution network to

55


-----

accommodate our growing online operations and the ability to integrate our growing online operations on a
profitable basis. Historically, our e-commerce operations have been less profitable than our brick-and-mortar
businesses and, as a result, the expected increased weight of e-commerce operations could negatively impact our
future profitability. Moreover, we are focused on improving the customer experience by adapting to consumer
preferences for an increasingly multi-channel shopping experience, such as through in-app special discounts and
purchases. Our strategy relies on identifying and acquiring or partnering with startup businesses which offer
technology solutions that allow us to integrate innovative digital shopping processes into our operations.

The Group is also pursuing certain cost-saving measures to maintain, and reduce, its cost base through optimizing
head office expenses at the corporate level and at the level of each of our banners and reducing store costs,
continuing to negotiate better purchasing conditions for goods, realizing logistics synergies through unifying the
logistics serving our Casino, Franprix and Leader Price banners and closing or disposing of loss-making stores
through our Rocade Plan. See _“—Business—Our Strategies—Continue transformation into a less capital-_
_intensive business model with a strong focus on improving profitability and cash flow generation and proactive_
_deleveraging in France”. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed on the expected_
timeframe or at all. Further, there may be costs associated with these measures, such as potential early lease
termination liabilities associated with strategic store closings. Moreover, all or any of these initiatives may fail to
improve performance (or advance performance at a slower pace than planned) and, consequently, materially and
adversely affect the Group’s business, operating results, financial condition or prospects.

In addition, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help meet
our objectives. For example, we are currently seeking to dispose of certain assets in France. We initially announced
plans to dispose of €2.5 billion in assets by the first quarter of 2020, and as of November 7, 2019, we have signed
€2.1 billion in commitments in furtherance of that goal. We have since identified new asset disposals for a target
amount of an additional €2 billion, which we intend to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021. In executing
our asset disposition plans, we may encounter difficulties in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on
acceptable terms or in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We may
also dispose of a business at a price, or on terms, less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may
experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be
larger than projected and may have an adverse impact on our purchasing power with suppliers. After reaching an
agreement with a buyer or seller for the disposition of a business or assets, we will be subject to satisfaction of
pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and government approvals on acceptable terms, that, if
not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction on the terms initially anticipated, or at
all. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through
continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial and commercial obligations.

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot
guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may
put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing
business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may
be unable to recover our investment, which may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our success is partially dependent on new technologies being developed, especially for our Cdiscount, as well_**
**_as 3W.relevanC and ScaleMax, operations. If we do not anticipate or respond quickly enough to changing_**
**_technology or consumer preferences, or do not manage our inventory levels effectively or accurately forecast_**
**_our product returns, our operating results could materially suffer._**

Rapid and significant technological changes confront the internet environment in which we operate, particularly
for Cdiscount, which is a pure-internet banner, as well as our data and data center operations, 3W.relevanC and
ScaleMax. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our operations. In addition to our internal
technology development initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties for the development of and
access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to our online operations,
including the industries in which Cdiscount operates, will continue to emerge. These new services and
technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies that we currently use. Incorporating new
technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and
ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may
be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, or third parties’ intellectual property rights.
Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to new technological changes and
evolving industry standards.

**_We are dependent on third-party suppliers to produce our products. Our agreements with these suppliers may_**
**_be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses and have a negative impact on our profitability_**
**_and results of operations._**

We have business relations with more than 60,000 suppliers, including in relation to our private label products.
We are generally dependent on third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers
may fail to meet timelines, provide us with sufficient product or comply with our specifications. These risks are
heightened in the context of suppliers who supply and/or manufacture our private label products. If a delay or
interruption of delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able to
meet consumer demand, which may result in fewer sales. Further, as we require our suppliers to meet certain
specifications and standards to ensure the high quality of our products, the use of third-party suppliers increases
the demands on our quality control personnel. If the products provided by our suppliers do not meet the relevant
quality standards, our reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we depend on certain of our suppliers for
certain of our successful popular brand products which contribute to store traffic and sales. Any disruption of
delivery of these key high-volume products may have an adverse effect on our sales.

Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets presents risks in terms of non-compliance with labor
laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO’s
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, particularly in the context of textile and electronics
manufacturing. In addition to non-compliance with labor laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with
sourcing products from suppliers in foreign markets, including, among others, political instability; increased
security requirements applicable to foreign goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions
on imports; currency and exchange rate risks; risks related to environmental matters or other issues in the foreign
countries or factories in which our products are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of
transportation. Any of these risks, in isolation or in combination, could adversely affect our reputation, financial
condition and results of operations.

There can be no guarantee that we will maintain relationships with our suppliers, and at any point may be required
to contract with other suppliers on less favorable terms and/or at a greater cost. For instance, there is a risk that
smaller suppliers will consolidate, giving us fewer choices and resulting in increasing prices. Although we have
not experienced tightening of payment terms with our suppliers following the announcement of our parent
companies’ safeguard proceedings process, we cannot assure you that we will not face such pressure from our
suppliers. Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition of stricter conditions by
suppliers (especially with respect to stringent payment terms or as a result of the willingness of credit insurers to
reduce the exposure of our suppliers) or the non-renewal of our main supply agreements may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience a need to replace an
existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required
on terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on acceptable terms, we may
encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would take to train such suppliers in our
methods, products, quality control standards, labor, health and safety standards.

**_The efficiency of our supply chain is critical to our business and operations._**

Our businesses operate with tailored logistics structures at national levels to supply and deliver customer orders.
In each of our countries of operation, we manage the distribution of supplies to our various banners through a
logistics network. We are dependent on third-party storage and service providers for the transportation of our
products to outlets and for the delivery of our products ordered online to pick-up points or to customers. Any
increases in the cost of transportation, including as a result of increased gas prices or environmental regulations
or initiatives that mandate ecological, more costly methods of transport, could significantly increase the prices of
such services. The efficiency and functioning of our supply chain without disruptions or delays is essential,
especially for our fresh food products. Changes in our logistics structures, including as a result of labor disruptions,
delivery fleet issues, strikes, natural events, technical disruptions or occurrences of accidents, could lead to a
temporary or extended disruption of our operations, disrupt store-level product availability and in-stock
management and have a negative impact on our image and financial results.

We also face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from foreign markets, including:

- trade restrictions and the introduction of import quotas;

- the imposition of increased tariffs and customs regulations; and

- delays in shipping of products due to port strikes, infrastructure congestion, embargoes or other factors and
increased costs of transportation as a result of increased tariffs or otherwise.

**_A significant portion of our current stores are operated by franchisees and this store ownership mix presents_**
**_a number of disadvantages and risks._**

Our banners in France and in international markets have affiliate and franchise networks, including the Casino,
Franprix and Monoprix supermarket networks, the Leader Price and Surtimax discount networks, the Vival and
Spar convenience networks and the Géant, Géant Casino and Hyper Casino hypermarkets operated by affiliates.
Out of our total store network, as of December 31, 2018, 7,012 stores were operated by franchisees, of which
5,593 stores were located in France (representing 46% of the total number of stores in our network and 62% of
our French store network) and 1,419 stores are located in Colombia (representing 45% of the stores in Grupo
Éxito’s network). Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we mandate certain operational standards
and procedures through our franchise agreements, we may not be able to respond quickly enough to franchisees
that do not uphold these standards.

Our franchised operations present a number of drawbacks, such as:

  - the risk that a successful franchisee whose operations produce significant revenue or a significant number
of existing or future franchisees terminate their relationship with us or are unable to renew their franchise
agreements with us for a number of reasons, including low sales volumes, high rental costs, lack of
profitability or a desire to retire. Our franchisees may not be able to or may decide not to renew their
franchise agreements, or they may terminate their relationships with us. If a substantial number of
franchises are not renewed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected. In addition, franchisees could rebrand stores under a banner owned by one of our competitors;

  - our limited influence over franchisees and reliance on franchisees to implement major initiatives, limited
ability to change store ownership, limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy
or insolvency proceedings, inability or unwillingness of franchisees to participate in our strategic
initiatives and limitations on support of our franchisees for marketing programs and any new capital
intensive or strategic initiative which we may seek to undertake, and the successful execution thereof;
and

  - the fact that franchisees are independent operators and we cannot control many factors that impact the
traffic in their stores, which directly affect sales generated in their stores.

The actions of our franchisees could harm our brands or reputation. Any damage to our reputation, brands’ image
or brands’ name through either a single event or series of events involving our franchisees could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to market our products and attract and retain customers, which may in turn affect our
overall business, results of operations and prospects.

**_Certain of our subsidiaries are publicly listed companies and we fully consolidate them, despite the minority_**
**_interests in these companies._**

Certain of our subsidiaries are publicly listed companies, including GPA, which is listed in Brazil, Cnova, which
is listed in France, and Grupo Éxito, which is listed in Colombia. As listed public companies, these subsidiaries
are subject to rules and regulations that impose various requirements, including the requirements to publish regular
audited financial reports, and increased legal and financial compliance costs and governance requirements, such
as a minimum number of independent board members. As a result, and because there may be significant minority
shareholders in some of these subsidiaries, we may have restrictions on our ability to access or use assets, and
settle liabilities of the Group. We also hold stakes in other, non-publicly listed companies that have significant
minority shareholders. We fully consolidate GPA, Cnova, Grupo Éxito and the other entities in which we have a
controlling stake but in which there are significant minority shareholders in our consolidated financial statements.
However, because we do not fully own these subsidiaries, we may have restrictions on our ability to access to
their cash flows. To the extent that such subsidiaries will be considered restricted subsidiaries under the terms of
the Indenture, we will be able to on-lend money to any such non-wholly-owned subsidiaries in an unrestricted
manner.

In addition, activities of our subsidiaries may expose us to risks related to our internal controls and reporting. For
example, in 2016 Cnova identified material weaknesses in its internal controls in Brazil and restated its financial
statements for the years ending on December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, following an internal investigation
into accounting manipulation and internal misconduct to mislead Cnova’s auditors. Furthermore, GPA and Grupo
Éxito will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, including the provisions limiting the ability
of these entities to incur indebtedness, nor will they guarantee the Notes. As a result, they may be able to incur
significant amounts of debt that are structurally senior to the Notes. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness,
_the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—We may incur additional indebtedness in the future,_

58


-----

_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our_
_business”._

We are currently undertaking a simplification of our Latin American holding structure pursuant to which GPA
would control Grupo Éxito and its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Argentina. Upon completion of this reorganization,
we will hold only approximately 41.4% of GPA. We expect to be able to continue fully consolidating GPA and
Grupo Éxito into our consolidated financial statements. However, neither GPA, Grupo Éxito nor their respective
subsidiaries will be considered our subsidiaries for purposes of the covenants in the Indenture. Consequently, the
covenants will not restrict any actions at those entities.

**_We are engaged in joint venture and trading partnerships that we do not fully control. We cannot assure you_**
**_that those partnerships will be successful and that actions taken by our partners will not have a material_**
**_adverse impact on our business._**

We carry on a number of joint ventures, such as consumer credit joint ventures Banque Casino in France, FIC in
Brazil and Tuya in Colombia, and Reservoir Sun, GreenYellow’s solar energy joint venture with Engie, as well
as trading partnerships, such as our delivery partnerships with Amazon and Ocado. We may enter into additional
similarly structured joint ventures or trading partnerships in the future. Investments in projects over which we
have only partial control are subject to the risk that the other parties thereto, who may have different business or
investment strategies than us or with whom we may have a disagreement or dispute, may have the ability to
materially adversely affect business, financial or management decisions, such as the decision to distribute
dividends or appoint members of management, which may be crucial to the project’s success or our investment in
the project, or otherwise implement initiatives which may be contrary to our interests. Further, we are party to put
and call options on certain of our joint ventures and other businesses in which there are minority interests, the
exercise of which may result in significant cash leakage. Moreover, joint venture and other partners may be unable
or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the relevant agreements, refuse to further invest in the joint venture
or partnership if needed or may experience financial or other difficulties that may adversely impact our investment
in a particular joint venture or partnership, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. For example, we have entered into partnerships with Amazon and Ocado for
the delivery of our products in France. We face the risk that either of these strategic partners may choose to
terminate the partnership for reasons which may be out of our control, which could adversely impact our sales
and operations.

**_We depend on the services of key executives, and our business and growth strategy could be materially_**
**_harmed if we were to lose these executives and were unable to replace them with executives of equal_**
**_experience and capabilities._**

Our success depends, in part, upon the continued services of our executive management team, particularly that of
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CGP, Jean-Charles Naouri, and our highly qualified managers to
operate our business and execute our strategies. Our executives’ and managers’ knowledge of the market, our
businesses and our company represents a key strength of our business model, and our experience and human
capital serve as a barrier to entry to potential competitors. The success of our business strategy and our future
growth also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled managerial, sales, administration,
development and operating personnel. There can be no assurance that any of our key personnel will continue to
be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of one or
more of our key management or operating personnel, or the failure to attract and retain additional key personnel,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This could also
result in additional duties for the remaining members of management, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_If we are unable to renew or replace our store leases or enter into leases for new stores on commercially_**
**_acceptable terms and we cannot find suitable locations for our stores or warehouses, our growth and_**
**_profitability could be harmed._**

Most of our stores and warehouses are leased pursuant to commercial leases for fixed terms consistent with market
practices and legal constraints in our local markets. We expect that this proportion will continue to grow as we
pursue our asset-light business strategy. Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our
rental costs may increase pursuant to certain indices. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during
renewals or to renew any expired lease on favorable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our
control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, conditions in the local real estate market, competition
for desirable properties and our relationships with current and perspective landlords. For example, given the main
street location of many of our stores, we compete with a greater number of renters, resulting in increased rental

59


-----

charges for these properties. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than currently anticipated or if we
were unable to renew any expired leases on commercially favorable terms, our financial performance could be
adversely impacted. In addition, our increasing reliance on leases as a result of recent (and planned) sales of real
estate and the increasing rental expenses may have a negative impact on our business and these expenses could
increase disproportionately to our growth, if any.

Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may decide to close certain store locations
that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our brands’ positioning. Our ability to enter
into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic,
square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail
locations is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable
commercial lease terms than we can.

Moreover, in France, stores and other commercial installations whose area is over a certain threshold may require
prior regulatory authorizations from local authorities. If we are unable to secure or maintain such authorizations,
we may not be to lease new retail locations or renew leases for existing locations on acceptable terms, if at all. If
we are unable to renew our lease agreements as they expire or any of our existing lease agreements are terminated
for any reason and we are unable to secure other favorable locations on acceptable terms, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the_**
**_third-party valuation of IGC’s portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete._**

The value of the shares of IGC is linked to the value of the net assets of IGC. IGC’s main assets are its property
holdings and shares in subsidiaries that similarly own property. This Listing Prospectus refers to third-party
valuations of IGC’s directly and indirectly owned properties on an individual property basis. Property valuations,
including the ones on which the valuations stated herein are based, are prepared on the basis of various
assumptions, estimates and projections. In particular, the valuation process did not include a full review of all of
IGC’s properties or lease agreements and is thus based on a sample of physical visits over the last three years.
Some of the valuations considered included the update of previous valuations, information obtained during the
physical visits of the properties, such as number of square meters, details on the properties’ rental situations (for
example, amount of retail space and occupancy rates) and data provided by management, including the possibility
to obtain specific building permits, the properties’ financial performance (that is, their rate of return), property
refurbishment and expansionary capital expenditures, material structural issues and summary lease information.
Valuation specialists based their valuation on the assumption that IGC and its subsidiaries held good title to the
properties and that lease terms did not contain restrictive or unusual terms or any unusual, tax, environment,
planning or other restrictions associated therewith.

The valuations are based on the projected mature trading potential of our properties, including assumptions
regarding rental revenues, capital expenditure levels based on our historical and budgeted expenditure levels, or
alternative use value for a limited number of obsolete facilities that we have closed and expect to sell. Most
valuations also took into account the market liquidity of the property, along with market comparables. In addition,
as the valuation process was conducted on an individual property basis, central costs were not considered. The
third-party valuations also did not consider any potential environmental contamination, lead, radon, infestation or
other hazardous materials at the properties, which would have a negative impact on any valuations. We cannot
assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the valuation or
update are correct, accurate or complete. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions and projections
used and estimates made in the valuation, for example as a result of a new economic downturn, renewed financial
turmoil, changes in customer demand, our ability to implement our strategic plan or financial situation of our
tenants, among others.

Other appraisers may reach different valuations of IGC’s property portfolio. Moreover, the valuations referred to
herein could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the actual sale of IGC’s property portfolio,
especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Accordingly, the valuation should not be considered as a
guarantee of present or future value. The realizable value of the shares of IGC at any given time will depend on
various factors, including:

  - the level of indebtedness and other liabilities at IGC and its subsidiaries and the value of IGC’s and its
subsidiaries’ property portfolios;

  - market, economic and retail industry conditions;

  - the perception of the financial strength of the seller (for example, whether the seller is perceived to be
compelled to sell quickly);

60


-----

  - whether any additional sales are anticipated;

  - the effect any sale may have on the remaining portfolio;

  - the availability of buyers;

  - the availability of financing;

  - the time period in which the properties are sought to be sold;

  - the supply of similar properties;

  - the multiple being sought as compared to historical transaction multiple;

  - the condition of the properties;

  - the financial and operational situation of the tenants;

  - restrictions on the use of certain assets (for example, due to easements);

  - changes in regulations requiring significant capital expenditures;

  - regulatory and political risks, including obtaining any necessary consents to transferring our retail
operations; and

  - other operational cost risks.

In addition, we anticipate that the appraised value of IGC’s property portfolio will change over time, and it may
change materially. After the issuance of the Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide the Noteholders with
revised valuations and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such valuation under any circumstance.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial risks_**
**_if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate._**

We are exposed to risks that are inherent to our business operations and currently maintain insurance we believe
is customary for businesses of our size and type. For a description of our insurance policies, see “—Business—
_Insurance”. We cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to cover_
future claims or operating losses incurred as a result of accidents resulting from fires, explosions, water damage,
theft, political unrest, natural events causing damage to our property (buildings, furniture, equipment, merchandise
or computer systems) or following a business interruption at our premises, nor that we will be able to maintain
our insurance programs on acceptable terms in the future.

We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our insurance costs
may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response
to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in
general. If we are not able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost or if our
insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable in the future, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

Our insurance coverage may not cover all risks and there are some risks that may only be covered to a limited
extent due to limits in our insurance policies. For instance, we may incur losses that cannot be insured against or
that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and
management estimates underlying our reserves for such losses could result in significantly higher expense than
anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related risks may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A significant portion of our revenue
is denominated in euro, however we also generate revenue denominated in other currencies, mainly the Brazilian
real and the Colombian peso. Because our financial statements are presented in euro, the assets, liabilities, sales
and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro must be translated into euro
at the applicable exchange rates, being the spot rate for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the
average rate for sales and expenses for the applicable income statement period. Consequently, increases or
decreases in the value of the euro may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-euro businesses in
our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their own currency, and this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2018, a 10%
increase in the value of the euro relative to the Brazilian real would have resulted in a negative impact of €1,042
million on our net sales, €45 million on our trading profit, €21 million on our net profit and €590 million on our

61


-----

equity. A 10% increase in the value of the euro relative to the Colombian peso would have resulted in a negative
impact of €292 million on our net sales, €11 million on our trading profit, €2 million on our net profit and €75
million on our equity.

We also engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions from time to time. Our hedging strategies may not
adequately protect our results of operations from the effects of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations or may
limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in such rates. Moreover, we may
only have a limited ability to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk to reduce the sensitivity of our net
profits and our cash flows to currency fluctuations.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, which may not be fully realizable and may be reduced by_**
**_future impairment charges._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the excess of our acquisition
costs over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired, was €8,734 million as of June 30, 2019, or 24.6%
of our consolidated total assets on a post-IFRS 16 basis. The value of any goodwill recorded on our financial
statements may not be fully realizable upon a sale of all or part of the business or any other liquidity event.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment annually
and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse
changes in applicable laws and regulations, any changes in the key assumptions used for internal calculations of
values in use and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a
charge to our income statement. We can give no assurance that we will not record any goodwill impairments in
the future. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity
under IFRS.

**_We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, as could_**
**_the integration of the businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be negatively impacted by_**
**_merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations._**

We have in the past acquired and may in the future from time to time acquire other companies or businesses.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating
the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting
and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources from
existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies
of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired
company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue
recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which
we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees, customers and vendors from either our current
business or an acquired company’s business; inability to generate sufficient net sales to offset acquisition costs;
additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; and possible write‑offs or impairment
charges relating to acquired businesses.

Moreover, merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by the European Union and national laws and
regulations could negatively impact our business if such laws and regulations prevent us from expanding our
growth through the consummation of mergers or acquisitions in certain categories or oblige us to divest certain
stores or activities that may have an impact on our market shares in some geographical areas, especially in Paris.
For example, in the past, the Group was required to sell certain of its stores in anticipation of its acquisition of
Monoprix at the request of the relevant competition authorities. At the same time, if smaller players in our markets
are able to consolidate, this could increase the competitive pressure on our business due to an increase in such
competitors’ economies of scale and a reduction in their operating costs. Moreover, our competitors might acquire
smaller players in our markets, further strengthening their position in the market. These events could cause our
business, financial condition and operating results to be materially and adversely affected.

**_We operate in markets which have historically been predominantly price deflationary, which can put pressure_**
**_on profit margins._**

In the non-food sector, after a product is introduced, the costs associated with the product’s average selling price
typically decrease as the supply of such product becomes more prevalent in the market and new products are
developed and introduced for sale. Accordingly, as is common in our non-food sectors of operation, particularly
under our Cdiscount banner, we often expect to reduce the average price of products as a result of new product
introductions, increase in sales volume or competitive pressures. There can be no guarantee that price deflation

62


-----

may drive increased sales volume sufficiently to counteract such effects, which may make it harder for us to
maintain or grow our profit margin over a product’s life cycle.

Where the effect of price deflation is not countered by an increase in sales volume, effective cost is crucial in
maintaining or growing profit margins. If we are unable to maintain or grow our profit margins (for example, by
shifting our product mix towards higher margin products by selecting and procuring products from suppliers that
offer improved designs or preferred features), manage our inventory levels, manage costs or increase our sales
volume, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Cdiscount faces certain risks in relation to its pure e-commerce and marketplace business operations._**

Cdiscount’s operations are subject to manufacturer risks associated with its operation as a pure e-commerce
business. Manufacturers may seek to discourage or restrict the sales of goods or services over the internet. Certain
manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online sales channels. Currently, there are
a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers who refuse to sell their products on Cdiscount’s site, based in
particular on its perceived image as a discount retailer, its price positioning and/or because it does not operate
brick-and-mortar stores. Manufacturers may attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future
government regulation to prohibit or limit e-commerce in certain categories of goods or services. Manufacturers
may also attempt to enforce minimum advertised price arrangements or offer less favorable purchasing conditions
to e-commerce players than those offered to brick-and-mortar banners, which could negatively impact the
attractiveness or the profitability of our e-commerce operations. The adoption by manufacturers of policies, or
their use of laws or regulations, in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services over the
internet, could force our vendors to stop selling certain products on our platforms, which could adversely affect
our results of operations and result in loss of market share and diminished value of our brands.

**_Cdiscount’s business may be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics, or_**
**_search engine disintermediation._**

Cdiscount’s e-commerce operations depend in part on various internet search engines to direct a significant
amount of traffic to its website, from which it derives a substantial portion of its revenue. Cdiscount’s ability to
maintain a high number of visitors to its website is not entirely in its control, although it does invest in search
engine advertising (“SEA”) through the purchase of advertising and keywords from search engines and employs
search engine optimization (“SEO”) techniques. Major search engines may modify their search algorithms, and
changes in these algorithms could cause its site to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the
number of users who visit its site, as well as reduce its expected return from its SEA investment. Moreover,
competitors’ SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than
Cdiscount’s site. Negative online customer reviews could also lead search engines to down-rank Cdiscount’s site.

In addition, sites must comply with search engine guidelines and policies. These guidelines and policies are
complex and may change at any time. If Cdiscount fails to follow such guidelines and policies properly, search
engines may rank its content lower in search results or could remove its content altogether from their results. If it
is listed less prominently or fails to appear in such result listings for any reason, the number of visitors to
Cdiscount’s sites can decline, which may affect our net sales and results of operations.

**_Cdiscount is subject to risks associated with its status as a “hosting company”._**

As a provider of an online marketplace, Cdiscount is faced with unique risks associated with third-party sellers.
Despite a quality control program, Cdiscount may be unable to prevent sellers offering products through its
marketplaces from collecting payments, fraudulent or otherwise, when customers never receive the products they
ordered or when the products received are of inferior quality or materially different from the sellers’
representations. In certain instances, Cdiscount reimburses customers for payments in these situation; as it expands
its marketplace business, the cost of reimbursing customers could increase and could negatively affect operating
results. Cdiscount also may be unable to prevent sellers on its marketplace from selling goods in an unlawful
manner without licenses, permits or otherwise, or selling counterfeit products, products whose sale violates the
proprietary rights of others or products that do not meet safety standards. Moreover, many of Cdiscount’s
marketplace sellers use their own facilities to store their products, and many of them use their own or third-party
delivery systems to deliver their products to customers, which makes it difficult for Cdiscount to ensure that
customers receive the same quality of service for all products. In addition, Cdiscount could face civil or criminal
liability for unlawful activities by sellers on its marketplaces. Any of these events could have a material adverse
impact on our reputation and business.

Furthermore, the law relating to Cdiscount’s potential liability for defective products sold by third parties on its
online marketplace platform is currently unsettled. The sale of products by third parties using Cdiscount’s service

63


-----

may increase its exposure to product liability claims and even criminal liability for the introduction of dangerous
or defective products on such marketplaces. Further, the sale of defective products by marketplace vendors could
lead to an investigation by regulatory agencies. Despite our established quality control program, Cdiscount’s
reputation could be harmed if a marketplace vendor sells unlawful or unethical products.

We believe we have hosting company status with respect to our French marketplace. As a result, we believe we
are only liable for unlawful activities by sellers on our French marketplace after we have been notified of such
activities and do not take any action to remedy the situation. However, if we were to lose our hosting status, we
could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by sellers on our French marketplace even if we were
not aware of such unlawful activities.

**Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters**

**_From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration,_**
**_tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in_**
**_significant liability._**

From time to time, we and/or our management are involved in litigation, tax audits, claims and other proceedings
related to the conduct of our business, including, but not limited to, claims from our employees, claims of
intellectual property infringement, claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third
parties and environmental, health and safety claims. We could face a wide variety of employee claims, including
general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment and disability claims.

In particular, following certain speculative attacks on the share capital of CGP starting in December 2015, we
asked the AMF to initiate an investigation in 2016. In addition, as indicated in our annual report (Document de
_référence) for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed on April 1, 2019, following further speculative attacks on_
the share capital of CGP in June 2018, the Group filed a formal complaint with the AMF, asking for action to be
taken to halt the attacks and prosecute the perpetrators. In October 2018, the Group, along with its majority
shareholder Rallye, filed a criminal complaint with France’s financial Public Prosecutor on the grounds of price
manipulation, dissemination of false or misleading information, as well as insider trading, followed in November
2018 by the filing of another criminal complaint for false allegations with the Paris Public Prosecutor. To the
knowledge of the Group, these procedures are in progress. In connection with these events, the AMF has
investigated the accuracy, granularity or timing of certain financial information publicly disclosed by the Group,
regarding in particular the accounting treatment of its stake in Mercialys and certain real estate transactions, in
each case for the years 2014 to 2016. In June 2019, the Group objected in writing to a series of preliminary
assertions made by AMF investigators regarding these disclosure issues. The Group understands the AMF
investigations are still ongoing.

Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought
against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual. accounting and legal issues,
which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and legal
expenses. Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in
unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the
distraction of management resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our
reputation from case-related publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—Business—Legal
_Proceedings”._

**_We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and increased scrutiny from regulators and_**
**_enforcement authorities which could impose substantial liabilities and costs and have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent
international, national and local laws and regulations such as laws on labor, competition, imports and exports,
truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, supplier relations, urban planning approvals for the opening of new
stores, business operations, stock exchange, product safety, intermediation in consumer credit and insurance,
information technology, store safety and accessibility, occupational health and environment.

For example, as a retailer, we are subject to regulation by consumer protection authorities, such as the French
_Direction générale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes (“DGCCRF”). Such_
authorities enforce compliance with a host of consumer-related laws and regulations, including rules on
advertising style and content, the nature, composition and labelling of products supplied, legally mandated

64


-----

minimum information to be provided to consumers before they make a purchase, product safety and customer
service processes. These laws and regulations have tended to become more stringent and more expansive over
time, and enforcement has tended to increase over time.

We are also subject to regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our operational
flexibility. Such regulations are subject to frequent change, which may materially impact our business operations,
and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines. Changes in such regulations could have
an impact on our business operations. Moreover, our Group is a party to a purchasing alliance, Horizon, which
has been operational since February 2019. Purchasing alliances have recently been the subject of increased
scrutiny from the European Commission under competition laws. Competition authorities have the ability to
impose significant fines or impose limitations on the scope of these alliances for violations of competition law.

We are also subject to labor and employment laws that regulate our employees’ working conditions, maximum
working hours and, in certain jurisdictions such as France, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work
on Sundays. We may be subject to audits and/or inquiries into our labor law practices by competent authorities,
and enforcement costs can be significant.

Additionally, as a retailer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to stringent production,
packing, health, quality, labeling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and our suppliers’ facilities is
subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities,
including European, national and local health, environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, fire and
safety departments. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approvals could delay
or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution center. Our stores, our outsourced
distribution centers and our suppliers’ production facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for
compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the
traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Despite the precautions we
undertake or require our suppliers to undertake, should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered
during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut down the store, distribution center or facility concerned
and levy a fine for such non-compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Further, we are subject to various environmental, health and safety requirements, including those governing
discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the cleanup of contaminated sites, product content and labeling and
worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup obligations, fines, penalties and
other sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage, as a result of violations of our
liabilities under these requirements. For example, we own and operate service stations in France and abroad, and
as a result we are particularly subject to a variety of European directives and regulations, as well as national and
local laws, rules, taxes and regulations governing the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous
substances, wastes and other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products, and any
environmental impacts from current or historical operations at such locations. Our service stations in France are
classified facilities (installations classées pour la protection de l’environnement) and subject to regulation and
oversight relating to their use of potentially hazardous substances and other environmental impacts. Our operations
and facilities also require permits and authorizations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which
are subject to renewal, modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur
substantial capital or other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future.

Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific regulations, compliance with each of which can be
complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These include compliance with banking and personal
finance regulations by Banque du Groupe Casino in France and by GPA’s and Grupo Éxito’s consumer finance
businesses FIC and Tuya in Brazil and Colombia, respectively, compliance with e-commerce laws and regulations,
compliance with real estate laws and regulations by Sudéco and compliance with laws and regulations affecting
the solar energy sector by our GreenYellow business; subsidies for green energy in France have an impact on
GreenYellow’s results.

In addition, as a public company with shares listed in France, we are subject to rules and regulations that impose
various requirements, including the requirements to publish regular audited financial reports, and increased legal
and financial compliance costs and governance requirements, such as a minimum number of independent board
members.

From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that
governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. For instance, in 2016, the
European Parliament adopted the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, and which regulates data
protection, privacy and the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data. See “—Compliance with privacy and
_information laws and requirements could be costly, and a breach of information security or privacy could_

65


-----

_adversely affect our business”. The Latin American operations of GPA and Grupo Éxito are also subject to similar_
data protection laws. Compliance with future requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply
with any such laws or regulations could subject us to sanctions which could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations could also have an adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations.

As a general matter, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to
predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define
clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our employees may result in
noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is the case for other retailers of our size, we are subject
to inquiries and investigations from regulatory bodies, such as consumer protection agencies or competition
authorities or financial regulators, in the ordinary course of our business. Authorities may take the view that we
are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant
expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with
differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase
our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

For a further discussion of the material regulatory regimes with which we must comply, see “Regulation”.

**_Compliance with privacy and information laws and requirements could be costly, and a breach of_**
**_information security or privacy could adversely affect our business._**

A significant number of purchases across our various sales channels are made using credit and debit cards. We
also have loyalty programs as part of our marketing strategy, which allow us to gather information about our
customer base. In order for our business to function successfully, we must be able to handle and transmit
confidential information, including credit and debit card information, securely. We strive to comply with all
applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection, including those
relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with
our policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry
standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations
could adversely affect our reputation and brands and may result in claims, fines, civil or criminal proceedings or
actions against us by governmental entities or others. Moreover, even if we are compliant with such laws and
requirements, we may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data.

In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations on privacy at the international, national and state or local level
in all of our operating countries. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws
and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, which became
applicable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers
and employees increased control over their personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in fines
of a threshold percentage of our global net sales.

Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, consumer protection and the digital advertising business
are revolving and subject to potentially different interpretations. Changes in these laws and regulations or their
interpretations may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and may
present challenges to our ability to collect customer data and promote our sites, product offerings and services
through electronic communication.

**_We are exposed to changes in local regulation of credit and debit card provider commissions and payment_**
**_terms which could impose substantial costs and have a negative impact on our profitability and results of_**
**_operations._**

A substantial portion of our customers pay for their purchases with a credit or debit card. For credit and debit card
payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase and raise our operating expenses and adversely
affect our profits. For example, credit card companies in Brazil tend to impose stringent payment terms by
charging higher commissions than they do in France; they also typically settle transactions approximately 30 days
after a sale is made, as compared to the one-day turnaround that is typical for transaction settlement in France,
which can have an adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity. We are also subject to payment card association
operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or
be reinterpreted to make it difficult for us to comply. There is also a risk that information from customers’ credit
or debit cards could be misappropriated. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or regulations
may subject us to fines, the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or the
cessation of payments from credit and debit card providers to us for purchases already made. Any of these
scenarios may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial condition.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as to international tax
laws. Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position,
including our effective tax rate or tax payments, possibly with a retroactive effect.

The current incorporation into European and French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the
final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related
Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017 and ratified by France on September 26, 2018, may
increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures.

The European Union is itself pursuing its work on the harmonization of the tax legislation of the Member States.
In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive
“laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on
July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). Amongst the set of proposed measures, the ATAD
provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses would
be limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted EBITDA or to a maximum amount of €3 million, per financial
year, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions, notably in certain cases of thin capitalization. Such new
rules apply as from January 1, 2019 further to the transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French
Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) of the general interest limitation rule provided for
by the ATAD. See “—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a
_portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus increasing our taxable basis and reducing_
_the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule. The ATAD was later amended_
on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope
of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries. Article 13 of the draft French Finance Bill for 2020
issued by the French government on September 27, 2019 (the “Draft French Finance Bill”) proposes to introduce
under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and to repeal the existing French anti-hybrid legislation.
Further developments throughout the discussions leading to the adoption of the Draft French Finance Bill will
therefore need to be monitored.

Furthermore, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law as from January
1, 2019, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which
aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this
provision, the French tax authorities might ignore, for the determination of corporate income tax, an arrangement
or a series of arrangements which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes
of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine taking
into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The condition relating to the absence of genuineness of the
arrangement or series of arrangements would be met if such arrangement or series of arrangements were
established for invalid commercial reasons. This reinforces the arsenal of the French tax authorities in the fight
against abusive arrangements (without providing for specific penalties), other provisions being primarily focused
on solely tax-driven schemes.

The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including
three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”)
which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated
with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution
rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires
unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European
Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It should be
implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put
in place swiftly afterwards. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019
following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the
French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future.

Another area of uncertainty concerns the progressive decrease of the French statutory corporate income tax rate
provided for by Article 219 of the French Tax Code from 33.33% to 25% (or from 34.43% to 25.83% by taking
into account the 3.3% social contribution provided for by Article 235 ter ZC of the French Tax Code which applies
in addition to the French statutory corporate income tax rate for companies whose corporate income tax charge
exceeds €763,000) over a period of four years starting in 2019. Even though such decrease was enacted by the
French Finance Law for 2018, a new French tax bill, released by the French government on March 6, 2019 and
enacted by the French Parliament on July 24, 2019, postponed the decrease of the French statutory corporate

67


-----

income tax rate applicable to companies (together with the members of their tax consolidation group, as the case
may be) generating a French turnover exceeding €250 million for the portion of their taxable profits exceeding
€500,000 to fiscal year 2020 to address budget constraints of the French State. As a consequence, such companies
will still be subject to the 33.33% (or 34.43% including the abovementioned additional 3.3% social contribution)
rate in 2019 instead of 31% (or 32.02% including the abovementioned additional 3.3% social contribution) as
initially expected for the portion of their taxable profits exceeding €500,000. Furthermore, pursuant to article 11
of the Draft French Finance Bill, the French government proposes to review the pace of the contemplated decrease
of the French statutory corporate income tax rate for (i) 2020 from 28% (or 28.92% including the abovementioned
additional 3.3% social contribution) to 31% (or 32.02% including the abovementioned additional 3.3% social
contribution) for taxpayers generating a turnover exceeding €250 million for the portion of their taxable profits
exceeding €500,000 and (ii) 2021 from 26.5% (or 27.37% including the abovementioned additional 3.3% social
contribution) to 27.5% (or 28.41% including the abovementioned additional 3.3% social contribution) for the
same taxpayers. Therefore, the pace of the progressive decrease for large companies remains subject to
uncertainties and is likely to be amended prior the end of the fiscal year 2019.

In recent years, fiscal policy has also focused on the tax treatment of internet businesses, and the ways in which
tax laws can be adapted to tax e-commerce. This area is still unsettled and there is a risk that any of the taxing
jurisdictions in which we do business could alter their tax laws in a way that would materially increase the tax
rate applicable to our E-commerce business. In this respect, the French tax bill, released by the French government
on March 6, 2019 and enacted by the French Parliament on July 24, 2019, contains provisions on the taxation of
numerical businesses which are now subject to a 3% tax on the turnover realized in France by companies whose
portion of their turnover associated to numerical activities exceeds €750 million worldwide out of which €25
million may be attributed to French users.

Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we are located or operate or may be
located or may operate may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to our
operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on our
interpretations of French or foreign tax laws and regulations, in particular those of Brazil and Colombia, in which
we generate a significant portion of our net sales. Our interpretation of and compliance with such laws is frequently
the subject of review and inquiry from competent tax authorities. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that our
tax compliance may be frequently challenged, particularly in the above-mentioned jurisdictions. More generally,
any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we are located or operate may
result in reassessments, late payment interests, fines and penalties.

In addition, we benefit from significant tax incentives granted by Brazilian states and may obtain additional tax
incentives in the future. However, we cannot guarantee that these tax incentives will remain in force, that the
legality of these tax incentives is not, or will not in the future be, questioned by third parties such as the Brazilian
attorney general or other Brazilian states, or that we will be able to replace these incentives if they are suspended
or cancelled in the future. If these tax incentives are no longer in place, we may be retroactively subject to the
taxes (and related penalties) that were not paid in the past due to such tax incentives. For a further discussion of
other risks affecting our international operations, see “—Our international operations are exposed to political and
_other business risks”._

**_Our inability to generate sufficient future taxable profits or adverse changes to tax laws, regulatory_**
**_requirements or accounting standards could have a negative impact on the recoverability of certain deferred_**
**_tax assets._**

We recognize deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences only
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the tax losses carried
forward and the temporary differences can be utilized. As of June 30, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of €671
million. The deferred tax assets are quantified on the basis of currently enacted tax rates and accounting standards
and are subject to change as a result of future changes to tax laws or the rules for computing taxable profits and
allowable losses, possibly with a retroactive effect. Failure to generate sufficient future taxable profits or changes
in tax laws or accounting standards may reduce our estimated recoverable amount of deferred tax assets. Such a
reduction could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax_**
**_purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our financial results._**

The Council of the European Union adopted on December 5, 2017 its conclusions on the EU list of noncooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (the “Council Conclusions”) which is composed of two sub-lists
(respectively, the “Black List” and the “Grey List”, together referred to as the “EU List”). The EU List was
established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the

68


-----

Council during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions to improve tax good governance globally,
and to ensure that the EU’s international partners respect the same standards as EU Member States do. The Black
List, which shall be updated at least once a year and was initially composed of seventeen jurisdictions, is currently
composed of eleven jurisdictions (American Samoa, Belize, Fiji, Guam, the Marshall Islands, Oman, Samoa,
Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, the United States Virgin Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the
Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation
in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet, EU
Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national
level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special
documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions. A new French law that aims at fighting fraud was
published on October 24, 2018 (Law 2018-898 of October 23, 2018) and expands under certain conditions the
French tax regime regarding the non-cooperative States and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the
French Tax Code to certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List. As a result, interest paid or
accrued to persons domiciled or established in certain States and jurisdictions included into the Black List or paid
on an account opened in a financial institution located in such States and jurisdictions may be subject to
withholding tax in France and not be deductible for purposes of the computation of the debtor’s corporate income
tax liability. These new provisions apply to States and jurisdictions after their inclusion by order (arrêté) on the
list of non-cooperative States and jurisdictions as defined under Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, it being
mentioned that none of the States or jurisdictions on the Black List has been included so far.

**_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations_**
**_applicable in the countries in which we operate or intend to operate._**

We must comply with certain anti-corruption laws or other similar regulations. For example, the French law of
December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely
known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies
and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or
retaining business. We operate in certain parts of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced
widespread corruption. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with
local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance
policies and training efforts, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always
protect us from acts committed by our employees.

Further, we must comply with EU sanctions and any other applicable sanctions. Sanctions can change frequently
(and often without advance notice) and we cannot guarantee that aspects of our current business will not be subject
to sanctions in the future. U.S. sanctions principally apply to U.S. persons and, as a non-U.S. company, we are
not required to comply with such sanctions. Nonetheless, certain aspects of our business may be impacted by U.S.
sanctions that target jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Venezuela. In January 2010, the Venezuelan
governmental authorities ordered the nationalization of the Group’s stores operating in Venezuela through Cativen
S.A., which has since been renamed Red de Abastos Bicentenario S.A. (“Cativen”). In November 2010, the Group
signed an agreement with the Government of Venezuela pursuant to which we disposed of 80.1% of our share
capital in Cativen in exchange for $622.5 million, paid in installments of cash and dollar-denominated notes issued
by the Venezuelan state, the last payment of which was received in November 2011. The Group has not received
any dividend from Cativen since the signature of this agreement. In particular, U.S. sanctions against Venezuela
have targeted the Government of Venezuela, which could impact our minority stake in Cativen, which is majority
owned by the Government of Venezuela. Other than as set out above, we do not conduct any business in
Venezuela.

Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset
seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of
licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our reputation
and consequently, our ability to win future business. On the other hand, any such violation by our competitors, if
undetected, could give them an unfair competitive advantage. The consequences that we may suffer due to the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral**

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on_**
**_distributions and cash received from IGC and directly or indirectly from other operating companies of our_**
**_Group to be able to make payments on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company and conducts no business operations of its own. Its assets consist exclusively of
real estate assets in France, its shares in IGC, which itself owns real estate assets in France and shares in entities
which own real estate assets and generate lease revenue, and (as of the Issue Date) the intragroup receivables
owed to it under the Proceeds Loans and, if applicable, the Escrow Account. Payment of interest and repayment
of principal under the Notes will be entirely dependent on the ability of IGC and other members of the Group to
make cash available to the Issuer, through a combination of dividend and other distributions, interest payments
under intercompany loans (including the Proceeds Loans) and cash pooling arrangements at the Issuer level. IGC,
its subsidiaries and the other members of the Group may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their
existing or future indebtedness or by law, in their ability to make such distributions or fulfill their obligations
under intercompany loans to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. CGP and each of our
subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit
our ability to obtain cash from CGP and our subsidiaries.

While the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement
will limit CGP’s ability and the ability of our subsidiaries (including IGC and its subsidiaries) to incur contractual
restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to
certain significant qualifications and exceptions. In addition, following the Latam Reorganization Transactions,
no such restrictions will apply to the Latin American subsidiaries of the Group. We cannot assure you that
arrangements with CGP and our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and
future indebtedness of CGP and our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally (including
the results of operations and cash flow generated by the real estate assets owned by IGC and its subsidiaries) will
provide the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or payments under intercompany loans and cash pooling
arrangements to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that the Issuer does not receive enough cash from
distributions from IGC or from other payments from CGP or our other subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to
make required principal and interest payments on the Notes.

**_Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and we may_**
**_be limited in our ability to fulfill our obligations with respect to the Notes, and to use debt to fund future_**
**_capital needs._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Notes and the entry into the New Term Loan B Facility and the
New Revolving Credit Facility will continue to have, a significant amount of outstanding debt with substantial
debt service requirements. On an as adjusted basis, taking into account the Refinancing and the use of the proceeds
therefrom, the total consolidated gross debt (before the impact of IFRS 5 and without giving effect to IFRS 16) of
our France Retail and E-commerce segments would have been €6,182 million as of June 30, 2019. See
“Capitalization”.

Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of the Notes by adversely affecting
our financial position including, but not limited to:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations (after the payment of
operating expenses) to payments with respect to our other indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability
of our cash flow for changes in working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures and
other general corporate expenditures;

  - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, adverse general economic or
industry conditions;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition or changes in our business or industry;

  - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the cost
of any such borrowing or capital raising;

  - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and

70


-----

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater financial
resources.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including with respect to the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations, among other factors. Our ability to
generate cash from operations and to successfully complete our Asset Disposal Plan is subject, in large part, to
general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control.
We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or
fund our planned capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. If new debt is added to our and our
subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. See _“—We may incur_
_additional indebtedness in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes,_
_and impair our ability to operate our business”._

Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes,
including debt drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B Facility. See “—The
_Notes will be secured only by security interests over certain of our assets and will not be secured by any assets_
_that secure borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility”._

For further information regarding our substantial leverage and for more information about our outstanding
indebtedness, see also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”._

**_To repay or refinance and service our debt, including the Notes, we will need a significant amount of cash._**
**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, or our obligations under_**
**_other financing arrangements, in which case our creditors could declare all amounts owed to them due and_**
**_payable, leading to liquidity constraints._**

Our ability to make payments on principal or interest when due on our indebtedness, including the Notes, will
depend upon our future performance, our ability to generate cash and our ability to successfully complete our
Asset Disposal Plan. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. The ability of our
subsidiaries to transfer funds to us or other obligors on our indebtedness (including the Issuer), pay operating
expenses and fund planned capital expenditures and any future acquisitions will depend on our businesses’ ability
to generate cash in the future, as well as limitations that may be imposed under applicable law. This is subject, to
an extent, to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those
factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section or elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus, many of which are beyond
our and our subsidiaries’ control. Moreover, the assets that are the subject of our Asset Disposal Plan represent
cash flows that will no longer be available to us following those disposals, thereby exacerbating this risk. If we
sustain losses in the future, our ability to repay and service our debt may be materially impaired.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations and/or if we are not successful
in completing our Asset Disposal Plan, we may be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions or capital
expenditures, discontinue specified operations, obtain additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or
attempt to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms,
if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition
at such time and on market conditions. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture, will limit our
ability to pursue these alternatives. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash
to meet our obligations and could be in default under our financing arrangements. In the event of default, the
lenders under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including terminating
their commitments and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit facilities and any other
indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future to be due and payable, together with accrued and
unpaid interest. If the debt under the New Term Loan B Facility, the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes or
any other material financing arrangement that we have entered into or will subsequently enter into were to be
accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”._

**_We are subject to restrictive and affirmative debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. If we default under these_**
**_covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

The Indenture and the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will contain a number of significant restrictive
covenants that restrict some of our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities, including, but not limited to, our and
their ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

  - create or permit to exist certain liens;

  - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

  - make certain other restricted payments;

  - make certain asset sales, including the sale of IGC’s real estate assets;

  - use the proceeds of disposals of IGC’s real estate assets;

  - consolidate or merge with other entities;

  - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

  - impose restrictions on the ability of CGP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to CGP
or the Issuer;

  - repay the Proceeds Loans;

  - carry on certain activities other than those of a holding company;

  - impair the Note Collateral; and

  - amend the New Master Lease Agreement.

All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. The covenants to which
we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue
business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. Our failure to comply with these covenants,
including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Also, in addition to certain restrictive covenants, the New Revolving Credit Facility requires us and our
subsidiaries to comply with certain affirmative covenants. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_New Revolving Credit Facility”._

Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These
include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions,
we could be in default under the Notes and our other debt financings, including the New Revolving Credit Facility
and the New Term Loan B Facility. This would permit the lenders to take certain actions, including declaring all
amounts that we have borrowed under our other debt financings, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and
the New Term Loan B Facility, to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. A failure to pay
such amounts could also result in an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the Indenture or our
other debt financings or any future material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our
assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in the Issuer and its subsidiaries. Although the
Indenture, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions will be subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The terms of the Indenture will permit us to incur future
debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the
Indenture.

Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes (such as at the
level of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes). We may incur debt that shares in the Note Collateral,

72


-----

that may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes or could mature prior to the Notes. In addition,
the Indenture, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements.

In addition, we hold significant investments through minority interests in entities that will not qualify as
“subsidiaries” under the Indenture, including, upon completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, our
Latin American subsidiaries (except for Segisor). Indebtedness in such entities would consequently not be
regulated and limited by the terms of the Indenture, nor by the terms of the New Term Loan B Facility or the New
Revolving Credit Facility. Such entities could consequently incur a significant amount of indebtedness.

The incurrence of additional debt by our subsidiaries and minority investments would increase the leverage-related
risks described in this Listing Prospectus and decrease the amount of dividends available to us from these entities.
An inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and Note Guarantees.

**_If the conditions for the release of the escrow under the Escrow Agreement are not satisfied, the Notes will be_**
**_redeemed and you may not get the return you expect on the Notes._**

The Offering is expected to be consummated on the Issue Date, which may be prior to the date of the execution
of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the Offering is
consummated prior thereto, pending the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for
the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the Initial Purchasers (as defined
herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the
Offering into the Escrow Account. The gross proceeds of the Offering will be held in the Escrow Account in the
name of the Issuer but controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged in favor of the Trustee for its benefit and for
the benefit of the holders of the Notes pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of
our control. In the event that the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for the New Revolving
Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion is not executed by the Escrow Longstop Date or
upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to the Special Mandatory Redemption
provisions described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and, if
a Special Mandatory Redemption occurs, you may not obtain the return on your investment that you expect to
receive on the Notes.

**_The Notes will be secured only by security interests over certain of our assets and will not be secured by any_**
**_assets that secure borrowings under the New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility._**

The Notes will be secured only by the Escrow Account Charge (in the event the proceeds of the Offering are
deposited into escrow, and then only until the Escrow Release Date) and by the Note Collateral, which consists
exclusively of certain assets of the Issuer, including the shares of IGC, the Issuer’s cash accounts, the Issuer’s
intercompany receivables under the Proceeds Loans and the Bond Segregated Accounts. The Notes are not secured
by any real estate assets that are directly or indirectly owned by IGC.

The New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility are secured by additional assets of the
Group. Such collateral does not directly or indirectly secure the Issuer’s or the Note Guarantors’ obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture. Moreover, the Note Guarantees are unsecured. Certain of the Note Guarantors will
also be guarantors under the New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility. Such guarantors
will only grant security interests over certain of their respective assets for the benefit of the lenders under the New
Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility, and not for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Furthermore, the Indenture governing the Notes will permit us to incur additional debt that can be secured by liens
on the Note Collateral that have the same priority with the liens on the Note Collateral that secures the Notes.
Many of our assets, such as certain assets owned by our subsidiaries, are not part of the Note Collateral that will
secure the Notes. With respect to those assets that are not part of the Note Collateral but which secure other
obligations, the Notes will be effectively junior to these obligations to the extent of the value of such assets.
Holders of the indebtedness under our New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility will be
entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of their separate collateral to repay such indebtedness in
full before the holders of the Notes or any pari passu indebtedness will be entitled to any recovery from such
collateral.

The Credit Facilities Collateral includes share pledges over the shares of CPF and DCF. This may lead to
difficulties in enforcement. In an enforcement scenario, holders of the indebtedness under our New Term Loan B
and the New Revolving Credit Facility could sell the shares of CPF and/or DCF, including to different buyers.
Consequently, CPF and its subsidiaries, including the Issuer, could be separated from DCF and its subsidiaries
which could adversely affect the value of the Notes or the Notes Collateral.

**_The grant of collateral to secure the Notes might be challenged or voidable in an insolvency proceeding._**

The grant of collateral in favor of the Security Agent may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency trustee,
liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. Such events or circumstances include, among
others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties
to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the
grantor is commenced within a legally specified “hardening period” (période suspecte) following the grant.

For example, if following the Issue Date certain collateral was granted to secure existing indebtedness previously
incurred by the grantor of such security interest and such grantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy or
winding up proceeding subsequently, then any security interest in the collateral delivered after the Issue Date
would face a greater risk than security interests granted on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by
its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference
under insolvency law to secure the Notes issued on the Issue Date. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, you would lose the benefit of the security interest. In particular, in the event that the Issuer
would create additional security interests to secure the Notes after the Issue Date, those security interests would
be considered having been created for pre-existing indebtedness. If, during the judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings of the grantor of such security interests, any such security interest is deemed to have been
granted during the suspect period (période suspecte) of such grantor, such security may be set aside by the court
in the relevant insolvency proceedings. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_The Note Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes, the Notes being secured_**
**_only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been and will be granted as security for the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by security interests with respect to the Note Collateral, consisting exclusively of certain
assets of the Issuer, including the shares of IGC, the Issuer’s cash accounts, the Issuer’s intercompany receivables
and the Bond Segregated Accounts.

Although no appraisals of any collateral have been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Note
Collateral represents less than 10% of our consolidated revenue and consolidated assets. The value of the Note
Collateral resides mainly in the value of the shares of IGC, which will be significantly impacted by the value of
the real estate assets which are directly and indirectly owned by IGC. As a consequence, although not part of the
Note Collateral, the value of the real estate assets directly and indirectly owned by IGC will have a significant
impact on the value of the Note Collateral. The value of the real estate assets directly and indirectly owned by
IGC is subject to change and may be impacted by many factors beyond our control, including general
macroeconomic conditions, evolution of the real estate market in a specific area of France and the assessment of
French courts in the case of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in France. See “—Risks Related to Our
_Business and Industry—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or_
_procedures followed in the third-party valuation of IGC’s portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or_
_complete”._

The Note Collateral may also secure additional notes under the Indenture. Holders of such additional notes would
benefit from the same Note Collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your
ability to benefit from the liens on the Note Collateral. Your rights as a holder of the Notes to the Note Collateral
would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Note Collateral or a reduction in the value of the Note
Collateral securing the Notes.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes (and of any additional secured liabilities that may be
secured by the Note Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) exceed the value of the assets
securing those Notes and other obligations, those claims of the holders of such Notes will rank equally with the
claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Note
Guarantors ranking pari passu with such Notes.

There can be no assurance that the Note Collateral could be sold and, even if sold, the timing of its liquidation is
uncertain. The value of the Note Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Note Collateral in an orderly sale,
general macroeconomic conditions and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Note Collateral should
not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Note Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a
market for the sale of the Note Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in
its liquidation. In addition, the real estate assets that are directly and indirectly owned by IGC are not directly part

74


-----

of the Note Collateral and the pledge on the shares of IGC may be of no value if that entity and/or any of its
subsidiaries is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, these real estate assets are
generally leased to our various operating subsidiaries which have incurred and may incur in the future
indebtedness with different creditors. In the event such operating subsidiaries are subject to insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings, the leases in respect of those real estate assets could be canceled or renegotiated for lower
rents or assigned minimal value in the context of a restructuring of the Group. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security_
_Interests”._

If the proceeds of the Note Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, holders of the Notes
(to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Note Collateral) would have only a senior, unsecured
claim against the Issuer and the Note Guarantors.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Note Collateral._**

The Note Collateral (consisting mainly of the shares of IGC) is subject to defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of
legal perfection and other imperfections, including such defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. In addition, the real estate assets directly and indirectly owned
by IGC (which will represent a significant part of the value of the Note Collateral) are also subject to defects,
encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections. The existence of any such defects,
encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Note
Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Note Collateral.

Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section,
statutory liens or characterization under the laws of France. The security interests are also subject to practical
problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third
parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may
not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Note Collateral may significantly decrease.

Due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for
obtaining judicial decisions in France may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent
situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

**_The holders of the Notes may be limited in their ability to take enforcement action in respect of the Note_**
**_Collateral._**

The Indenture will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the right
to enforce the security documents relating to the Note Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the
Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will be barred from taking
enforcement action in respect to the Note Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the
Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of such Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

**_Investors may be required to pay a cash amount (“soulte”) in the event they decide to enforce a pledge over_**
**_securities granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Note Collateral consisting_**
**_of securities rather than by a sale of such Note Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account
or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of
the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the
sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the
secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by
way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be
deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in
the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual
foreclosure. If the value of the Note Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the foreclosed
securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of
proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent on-sale of the Note Collateral.

75


-----

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant
creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to
such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price
received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant
to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor
on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of
companies or groups of companies. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests—France—Limitations on enforcement of_
_security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)”._

**_The security over the Note Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

Under French law security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim,
unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent
_des sûretés) pursuant to Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests_
in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents pursuant to which the security interests
in the Note Collateral will be granted.

In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer (as principal obligor) toward the holders of the Notes under or in connection
with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, including pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a
claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to
enforce such security interest except through the Trustee as trustee for the Notes.

None of the Parallel Debt mechanisms constructs as set forth in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement
have been generally recognized by French courts. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has
recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère)
relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights
(especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there
can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision
should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent
benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the
risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Note Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to rely on the Parallel Debt construction to receive on the basis of such
construction any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Note Collateral. In addition, the
holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as
the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee will have certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following Defaults or Events of Default, and will act in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of
the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011_
n°10-25.533 Belvédère), that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The security documents are granted to the benefit of inter alios the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests
in the Note Collateral created for the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Note Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

76

**_Rights in the Note Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Note_**
**_Collateral and no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and the grantor of the security. The liens on the Note
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security
Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any
security interest in the Note Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely
affect the priority of such security interest against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the same Note Collateral. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither
the Trustee as trustee for the Notes nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to
perfect any of these liens.

In France, pledges over the securities of French companies in the form of a stock company (société par actions)
that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in
which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after
execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security
provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant
shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each
relevant French company. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly
registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly
registered. To the extent that the security interests are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to
the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or
similar proceeding.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Note Guarantees_**
**_will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee as trustee for the Notes._**

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be automatically released, including (without limitation):

  - in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
relevant Note Guarantor (other than CGP and CPF), to a person that is not (either immediately before or
immediately after giving effect to such transaction) CGP or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer
or other disposition does not violate the covenant described in “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales”;_

  - in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of capital stock of the relevant Note Guarantor
or any parent of that Note Guarantor (in each case other than CGP and CPF), to a person that is not (either
immediately before or immediately after giving effect to such transaction) CGP or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described in
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales” and
the Note Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other
disposition;

  - with respect to the Note Guarantee of any Note Guarantor that was required to provide such Note
Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”, upon such Note Guarantor being unconditionally released and discharged from_
its liability with respect to the debt giving rise to the requirement to provide such Note Guarantee so long
as no other debt guaranteed by the relevant Notes Guarantor would result in the requirement that such
Note Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described in “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” immediately after the release of such Note_
Guarantee;

  - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes;

  - in connection with certain amendments and waivers of the terms of the Indenture;

  - as a result of certain permitted consolidation, merger, asset sale and reorganization transactions;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture;

  - upon the sale of all of the capital stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that Note Guarantor
or any direct or indirect parent of that Note Guarantor or any direct or indirect parent of that Note
Guarantor pursuant to a security enforcement sale (including by the creditors under the New Term Loan

77


-----

B Facility Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain future indebtedness)
in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement;

  - if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Note Guarantor to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; and

  - as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement. See
“Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—Release of the Note Guarantees”.

In addition, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, following the occurrence of certain acceleration events
under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture
and certain future indebtedness which are continuing, payments in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees
will be prohibited except for certain recoveries distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the security interests in_**
**_the Note Collateral with respect to the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_consent of the Trustee as trustee for the Notes._**

Under various circumstances, the security interests in the Note Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically
and unconditionally released, including (without limitation):

  - in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or
assets constituting Note Collateral to a person that is not (either immediately before or immediately after
giving effect to such transaction) CGP or a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in “Description of the
_Notes”), if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the terms of the Indenture;_

  - upon a release of the lien (an “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the lien under the covenant
described in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” (a “Notes Lien”) so
long as immediately after the release of such Notes Lien there is no other debt secured by the a lien on
the property and assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the
requirement for the Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such lien;

  - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes;

  - in connection with certain amendments and waivers of the terms of the Indenture;

  - as a result of certain permitted consolidation, merger, asset sale and reorganization transactions;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture;

  - in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the release of
the property and assets subject to such enforcement sale;

  - in respect of a release followed by an immediate retaking in accordance with the covenant described
under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

  - as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Note Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

The Notes will only be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Note Guarantors, including, (i) as of the
Issue Date, the Initial Note Guarantors and (ii) as from the implementation of the relevant Note Guarantee, each
of the Subsequent Guarantors, as applicable. Our other direct and indirect subsidiaries, including IGC and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes.

Our non-Note Guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by
dividends, loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of,
the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of any preferred
stockholders of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of its parent. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our subsidiaries, the
creditors of any future Note Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against
such subsidiary’s assets and holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to

78


-----

payment in full of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any Note Guarantor, as direct or indirect
shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes are structurally
subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Note Guarantor
subsidiaries. Any of the debt that our non-Note Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the
Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Note Guarantees may adversely_**
**_affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees._**

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against a Note Guarantor will be subject to certain laws
applicable, and defenses available, to the Issuer or the relevant Note Guarantor, as the case may be. As of the Issue
Date, the Note Guarantors will be all incorporated under the laws of France. Future Note Guarantors may be
incorporated in other jurisdictions. Although laws may differ in these jurisdictions, applicable laws and defenses
may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Note Guarantors may have no liability or
decreased liability under their respective Note Guarantees or the security interest in the Note Collateral may be
void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_
_Security Interests”._

In France, the enforcement of the Note Guarantees is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
under the applicable laws of France, to the extent that the granting of such a Note Guarantee is not in the grantor’s
corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such
guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary
duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In France, the liabilities and obligations under the Note Guarantees are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including
any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of
Article L. 225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3,_
L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Code de Commerce and French corporate benefit rules; and (ii) a financial
limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of the Notes which the Issuer has
applied for the benefit of the relevant Note Guarantor through intercompany loans.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another
company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition or subscription of its shares. Under
French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee and, if payment had already been
made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the
court found that the guarantor did not derive an overall corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant
of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter, which must be determined on a
case-by-case basis. Based on current case law:

  - the company giving the guarantee must itself receive an actual benefit or advantage (direct or indirect)
from the transaction involving the giving of the guarantee taken as a whole which is commensurate with
the liability which it takes on under the guarantee;

  - the financial commitment assumed by the guarantor must not exceed its financial capability; and

  - (as regards group benefit, if applicable) the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being
guaranteed must belong to the same group and have real common economic purposes and policy, and
the guarantee, and the transaction to which it relates, must be entered into in furtherance of the common
economic interest of the group as a whole (not just its shareholders) and the liability under the guarantee
should be commensurate with such group benefit.

Accordingly, each of the Note Guarantees granted by a Note Guarantor incorporated in France and the amounts
recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the
Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer to that Note Guarantor or any of the Note Guarantor’s
subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested
to be made by such Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee. Any payment made by such Note Guarantor under
its Note Guarantee in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount
of the intercompany loans due by such Note Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan
arrangements referred to above. The full limitation in respect of the Note Guarantees will be set out in the

79


-----

Indenture. By virtue of this limitation, each Note Guarantor’s obligations under the Note Guarantees may be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes or a Note Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under the Note Guarantee should the portion of the proceeds of the Notes made available to a French
Note Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to zero. Although the Indenture will impose restrictions on the
ability of the Note Guarantors to repay the Proceeds Loans which are relevant in establishing the relevant corporate
benefit, these are subject to a number of exceptions.

In addition, if a Note Guarantor receives, in return for issuing its Note Guarantee, an economic return that is less
than the economic benefit such Note Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length
basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could
be taxable under certain circumstances.

Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in other jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of the Note Guarantees against the Note Guarantors. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_French insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or other_**
**_countries._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Note Guarantors, which are organized and
existing under the laws of France. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in France, the laws of which may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to
obtain post-commencement interest and duration of the proceedings.

Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in France could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the
Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Note Guarantor and the enforceability of the security
interests in the Note Collateral. The court may also in certain circumstances avoid the security interest or the Note
Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency. In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to
favor the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context
of proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or
conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and court-administered proceedings (safeguard
proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization
proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of
holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes or the Note Guarantees could be limited or suspended.
The value of the Note Collateral resides mainly in the value of the shares of IGC, which will be significantly
impacted by the value of the real estate assets which are directly and indirectly owned by IGC. In the context of
French insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings affecting us, the court may assign a lower value to the shares of
IGC and the underlying real estate assets it indirectly holds than its fair market value.

Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Note Collateral provided by the Issuer may be
adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in
respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees
and security interests in the Note Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Because the Issuer and the Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of France, you may be unable to_**
**_recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and the Note Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with registered offices or
principal place of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the
French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “Non-U.S. Individuals”). Furthermore,
most of the assets of the French Entities or the Non-U.S. Individuals are located outside of the United States.
Although the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or the Indenture, it may not be possible for holders to effect
service of process within the United States upon the French Entities or Non-U.S. Individuals. Judgments of U.S.
courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States,
may not be enforceable in French courts. As a result, holders of Notes who obtain a judgment against us in the
United States may not be able to require us to pay the amount of the judgment.

80


-----

However, it may be possible for the holders of the Notes to effect service of process within France upon those
persons or us, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The United States and France
are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral
awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state
court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would
not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France
before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings
if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that certain
conditions have been met. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_Certain covenants and events of default may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes receive a rating of Baa3 or
better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB- or better from S&P’s and no default or event of default has occurred and
is continuing under the Indenture, then, beginning on that day, certain covenants of the Indenture will not apply
to the Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective. Those covenants are
described in this Listing Prospectus under the following captions:

  - “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”;

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”;

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales”;

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted
_Subsidiaries”; and_

  - “Description of the Notes —Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only
clause (c) of the first and second paragraphs of such covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to the Notes should subsequently
decline to below Baa3 or BBB-, as applicable, the foregoing covenants and any related default provisions will be
reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be
able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, without restrictions under the
Indenture which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be_**
**_subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the
credit rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to raise new financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the_**
**_interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus increasing our taxable basis and reducing the cash_**
**_flow available to service our indebtedness._**

The French Finance Law for 2019 includes specific provisions which introduce into French tax legislation the
provisions of Council Directive 2016/1164 (the “ATAD”) regarding interest deductibility limitations in respect
of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2019.

In relation to such introduction, (i) the provisions of (x) Articles 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax Code
(i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and (y) Article 209IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the provisions of
Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been substantially amended,
as developed in more detail below.

The other rules limiting interest deductibility remain unchanged, in particular (i) the rules relating to the maximum
rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties (Articles 39.1.3° and 212-I-(a) of the
French Tax Code); and (ii) the Anti Hybrid Loans Provisions as defined below (Article 212-I-(b) of the French
Tax Code), being noted that the latter are likely to be repealed as a result of the Draft French Finance Bill whose
Article 13 proposes in substitution to introduce under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 (as defined
below).

Under Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who
are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article
39.12 of the French Tax Code, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is
fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average
rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.36% for 12month financial years ended from August 31, 2019 to September 29, 2019). Non-deductible interest pursuant to
such limitation will be treated as deemed dividend under French tax law and may in particular be subject to
withholding tax, subject to applicable tax treaties. By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the French Tax Code provides
that, in respect of a given tax year, interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of
Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the French Tax
Code or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit
institutions in similar circumstances.

Pursuant to Article 212 § I-(b) of the French Tax Code the deductibility of interest paid to a related party within
the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is subject to an additional requirement: the French borrower
shall demonstrate, at the French tax authorities’ request, that the related-party lender is, for the current fiscal year
and with respect to the concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount that is at least equal to 25% of
the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules and in accordance with the standard rate of
corporate income tax (the “Anti Hybrid Loans Provisions”). Where the related-party lender is domiciled or
established outside France, the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules shall mean that
to which it would have been liable in France on the interest received if it had been domiciled or established in
France.

In this respect, the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which amended the ATAD by, inter alia,
extending the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries, is likely to impact the Anti
Hybrid Loans Provisions following its transposition into French tax law. Article 13 of the Draft French Finance
Bill indeed currently proposes to introduce under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and to repeal the
existing French anti-hybrid legislation. Further developments throughout the discussions leading to the adoption
of the Draft French Finance Bill for 2020 will therefore need to be monitored.

Pursuant to Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-30, n° 230, dated September 4,
2019, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of Article 212 § I-b) of the French Tax Code is not to
be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Article 119 _et seq. of the French Tax Code and,_
therefore, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code.

Pursuant to Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (codified under Article 212 _bis of the French Tax_
Code), the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is now
limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its tax adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year
(corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration
net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such
entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless
of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions.

82


-----

Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that establishes eligible consolidated financial statements for
accounting purposes, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to allow additional deduction of net
financial expenses for companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity (fonds propres) over
their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated
group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are
deductible up to 75% of their amount.

French thin-capitalization rules have also been amended and apply cumulatively to the 30% Limitation, but only
to loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code and no longer to
third party debts guaranteed by such related parties. In this respect, where the amount of the related party debt of
a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5x the company’s equity (fonds propres), the deduction of net financial
expenses borne by such entity will be deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its
tax adjusted EBITDA and (ii) € 3 million per fiscal year multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of
sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French
Tax Code increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the
fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said
year. The balance of net financial expenses will be deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i)
10% of the entity’s tax adjusted EBITDA and (ii) € 1 million per fiscal year multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12
of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing
date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company
during said fiscal year. Nevertheless, the interest deductibility restriction provided for by these amended thincapitalization rules is not applicable if the borrowing company is able to demonstrate that the overall debt-toequity ratio of the accounting group (as determined under accounting consolidation rules) to which it belongs is
higher than its own debt-to-equity ratio (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year).

Financial expenses that are disallowed by virtue of the application of the 30% Limitation can be carried forward
indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion disallowed as a
result of the application of the 10% limitation will only be eligible for carryforward for one third of its amount.
The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year might also be used over the following five tax
years, but only against financial expenses incurred in those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not
available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated
groups.

The above-mentioned tax rules, as well as generally applicable tax principles, may limit our ability to deduct
interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the cash flow
available to service our indebtedness.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A substantial portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations
in interest rates, which are based on EURIBOR, LIBOR or other benchmark rates, plus an applicable margin.
These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these
obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on
the Notes. The portion of our debt bearing interest at a variable rate may further increase in the future, including
as a result of our decision to enter into market instruments such as interest rate swaps.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, several regulators and law enforcement agencies of EU Member
States, as well as the European Union itself, are conducting investigations into whether banks that contribute data
in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to
manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. Actions by EURIBOR-EBF (the association that sets the regulatory framework
for the calculation of EURIBOR), other regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the
manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the
cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could
have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
New Term Loan B Facility and our other existing and future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of
interest.

Furthermore, it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist in the future or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will
evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest
rates on our existing and future indebtedness may increase and we may need to renegotiate certain of our
indebtedness to replace LIBOR with a new standard. In addition, the issues that may lead to the discontinuation

83


-----

or unavailability of LIBOR may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to
determine. Further, there can be no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in
financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer required by the_**
**_Indenture and, if this occurs, we would be in default under the Indenture._**

Under the terms of the Indenture, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “Change of Control” as
defined in the Indenture, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of purchase. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined under our various financings,
including the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, the Existing EMTN Bonds, the New Term Loan B Facility
Agreement and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we may be obligated to prepay all or a portion of
the amounts outstanding thereunder. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds at the time of a change
of control to repurchase any or all of the Notes or repay our outstanding obligations under the New Term Loan B
Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility, or the restrictions under our then-existing contractual obligations
may not allow us to make such required repurchases. Our failure to repurchase any or all of the Notes, as
applicable, would be an event of default under the Indenture, and would cause a cross-default under our other
financings.

Except as described under “Description of the Notes”, the Indenture governing the Notes will not contain
provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization,
restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The change of control provisions contained in the
Indenture governing the Notes may not protect you in the event of highly leveraged transactions and other
important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings or mergers that may adversely affect you,
because these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial interest of the magnitude
required to trigger the change of control provisions or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control”
as defined in the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture expressly permits certain third parties to obtain control of
CGP without any obligation to make a change of control offer if such third parties are one or more “Permitted
Holders” or a “Successor Parent” as defined in the Indenture. For instance, if Rallye S.A., CGP’s controlling
shareholder on the Issue Date, were to have, directly or indirectly, a new controlling shareholder, such event would
not constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture as that new controlling shareholder would be considered
a “Permitted Holder”. By contrast, if secured creditors of Rallye S.A. were to take control of the portion of CGP
shares that Rallye S.A. has pledged to them, and such creditors are deemed to be a “group” for purposes of the
applicable U.S. securities laws, such enforcement may constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture if
they would hold more than 50% of the voting rights in CGP.

Furthermore, the definition of “Change of Control” under the Indenture will include a disposition to any person
of “all or substantially all” of the assets of CGP and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition
of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of CGP
and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control
has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors’ effective yield on the Notes may be diminished by the tax impact on that investor of its investment_**
**_in the Notes._**

Payments of interest on the Notes, or profits realized by holders of the Notes upon the sale, redemption or
repayment of the Notes, may be subject to taxation in the holder’s home jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions in
which it is required to pay taxes. Certain French and US tax matters relating to an investment in the Notes are
summarized under “Certain tax considerations”, however, that section does not contain a comprehensive
description of the tax impact of an investment in the Notes and the tax impact on any particular holder of the Notes
may differ from the impact described in that section. Prospective investors are urged to contact their tax advisors
for advice on the tax impact of an investment in the Notes.

**_Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the European financial transaction tax, if adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial
transaction tax (the “EU FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia,
Slovakia and Spain (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and
implemented by France, would replace the French financial transaction tax (the “French FTT”). Following the

84


-----

ECOFIN Council meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations
and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on an EU FTT.

The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some transactions
involving the Notes and to persons both established within and outside the Participating Member States. Generally,
it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution established in a
Participating Member State, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where
the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. On October 10,
2016, the European Commission was tasked with the drafting of the legislation that will be submitted to the
Participating Member States. However, and despite several attempts, no agreement has been found between the
Participating Member States so far. Recently, France and Germany expressed their wish to adopt an EU FTT that
would be inspired by the French FTT. The ECOFIN indicated on June 27, 2018 that Participating Member States
are currently considering such proposal. However, no final agreement has been reached yet.

The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such
tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU member
states may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the consequences
of an EU FTT associated with subscribing for, purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction and, unless
so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Notice to Investors”. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to
ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions”. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes,
and have no intention to do so.

**_The Notes are initially held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined in “Description of
_the Notes”), are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered_
owners or holders of such Notes. The nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be
the sole holder of the global notes representing the Notes. After payment by the Paying Agent to Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights of a
holder under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no assurance that procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a
timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a currency
other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative

85


-----

to the currency you use to measure your investment returns, caused by economic, political and other factors which
affect exchange rates and over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by
reference to which you measure your investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as
a result of any foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from your investment in the Notes. You should
consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption”, and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due_
to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

  - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after
completing this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and
may cease market-making at any time. Further, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed
by the Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, changes in the overall market for
high-yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may adversely
affect the liquidity of the trading market in these Notes and the market price quoted for these Notes. As a result,
we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop for these Notes.

Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in their prices. Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors,
including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
The market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Furthermore, CGP’s stock has been the
subject of speculative attacks, which has led to serious volatility in its trading price. Such speculation and volatility
may continue in the future. Any such activity may impact the market’s view of our outstanding capital markets
debt, including the Notes, which could have a negative impact on the liquidity in the market for the Notes or on
their rating. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes, regardless of our prospects
and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the
Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value,
if at all.

**_Issuances of Additional Notes may not be fungible with the Notes, which may adversely affect the value of the_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) as described under “Description of the Notes”. These
Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in
some cases may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional
Notes may be considered to have original issue discount (“OID”), which may adversely affect the market value
of the original Notes if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds to be received by us from the Offering will be approximately €800.0 million.

The Offering is expected to be consummated on the Issue Date, which may be prior to the date of the execution
of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the Offering is
consummated prior thereto, pending the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement providing for
the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion the Initial Purchasers (as defined
herein) will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of the
Offering into the Escrow Account. If the Offering is consummated concurrently with or after the execution of the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the foregoing escrow
procedures will not apply, and the Initial Purchasers will transfer the net proceeds of the Offering in accordance
with the instructions provided by the Issuer on the Issue Date.

We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, along with the proceeds raised in connection with the
incurrence of the New Term Loan B Facility for a principal amount of €1.0 billion and cash from our balance
sheet, to (i) repay amounts drawn under our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, (ii) repay and cancel our
Existing Bilateral Facilities, (iii) repay, through a tender offer launched on November 5, 2019, a portion of our
Existing EMTN Bonds at the CGP level, directly or indirectly through the refinancing of certain intercompany
loans (and deposit those amounts pending closing of the tender offer in a Segregated Account (as defined below)),
(iv) leave cash on balance in a Segregated Account to repay, on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date, along with
cash proceeds to the France Retail and E-commerce segments resulting from the Latam Reorganization
Transactions, approximately €195 million of the Segisor Credit Facility on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date
and (v) pay the fees and expenses related to the Refinancing.

The estimated sources and uses of funds related to the Refinancing are shown in the table below. Actual amounts
may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual date on which the Issue Date
and, if applicable, the Escrow Release Date occur and the commissions, fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Refinancing. The table below should be read in conjunction with “Capitalization”.

(2) In connection with the completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, our France Retail and E-commerce segments will receive
approximately €100 million of net cash proceeds, which will correspond to a cash outflow in an equal amount from our Latam Retail

(3) We intend to use the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay approximately €150 million of amounts that were drawn on June 30, 2019
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities. We also intend to use approximately €525 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to
repay seasonal working capital related drawings made under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities since June 30, 2019 and which will
be outstanding on the Issue Date (or, if applicable, the Escrow Release Date).

In connection with Refinancing, our Existing Bilateral Facilities will be repaid in full and simultaneously cancelled.

Our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities will not be cancelled in connection with the Refinancing. The lenders under our Existing

Facilities until their respective maturities. For a description of the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities”._

(4) We intend to use approximately €995 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay, through a tender offer launched on November
5, 2019, a portion of our 2020 EMTN Bonds, 2021 EMTN Bonds and 2022 EMTN Bonds. See “Capitalization”.

_Facility”._

(6) Represents our estimate of commissions, fees and expenses in connection with or otherwise related to the Refinancing, including the

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table presents the cash position and capitalization of (i) our France Retail and E-commerce
segments, (ii) our Latam Retail segment and (iii) the consolidated Group presented (A) on an historical actual
basis as of June 30, 2019 and (B) as adjusted for the Refinancing and certain other events, including the issuance
of the Notes offered hereby, and the application of the gross proceeds from the Refinancing in the manner
described under “Use of Proceeds”, as if such events had occurred on June 30, 2019.

The “as adjusted” figures do not represent the figures that we would have recorded had the Refinancing occurred
on a date other than that on which they were effectively realized, nor are they indicative of our future financial
condition.

Despite the fact that the Group has started to apply IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, the table below excludes the
impact of IFRS 16 in order ensure comparability with prior periods and ensure consistency with our past, current
and future public financial disclosure, as well as consistency with the covenants and related financial definitions
applicable to the terms and conditions of the Notes offered hereby. See “Description of the Notes”.

Our net debt position fluctuates quarter to quarter, mainly as a result of the regular seasonality of our working
capital requirements. See “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Factors affecting Comparability of Results” and “Summary—Recent Event—Current Trading”. In_
particular, the “as adjusted” debt figures in the table below do not reflect changes in drawings on committed
revolving lines (including the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities), commercial paper amounts, overdrafts and
finance leases since June 30, 2019. Similarly, the “as adjusted” cash figure in the table below does not take into
consideration the impact on cash of certain amounts raised in connection with such seasonal working capital
drawings since June 30, 2019 or changes in cash due to operating requirements.

In addition, the information presented below with respect to the Latam segment does not take into account the
impact of the Latam Reorganization Transactions (see “Summary—The Latam Reorganization Transactions” and
footnotes (13) and (14) of the table below), except for the net cash flow of approximately €100 million out of the
Latam Retail segment and into the France Retail and E-commerce segments (based on the intraday average midmarket EUR/COP and EUR/BRL exchange rates on October 28, 2019) as a result thereof.

You should read this table in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”, “Summary—The Latam Reorganization
_Transactions”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_
“Selected Historical Financial Data”, “Summary—Recent Developments—Current Trading” and the consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus.

(2) The “as adjusted” cash figures in the table above do not take into consideration the impact on cash of certain seasonal working capital
related drawings under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities since June 30, 2019.

(3) Adjustments of cash and cash equivalents reflect (i) a cash outflow of €675 million related to the repayment of Existing EMTN Bonds
that occurred in August 2019, (ii) a cash inflow to our France Retail and E-commerce segments of approximately €100 million
representing the proceeds to France Retail and E-commerce generated by the Latam Reorganization Transactions (which will correspond
to an equivalent outflow from the Latam Retail segment), which will be used by the Group, upon completion of the Latam Reorganization
Transactions, to repay, along with approximately €95 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing, approximately €195 million of the
Segisor Credit Facility on or about the Segisor Guarantee Date, (iii) a cash outflow of approximately €100 million in connection with
the partial repayment of the Segisor Credit Facility, (iv) a cash inflow related to the Refinancing of €525 million, which will be used on
the Issue Date, or if applicable, the Escrow Release Date to repay seasonal working capital related drawings under Existing Syndicated
Credit Facilities and (v) a cash outflow of €25 million resulting from the net use of proceeds. See “Use of Proceeds”.

(4) Represents principal amounts.

(5) We have from time to time issued unsecured bonds within our EMTN program. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Existing EMTN Bonds”._

(6) On August 6, 2019, we repaid in full our 2019 EMTN Bonds for an amount of €675 million.

(7) We intend to use approximately €995 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay, through a tender offer launched on November
5, 2019, a portion of our 2020 EMTN Bonds, 2021 EMTN Bonds and 2022 EMTN Bonds. Results of tender offers are uncertain in
nature.

(8) Represents the fair value of interest rate swaps and interest rate options entered into by the Group to hedge its interest exposure on the
Existing EMTN Bonds.

(9) We intend to use the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay approximately €150 million of amounts that were drawn on June 30, 2019
under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities. We also intend to use approximately €525 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to
repay seasonal working capital related drawings made under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities since June 30, 2019 and which will
be outstanding on the Issue Date or, if applicable, the Escrow Release Date.

In connection with the Refinancing, our Existing Bilateral Facilities will be repaid in full and simultaneously cancelled.

Our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities will not be cancelled in connection with the Refinancing. The lenders under our Existing
Syndicated Credit Facilities who have not consented to the Refinancing will stay committed under the Existing Syndicated Credit
Facilities until their respective maturities. For a description of the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, see “Description of Certain

within our Latam Retail accounting segment. As from the date of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, indebtedness related to the
Segisor Credit Facility will be accounted for within our France Retail segment. Segisor will be a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined below)
under the Indenture on the Issue Date and, therefore, the covenants under the Indenture will treat the indebtedness under the Segisor
Credit Facility as part of the indebtedness of CGP and its Restricted Subsidiaries from the Issue Date. Since June 30, 2019, approximately
€5 million of amounts due under the Segisor Credit Facility have been repaid. In addition, in connection with the completion of the
Latam Reorganization Transactions, approximately €195 million of the Segisor Credit Facility will be repaid with approximately €95
million of the proceeds of the Refinancing, along with approximately €100 million of proceeds to the France Retail and E-commerce
segments resulting from the Latam Reorganization Transactions. The remaining €204 million outstanding under the Segisor Credit

less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii) derivatives
with a positive fair value designated as fair value hedges, (iv) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and whose material assets as of the
Issue Date will consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of IGC and intragroup receivables owed to it
under the Proceeds Loans and, if applicable the Escrow Account. The Issuer does not prepare, and does not intend
to prepare, consolidated financial statements at the level of the Issuer. As a result, this Listing Prospectus instead
presents consolidated financial and other data for CGP and its consolidated subsidiaries only.

The selected financial information presented below is taken from CGP’s audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, prepared in accordance with IFRS and CGP’s unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019 prepared in
accordance with IAS 34, the IFRS standard adopted by the EU for interim financial information, a free translation
of which, in each case, are included elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus.

CGP’s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors for those years.
CGP’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2019
were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, CGP’s statutory auditors
for such period.

The selected financial information presented below also presents unaudited financial information of CGP for the
twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019 which was calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 –
Leases, to the audited consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 extracted from
the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, and subtracting the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2018, excluding
the impact of IFRS 16 – Leases, but restated to reflect the retroactive application of IAS 29 – Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies.

During the periods under review in this Listing Prospectus, we have adopted certain accounting standards that
may have an impact on the comparability of the financial information presented herein. This includes the adoption
of IFRS 16 – Leases, IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in HyperInflationary Economies and IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. We have applied each of these standards with limited
retroactive effect and as a result, our financial statements may not be directly comparable between periods. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information”.

In connection with our adoption of IFRS 15, we changed the presentation of the income statement appearing in
our consolidated financial statements beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018, with a restated presentation of the comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017. We did not, however, republish our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
December 31, 2017 (which include a presentation of comparative information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016). To facilitate the review of these periods and present our financial information in a
comparable manner:

  - where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the ended December 31, 2018, we present such income statement information
for the year ended December 31, 2017 restated for IFRS 15; and

  - where we present income statement information for the year ended December 31, 2017 alongside income
statement information for the year ended December 31, 2016, we present such income statement
information for the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding the retrospective application of IFRS 15
as it appears in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of
our financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019, we applied the full retrospective
transition approach and have restated all comparative information for the prior comparative period in accordance
with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. We have not, however, restated
our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 presented in this Listing
Prospectus to give effect to IFRS 16.

Our discussion of our results of operations from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018
and 2019 presented herein is on a pre-IFRS 16 basis. We also present certain non-IFRS measures on a pre-IFRS
16 basis in this Listing Prospectus. See “—Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial
_Measures”. While we will be required under IFRS to produce financial statements that give effect to IFRS 16,_

93


-----

compliance with our covenants under the Indenture, the New Term Loan B Facility and the New Revolving Credit
Facility will be calculated without taking into account the impact of IFRS 16 and we only intend to comment on
our financial condition and results of operations on a pre-IFRS 16 basis going forward in reports that we provide
to noteholders.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in_
_accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). This_
_discussion includes forward-looking statements that, although based on assumptions we consider reasonable, are_
_subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from those_
_expressed or implied herein. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks,_
_uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements._

**Overview**

We are a leading major multi-format, multi-banner and multi-channel retailer with over 120 years of history,
offering a diverse range of products and services to customers primarily located in France and, through our
interests in Grupo Éxito and GPA, in Latin America. We offer both brand-name and private label food and
consumer products through traditional retail stores as well as e-commerce websites and apps. We also provide
business-to-business and business-to-consumer services through our portfolio of complementary lines of business.

Our retail banners operate under formats which aim to adapt to current consumer trends and needs across the
various geographies in which we operate. Our premium retail format offers many innovative services and a highquality shopping experience. Our convenience retail format is adapted to both city centers and rural areas, offering
everyday basics to meet the expectations of customers searching for quality, authenticity and service. Our
hypermarket, cash & carry and discount retail formats offer a wide range of quality products at affordable prices.
We believe most of our banners enjoy leading market positions in most of our markets.

In addition to our retail operations, we have also developed a number of other complementary lines of business
that allow us to leverage our know-how while monetizing our asset base. These businesses include real estate
development and shopping center management, consumer finance, solar energy and energy efficiency solutions
via GreenYellow and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via 3W.relevanC and
ScaleMax, respectively.

We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although
through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other
international markets.

We operate our business in three reporting segments:

  - Our France Retail segment includes our French retail banners (including online sales associated with
such banners, but excluding Cdiscount), our ancillary business activities in France and our Indian Ocean
operations. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis, our France Retail
segment generated €18,796 million in net sales and €903 million in EBITDA.

  - Our E-commerce segment consists of our Cdiscount online retail business, which we hold through our
approximately 76% economic interest (as of June 30, 2019) in Cnova N.V. and which is fully
consolidated in our financial statements. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, on a pre-IFRS 16
basis, our E-commerce segment generated €1,979 million in net sales and €28 million in EBITDA, and
Cdiscount’s GMV amounted to €3,784 million.

  - Our Latam Retail segment includes our interests in the Latin American retail banners of GPA and Grupo
Éxito, in which we hold a 33% and a 55% economic interest (as of June 30, 2019), respectively, but
which are fully consolidated in our financial statements due to our ultimate voting rights in these entities.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis, our Latam Retail segment generated
€15,885 million in net sales and €815 million in EBITDA, excluding the impact of tax credits.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_General economic conditions in our geographic markets_**

The retail sector is particularly susceptible to swings in demand due to general economic conditions. Our results
of operations are therefore affected by specific economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, as well
as, to a lesser extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include levels of employment, inflation, growth
in gross domestic product, average and minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange rates,
the availability of consumer credit (especially for the purchase of non-food goods), consumer confidence and
consumer willingness to spend.

100


-----

We generate a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of food and other non-discretionary items, demand
for which is generally not as sensitive to macroeconomic conditions as demand for discretionary consumer goods.
Nevertheless, economic downturns may still have an adverse impact on the sale of such items as consumers may
reduce the overall amount they spend, by purchasing more entry-level products and/or shopping at stores operating
under lower-cost formats, such as cash & carry or hard discount stores. Even when consumers switch to our
banners operating under such formats, entry-level products and banners with a low-price positioning tend to be
structurally less profitable. As a result, our profitability may be adversely impacted if the mix of formats
generating our sales changes significantly as a result of economic conditions.

While our business and results of operations may be, and have in the past been, affected by adverse economic
conditions in the individual markets in which we operate, we have a diversified geographic footprint in France
and, through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, Latin America and believe that we generally benefit from
positive macroeconomic trends in the various countries in which we principally conduct business. For example,
the International Monetary Fund (the “IMF”) ranked France the seventh-largest economy in the world and the
third-largest economy in Europe in terms of gross domestic product (“GDP”), which amounted to €2,349 billion
in 2018. The French economy grew 1.5% in real terms in 2018 and is projected to grow 1.3% in 2019 and at a
compound average growth rate (“CAGR”) of 1.5% between 2018 and 2024, according to the IMF. France’s
economic growth is largely driven by three regions: Ile-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte
d’Azur, which, although accounting for 35.7% of the French population, generated 48% of France’s GDP,
according to the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). Approximately 63% of
our 2018 France retail net sales were generated in these three regions.

Moreover, GDP growth is expected to be positive in several of the principal Latin American countries in which
GPA and Grupo Éxito are present over the next several years. For example, the Brazilian economy, which was
the largest in South America in 2018, grew 1.1% in real terms in 2018 and is projected to grow 2.1% in real terms
in 2019 and at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2018 and 2024, according to the IMF. The Colombian economy, which
faced a growth slowdown in recent years, is expected to recover growing at an increased rate, with growth of 2.7%
in real terms in 2018, projected growth of 3.5% in real terms in 2019 and projected growth at a CAGR of 3.7%
between 2018 and 2024, according to the IMF.

For a further discussion of the macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which our businesses are present and
the trends affecting their growth, see “Industry”.

**_Competitive environment_**

Our results of operations are affected by the competitive pressures we face across our various business lines. We
operate in extremely competitive markets, and the retail sector as a whole has recently undergone significant
changes, primarily as a consequence of the increasing reach of the internet and the resulting changes in consumer
purchasing behavior.

Our brick-and-mortar retail business faces competition from international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers,
generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, specialists (including home delivery distributors) and
convenience stores. In addition, our pure e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, and, to a lesser extent, our brick-andmortar banners with e-commerce operations, also face intense competition, both from other e-commerce providers
and from brick-and-mortar retailers with e-commerce operations. Retailers are increasingly introducing internet
distribution platforms. Barriers to entry for e-commerce are low, and current and new competitors can launch new
e-commerce platforms at a relatively low cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any
of a number of successful e-commerce companies.

In certain instances, price competition can be curtailed by applicable regulation. For example, our French
hypermarkets are subject to the French law of October 30, 2018, which is also known as the Égalim Law (the
“Égalim Law”), which limits the ability of food retailers to sell certain categories of products to consumers at a
loss. The Égalim Law also limits food retailers’ ability to carry out promotional campaigns for food products for
a trial period of two years. For a more detailed description of the Égalim Law, see “Regulation—Restrictions on
_Promotions of Food Items”._

We believe we benefit from leading positions in many of our segments, which is reflected in strong market
positioning in the key markets in which we operate, as described by third-party sources. For a further discussion
of the market position of certain of our banners, see “Industry”.

We monitor the competitive environment of our markets and their trends at a country and banner level in the short
term, and react to such trends by adjusting our pricing and carrying out promotional or loyalty campaigns. In the
medium term, we also monitor our mix of formats and banners and seek out opportunities to increase multichannel sales. We also seek to identify and execute opportunities to grow our store network, develop new concepts

101


-----

and adapt our mix of formats to meet customer demand and respond to market trends. We accomplish these goals
through franchise transactions, strategic acquisitions and disposals, and identifying and developing store formats
and banners tailored to the different locations in which they operate.

For a further discussion of our competitive landscape, see “Industry”.

**_Seasonality and comparability of results_**

Our net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal variations due to consumers’ shopping habits and weather
conditions. As a result of these variations, comparisons of consecutive interim periods may not be a good
indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may bias year-on-year comparisons of
interim periods.

_Impact on net sales and trading profit_

Across all our businesses, seasonal fluctuations in our income statement have a relatively limited impact on net
sales, but a more significant impact on our trading profit, the majority of which is generated in the second half of
the year, which includes such peak holiday periods as the lead-up to Christmas. For example, net sales for the six
months ended June 30, 2018 represented 49% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 based on the
relevant average exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2018 (or 48% based on the relevant average
exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2018), while trading profit for the six months ended June 30,
2018, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, represented 37% of trading profit for the year ended December 31, 2018
based on the relevant average exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2018 (or 36% based on the relevant
average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2018).

_Impact on working capital and net debt_

Food and non-food retail activity tend to significantly increase in the period leading to the holidays at the end of
the year, reaching a peak in December. Ahead of such peak holiday periods, we will increase inventory to prepare
for anticipated demand. In particular, Cdiscount has generated an increasing amount of net sales in connection
with its annual Black Friday promotions in November (the precise date of which varies from year to year). Black
Friday has also had an increasingly positive effect on non-food sales during the fourth quarter in Brazil. These
seasonal influences have a direct impact on our earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory during or ahead of
these peak periods can affect our working capital requirements. In addition, any store closures during peak periods,
may in particular adversely affect our working capital requirements, and we may not always be able to avoid
having to carry out such closures, whether they be temporary or permanent, during peak periods.

These seasonal fluctuations have an even greater impact on the cash flows generated by the Group. Our liquidity
requirements fluctuate during the year and are normally at their highest in the first and third quarter of each year.
At the beginning of the financial year, our cash and cash equivalents generally decrease significantly, as we then
tend to make large payments to our suppliers for goods purchased to meet strong demand in the previous
December, leading to significant cash outflows. During the summer, the business registers a peak in sales due to
its strong exposure to touristic geographies. This trend reverses in September when the working capital is impacted
by both lower sales volumes and lower payables linked to the payments of the goods bought during the summer
peak.

_Calendar Effects_

We also experience calendar effects based on when certain holidays that are not celebrated on a fixed date fall in
any given year and on changes in the number of occurrences of certain selling days of the calendar week from one
period to the next. For example, we experience strong seasonality in our results for the months of March or April
as a result of the Easter holiday, which may fall in either our first or our second fiscal quarter of any given year.
In order to facilitate comparisons of our net sales, we present net sales in this Listing Prospectus as adjusted for
calendar effects, which includes the impact of the change in the number of selling days per calendar week from
one year to the next (that is, an increase or a decrease in the number of selling days in year N compared to year
N-1 over a given period) and the impact of calendar differences concerning selling days that traditionally see a
significant surge or drop in net sales (such as public holidays, school holidays, long weekends, major promotional
campaigns, seasonal sale periods and key holidays).

When presenting organic growth and same-store growth in net sales, we exclude the impact of calendar differences
from one period to the next (“Calendar Effects”). Such calendar differences are two-fold:

  - change in days of the week (“DOWs”), or the change in the number of selling days per calendar week
from one period to the next. For example, if in a particular month in period N-1, there were more

102


-----

Saturdays than in the same month in period N, sales in that month in period N would tend to be lower
(all other things being equal), because, for most formats in the retail industry, greater sales are generated
on a Saturday than other days of the week; and

  - change in special sales days (“SSDs”), or the impact of calendar differences with respect to days that
traditionally see a significant surge or drop in net sales. SSDs include public holidays (when stores are
closed and thus record no sales), holidays and long weekends (such as Easter or Christmas where sales
tend to be higher), major promotional campaigns (such as sales to mark a banner’s anniversary) and
unusual events that can affect seasonality (such as the soccer World Cup).

We calculate the calendar effect when analyzing changes in net sales from period to period, based on daily sales
for a particular month in period N, as the percentage change from such month in period N-1 to the same month in
period N of the impact of difference in DOWs and SSDs. For a given month in period N and the same month in
period N-1, the percentage change in net sales due to calendar effects is the sum of:

  - the impact of differences in DOWs, which we calculate as (a) (i) for any particular DOW that occurs
more frequently in a particular month in period N than it did in period N-1, the difference in the number
of occurrences multiplied by the forecast average sales generated on such DOW (excluding SSDs) in
period N minus (ii) for any particular DOW that occurred more frequently in a particular month in period
N-1 than it does in period N, the difference in the number of occurrences multiplied by the forecast
average sales generated (excluding SSDs) on such DOW in period N, divided by (b) total monthly sales
for the month in period N-1; and

  - the impact of SSDs, which we calculate as (a) (i) the sales forecast on SSDs in the month in period N in
excess of what typical days are expected to generate, minus (ii) the sales generated on SSDs in the same
month in period N-1 in excess of what typical days generated, divided by (b) total monthly sales for the
month in period N-1.

We calculate Calendar Effects for each period in advance and therefore such effects are calculated using the
forecast average sales generated on a particular DOW or SSD prepared by management, rather than historical
actual figures. Such forecasts are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties
subject to change, and they may differ from actual results for the relevant period. In addition, the preparation of
such forecasts requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts
presented in this Listing Prospectus that incorporate Calendar Effects.

_Weather_

Furthermore, adverse weather (such as heavy rains or snowfall) can deter customers from shopping in our stores,
and unforeseen weather conditions (for example unseasonably cold spells in summer) could render a portion of
our non-food inventory (for example fans and air-conditioning units) incompatible with such unseasonal
conditions.

**_Sensitivity of our cost structure_**

Excluding purchases of goods sold, we have a largely fixed cost base in the short to medium-term, which does
not fluctuate with sales volumes. Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period based on changes in
the size of our network of stores and the sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs
to a certain degree, such as those related to marketing and labor (via short-term and interim contracts), but must
maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the rise in our expenses in order to maintain or improve our margins.
However, certain expenses, such as rental and energy costs, are, for the most part, beyond our control. Moreover,
while we can adjust the size of our workforce, we are subject to laws setting minimum wages in each of the
countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions in our ability to reduce our workforce in France, which
further limits our operational flexibility. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—Increases

**_Changes in the size of our store network, the mix of our different formats and the roll-out of new store_**
**_concepts_**

One of the drivers of our results of operations is the size and evolution of our network of retail stores. We have
historically expanded our network through targeted acquisitions of existing banners and the opening of new stores
(both integrated stores owned by us and franchised stores) under banners we already own. We also regularly

103


-----

evaluate the performance of our stores and have sought to right-size our footprint through closures and disposals
of stores.

For example, since 2018, we have been implementing a plan (the “Rocade Plan”) pursuant to which we have
undertaken a thorough review of our structurally loss-making stores in France and have been disposing and/or
closing such stores. As of July 24, 2019, we had signed agreements for the disposal of integrated stores for an
aggregate sales price of €233 million under the Rocade Plan (net of transaction costs), of which €144 million were
completed as of such date. As of that same date, master franchisees of the Group, in which the Group holds a 49%
stake, had signed an agreement to sell 16 stores (consisting of nine Leader Price stores and seven Casino
supermarkets) to Lidl for a total of €17 million under the Rocade Plan (net of transaction costs), of which €16
million (net of transaction costs) was completed as of July 24, 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2019,
we incurred non-recurring costs of €50 million in connection with the disposals of our integrated stores.

Our results and our margins are also affected by the evolution of the mix between our integrated stores (those that
we own and operate) and stores owned by franchisees in our network, as net sales from our integrated stores add
leases and personnel costs to our cost structure. In addition, we generally incur initial and ongoing capital
expenditures and pre-opening costs with each new integrated store, whereas, pursuant to our franchise
arrangements, the cash impact on our Group for adding new franchised stores is more limited. As a result the net
sales and margin impact of each new franchised store, while lower in absolute terms, tends to be higher in
proportion to the investments required by us than the net sales and margin impact of each new integrated store.

We have two principal types of franchising arrangements:

  - joint ventures set up between us and a master franchisee that in turn owns one or more franchised stores
and pursuant to which we either fully consolidate (in the case of stores in which we own a controlling
stake) or recognize our share of net income of the results of such stores (in the case of stores in which
we do not own a controlling stake), which have historically represented the method by which Franprix
and Leader Price stores have been franchised; and

  - franchise contracts pursuant to which a franchisee pays a fee to license the rights to a banner and receives
a fixed allowance from us to set up the store. Such franchisees mostly purchase products through our
central purchasing agency and we recognize as net sales the amounts we receive from the franchised
stores which we do not consolidate for such wholesale transactions.

As of December 31, 2018, 5,593 of the stores in our network in France were franchises, of which 4,302 were
convenience stores and 113 were stores in the Indian Ocean.

As part of our business strategy, we have franchised out a number of underperforming stores to franchisees who
have experience operating stores in an attempt to improve their performance. In these cases, we have negotiated
a call option in order to be able to purchase the stores back after a pre-determined period of time and/or pursuant
to certain performance criteria. We also regularly pursue franchising opportunities as part of our overall assetlight financial strategy.

In addition, we are continually refining our stores’ offering and the overall customer experience within our various
stores through the development of new concepts. Stores that are converted to a new concept that has established
itself beyond a trial phase tend to outperform other stores under the same banner that have not yet been converted.

For a summary of the evolution in the size of our network of stores during the periods under review, see
“Business—Real Estate/Properties”.

**_Customer financing_**

We believe that, as a general matter, access to credit finance encourages sales, and as a result, the financing options
we are able to offer our customers have an impact on our sales and results of operations. Both Banque Casino in
France and GPA and Grupo Éxito in Latin America offer customers the ability to pay for their purchases in
installments through different finance options.

For example, through financial services that Banque Casino offers to consumers, such as its Coup de Pouce
consumer finance loans, Cdiscount customers may pay for purchases in four installments or qualify for longerterm loans. We believe this program is a key differentiating factor for Cdiscount. During the six months ended
June 30, 2019, more than 42% of Cdiscount’s sales and GMV were paid for through four installment payments,
with one upfront payment and three subsequent interest-bearing payments 30, 60 and 90 days after the initial
payment. Under the agreement implemented in August 2015 between Cdiscount and Banque Casino, Cdiscount
fully transfers the credit risk of the installments related to this program in France to Banque Casino. For the year

104


-----

ended December 31, 2018, the costs related to sales of receivables, including under this program, were €46 million
and were recognized as part of net finance costs for the Group and thus do not have an impact on EBITDA.

Installment sales are also a common feature in Brazil. GPA has been involved in extending credit to Brazilian
customers through a partnership with Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A., one of the largest privately owned financial
institutions in Brazil, called Financeira Itaú CBD S.A. Crédito, Financiamento e Investimento (“FIC”). FIC
exclusively offers credit cards, financial services and insurance coverage at GPA’s Brazilian stores. Part of GPA’s
strategy in Brazil is to increase the share of FIC’s credit cards and financial services at its stores as an important
loyalty tool and mechanism to increase sales and profitability. FIC’s credit cards offer payment options for the
cardholders at GPA’s stores, aiming to provide them with benefits and convenience and thereby encourage them
to make purchases at such stores.

GPA’s Extra hypermarkets offer consumer financing incentives to its customers to purchase home appliances on
an installment basis through its FIC cobranded and private label credit cards, as well as third-party credit cards.
Sales on an installment basis to customers using such credit cards have accounted for an increasing amount of
GPA’s sales in Brazil over recent years.

In Colombia, Grupo Éxito is party to a partnership with Bancolombia to offer consumer finance and credit cards
through a joint venture called Tuya. Tuya cards are the second most widely held credit cards in Colombia, and
permit customers to benefit from discounts and withdraw cash advances at Éxito’s stores.

Limitations in the availability of consumer credit, high interest rates on such credit or our inability to provide
financial services to our customer base, including, in each case, as a result of decreased consumer access to credit
in an economic downturn, could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations.

**_Changes in exchange rates_**

As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to currency translation risks and currency transaction
risks. Currency translation risks arise because we report our financial results in euro, but a significant portion of
our net sales is recognized in other currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso, the Uruguayan
peso and the Argentine peso. Transaction risks arise whenever we enter into a purchase or sale transaction using
a currency other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Our Group is primarily exposed to
transaction risk as a result of purchases of goods in U.S. dollars. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates could
have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements and lead to financial losses. For a discussion of
our exchange rate risks, see “—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks—Currency Risk”.

We hedge currency transaction risk on highly probable budgeted future purchases (mainly goods purchases billed
in U.S. dollars) through forward contracts (or equivalent instruments) relating to the payment currency. In
addition, we fully hedge currency risks on debt issuances denominated in a currency other than that of the relevant
issuer, except where the debt represents a designated and documented hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation of such issuer. We use standard financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and currency forward
contracts to manage our exposure to currency risks. For a further discussion of our management of currency risk,
see note 11.5.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018
included in this Listing Prospectus.

During the periods under review we have been impacted by hyperinflation in the Argentine peso. Beginning with
our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have applied IAS 29 – Financial
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies with limited retrospective application to address this issue in our
financial statements. IAS 29 requires that the statements of financial position and income statements of
subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies should be (i) restated by applying a general price index so
that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period and (ii) converted into
euros at the period-end exchange-rate.

**_Compliance with laws and regulations_**

As a large retailer of food and non-food items, we are subject to a wide of range of laws and regulations in each
of the countries in which we operate, as well as the regulations of the EU, each of which can have a significant
impact on the manner in which we conduct our businesses. Such laws and regulations include food health and
safety regulations, the prices we can charge for the products we sell, product safety regulations and labor laws.
Changes in and compliance with such laws and regulations may also entail significant costs for our Group and
can have an impact on our results of operations. For a description of certain material regulations with which we
must comply, see “Regulation”.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Results**

**_Changes in Consolidation Scope_**

As a part of our regular review of our stores’ profitability and our strategy for developing our franchising model
and expanding into market segments and formats that benefit from positive market trends, we have carried out a
number of acquisitions and disposals of stores and businesses. As a result of these transactions, our results of
operations may not be directly comparable from one period to the next. In particular, disposals of stores will have
a negative impact on net sales and, other than in the case of loss-making stores, trading profit and EBITDA, and
the gain or loss realized on the sale will be recognized as, and therefore have a one-time impact on, other operating
income. Sale and leaseback transactions will also have a one-time impact on other operating income, and will,
during the life of the relevant leases, increase finance expense (on an as-reported basis) and sales, general and
administrative expenses (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) as a result of the rental payments due to the purchasers of the
properties.

A description of the acquisitions and disposals that we have carried out since January 1, 2016 is below:

_Six months ended June 30, 2019_

  - Disposal of Via Varejo: On November 23, 2016, we announced that we had approved GPA’s decision to
start negotiations for the sale of its investment in its subsidiary Via Varejo, the largest non-food retailer
in Brazil, in line with its long-term strategic refocusing on the food retailing business. This sale was
completed on June 14, 2019 through a block sale on the market of shares in Via Varejo at a price of BRL
4.90 per share, representing a total sale price of BRL 2.3 billion (€517 million). In accordance with IFRS
5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, beginning with our financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 and through the date on which the sale was
completed, we accounted for Via Varejo’s results of operations in our financial statements as a
discontinued operation and our assets related to Via Varejo as assets held for sale.

Taking into account the two total return swaps (“TRSs”) entered into during the first half of 2019 with
respect to certain of GPA’s shares in Via Varejo, total proceeds received from the sale of the stake in Via
Varejo amounted to BRL 2.7 billion (€615 million). These transactions led to the recognition of a capital
gain after tax of BRL 55 million (€12 million), which we accounted for as net profit from discontinued
operations. The sale decreased non-controlling interests by €750 million.

Excluding the gain on the sale of Via Varejo, net profit from discontinued operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2019, mainly corresponding to the Via Varejo business between January 1, 2019 and the
disposal date, amounted to €1 million.

  - Sale and leaseback transactions:

`o` On March 11, 2019, we sold 13 Géant Casino, 3 Hyper Casino and 10 Casino Supermarkets
store properties to funds managed by Fortress for a sale price of €392 million, plus a variable
component whereby the Casino Group could receive up to an additional €150 million depending
mainly on the future yield derived from the monetization of the properties held by the funds;
this variable component has not been recognized in our financial statements. We have retained
a stake in the entity holding the sold properties. We will continue to operate the stores under
leases representing annual rent of €32 million. The sale and leaseback transaction generated a
capital gain before tax of €15 million recognized in “Other operating income”, taking into
account the impact of IFRS 16.

`o` We have also signed an agreement with funds managed by companies affiliated with Apollo
Global Management for the sale and leaseback of 31 store properties (12 Géant Casino and 19
Monoprix and Casino Supermarkets stores) worth €465 million (net of taxes payable). The
transaction closed on October 16, 2019. The sale price for this transaction was €341 million (of
which €327 million has been received and another €14 million is expected to be received within
twelve months following the transfer of another asset, which was postponed for technical
reasons; another asset had been initially identified for sale as part of this transaction and instead
will be sold to another third party by the end of 2019 under the same conditions). We may
receive up to an additional €140 million in the future from the sale, depending mainly on the
future yield derived from the monetization of the properties sold. This variable component has
not been recognized in our financial statements. We have retained a stake in the entity holding
the sold properties. The properties identified for sale as a part of this transaction were recorded

106


-----

as of June 30, 2019 as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 for a value of €338 million.
We expect to continue operating the stores under leases representing annual rent of €27 million.

  - Store purchases during the period: During the six months ended June 30, 2019, Franprix-Leader Price
acquired control of 36 stores from two master franchisees, for a non-material acquisition price. If the
acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2019, the additional impact on our consolidated net sales,
trading profit and net profit would not have been material.

  - Store disposals during the period: On May 29, 2019, as part of the Rocade Plan, we completed the sale
of three hypermarkets to Leclerc members for a total consideration of €38 million. On June 27, 2019, we
completed the sale of three hypermarkets, 11 Casino supermarkets and 16 Leader Price stores in France,
for total consideration of €58 million, also as part of the Rocade Plan.

_Year ended December 31, 2018_

  - Sale of a stake in Mercialys: On July 26, 2018, in connection with our Asset Disposal Plan, we reduced
our stake in Mercialys from 40.3% of the voting and economic rights to 25.3%, through a block sale of
shares representing 15% of the share capital of Mercialys to a bank under a TRS. We received immediate
proceeds from the sale amounting to €213 million.

Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank.
Consequently the shares were not derecognized from our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and a
liability was recorded for €198 million, corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the
market. The income statement impact of the bank’s sale during 2018 of 1% of the share capital was not
material.

As of December 31, 2018, the consolidated financial statements included the Group’s 39.2% equity in
Mercialys, of which 14% corresponds to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank. The
shares under the TRS were reclassified as assets held for sale, in accordance with IFRS 5, in an amount
of €114 million (representing the book value of the shares held under the TRS).

As of June 30, 2019, 50.4% of the shares held under the TRS had been sold. A corresponding capital loss
of €13 million was recorded under other operating expenses for the six-month period ended June 30,
2019, and the liability corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market amounted to
€125 million as of June 30, 2019.

As of June 30, 2019, the consolidated financial statements included the Group’s 32.7% interest in
Mercialys on an equity-accounted basis, of which 7.5 percentage points corresponded to the shares not
sold on the market at that date by the bank.

The remaining portion of the shares unsold under the TRS as of June 30, 2019 continued to be classified
as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, recognized at their carrying amount for €59 million.

  - Acquisition of Sarenza: On April 30, 2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, a leading online personal goods
and fashion retailer. The price paid for 100% of the shares was €22 million. Sarenza’s contribution to
consolidated net sales for the period from April 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was €97 million.
Sarenza’s net sales from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018 were €43 million. Sarenza’s contribution to
our pre-tax profit for the period was not material.

Sarenza has been consolidated at net book value, leading to the recognition of goodwill of €16 million
(corresponding to the difference between the book value of the acquired net assets and the consideration
transferred) as of June 30, 2019.

  - Sale and leaseback transactions: On December 20, 2018, the Group sold buildings pertaining to 53
Monoprix stores to Generali Group and 14 Monoprix stores to AG2R La Mondiale. After deducting
registration fees, the proceeds from this transaction amounted to €742 million (before transaction costs)
and generated a capital gain of €166 million, net of transaction costs. The Group will continue to operate
the stores under leases representing an annual rent of €35 million.

  - Store disposals during the period:

`o` On February 28, 2018, Franprix-Leader Price sold control of 105 Franprix and Leader Price
stores to a master franchisee. The sale proceeds amounted to €33 million. If the transactions had
been completed on January 1, 2018, the additional impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales,
trading profit and net profit would not have been material. Franprix-Leader Price retained a 49%
interest in the group of stores and has a call option to repurchase the group, which is exercisable

107


-----

between 2021 and 2023. The same master franchisee acquired a 40% stake in another group of
Franprix-Leader Price stores. The master franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake and
Franprix-Leader Price has a call option on such stake.

`o` During the first half of 2018, Distribution Casino France (“DCF”) sold a 40% stake in five
Casino supermarkets to a master franchisee, retaining control of the supermarkets. The master
franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake and Distribution Casino France has a call option.

  - Store acquisitions during the period: Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of 126 stores during 2018,
at a total cost of €79 million. Certain of the stores acquired were previously accounted for by the equity
method in our consolidated financial statements. The previously-held interest was therefore remeasured
at its acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €22 million gain in “Other operating
income”. If the acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2018, the additional impact on the Group’s
consolidated net sales, trading profit and net profit would not have been material.

_Year ended December 31, 2017_

  - Store disposals during the period: In February 2017, in line with our ongoing franchising development
plans, DCF sold to a master franchisee a 51% stake in two sub-groups representing a total of 21 Casino
integrated supermarkets that were loss-making. Our net loss on the sale amounted to €30 million and was
recorded in “Other operating expenses”. DCF has two call options on the 51% stake sold in these two
groups of stores, which are exercisable between November 2018 and October 2020.

  - Store acquisitions during the period:

`o` In the first quarter of 2017, Franprix-Leader Price acquired the remaining 40% interest in Sarjel,
a holding company for a Franprix franchise, that was not previously owned by the Group, such
that the Group is now the sole owner of Sarjel. The amount disbursed for this acquisition was
€19 million including transaction costs.

`o` In addition, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of various stores during 2017, at a total cost
of €43 million (of which €23 million was disbursed during 2017 and the balance in 2018). We
recognized goodwill in respect of these transactions of €29 million as of December 31, 2018. In
light of our equity-accounted investments in some of the entities concerned, the previously-held
interests were remeasured at their acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €9
million gain in “Other operating income”. The contribution of these stores to consolidated net
sales was €2 million and their contribution to profit before tax for the year was negative €3
million, before taking into account the gain recognized on remeasurement of the previously held
interest. If the acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2017, the additional impact on the
Group’s consolidated net sales and net profit before tax would have been €17 million and €2
million, respectively, before taking into account the gain recognized on remeasurement of the
previously held interest.

_Year ended December 31, 2016_

  - Disposal of operations in Thailand: On March 21, 2016, we sold our stake in our subsidiary Big C
Supercenter PCL (“Big C”), a company listed in Thailand, to BJC, a TCC group subsidiary. The proceeds
from the sale amounted to €3,066 million, net of disposal costs, generating an after-tax gain of €2,314
million. As part of the transaction, Cnova sold its economic interests in Cdiscount Thailand to BJC for
€28 million, net of disposal costs (including repayment of a €6 million loan), generating an after-tax gain
of €27 million. Big C was classified as a discontinued operation in our financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2016.

  - Disposal of operations in Vietnam: On April 29, 2016, we announced that we had sold Big C Vietnam
to the Central group for an enterprise value of €1 billion. As the decision to dispose of operations in
Vietnam was made before the end of 2015, the assets and liabilities of our e-commerce and retail
businesses in Vietnam were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 and our Big C Vietnam
business was classified as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds
amounted to €875 million, net of disposal costs, generating an after-tax gain of €524 million.

  - Acquisition of Geimex: The Group acquired 100% control of Geimex, a company jointly held by us and
the Baud family that owned the rights to the Leader Price brand name outside of France, in October 2016.
The purchase price amounted to €45 million and the transaction costs came to €1 million. Because we
originally held a 50% stake in Geimex, it was accounted for in our financial statements by the equity

108


-----

method on a 50% basis until October 31, 2016. The change in accounting method from the equity method
at 50% to full consolidation resulted in the recognition of a €16 million gain from remeasurement of the
previously-held interest, which was recognized in other operating income in our results of operations.

Geimex’s contribution to consolidated net sales and consolidated net profit for the period from October
31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 amounted to €25 million and €1 million, respectively (excluding the gain
from remeasurement at fair value of the previously held interest). If control of Geimex had been acquired
on January 1, 2016, it would have added an incremental €148 million to our consolidated net sales and
€1 million to our consolidated net profit.

- Creation of Viva Malls real estate trust: On July 15, 2016, Grupo Éxito created Viva Malls, a Colombian
real estate trust, to hold all of its Viva brand shopping centers and malls. On December 22, 2016, Grupo
Éxito and Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia, a private equity fund managed by Fiduciara Bancolombia,
signed an agreement providing for the acquisition by Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia of a 49% stake in the
trust’s capital. Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia’s total capital commitment amounted to 773 billion
Colombian pesos (or €245 million), of which €124 million, excluding expenses, was paid as of December
31, 2016, €80 million was paid during the year ended December 31, 2017 and €77 million paid during
the year ended December 31, 2018. Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia’s stake in Viva Malls was valued
based on the total value attributed to the trust’s real estate assets of 1,600 billion Colombian pesos (€506
million). Following this transaction, Éxito owns 51% of Viva Malls.

The transaction was accounted for as a transaction between owners, leading to a €3 million reduction in
equity attributable to owners of CGP (including €6 million in costs) and a €115 million increase in noncontrolling interests (net of €5 million in costs) in 2016, and increases of €23 million and €58 million,
respectively, in 2017.

- Acquisition of Almacenes Éxito shares: Between March 1 and March 18, 2016, we acquired 2.4 million
shares in Almacenes Éxito for a total of U.S. $11 million (€10 million), increasing our stake in Almacenes
Éxito to 55.30% from 54.77% previously. These transactions had a €6 million positive impact on equity
attributable to owners of the parent and a €17 million negative impact on non-controlling interests.

- Acquisition of CBD shares: In June 2016, we acquired 970,000 preferred shares of CBD, representing
approximately 0.4% of CBD’s capital, for €11 million. These transactions had a €6 million positive
impact on equity attributable to owners of CGP and a €17 million negative impact on non-controlling
interests.

- Store disposals during the period:

`o` In addition, Franprix-Leader Price sold to two master franchisees a group of loss-making
Franprix and Leader Price stores. The Group sold a 51% interest in the stores, generating a €61
million net loss, which was recorded in other operating expenses in our results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2016. If the transactions had been completed on January 1, 2016,
(i) our consolidated net sales for the year would have been reduced by €33 million, (ii) our
consolidated trading profit would have been increased by €13 million, (iii) our consolidated
other operating expense would have been increased by €9 million (comprising impairment
losses of €4.5 million and a €4.5 million remeasurement of the retained interest) and (iv) our
Group’s share of profit of equity-accounted investees would have been reduced by €6 million.
Franprix-Leader Price has various call options on the stores.

`o` In line with our franchising development strategy, during the second half of 2016, DCF sold to
a master franchisee a 51% stake in a group of 12 loss-making Casino supermarkets. The net loss
on the sale amounted to €34 million and was recorded in other operating expenses in our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. If the transaction had been completed on
January 1, 2016, (i) our consolidated net sales for the year would have been reduced by €14
million, (ii) our consolidated trading profit would have been increased by €9 million, (iii) our
consolidated other operating expense would have been increased by €1 million and (iv) our
Group’s share of profit of equity-accounted investees would have been reduced by €3 million.
DCF has a call option on the group of stores that is exercisable in 2019.

`o` Further, master franchisees also acquired a 49% interest in a group of profit-making Franprix
and Leader Price stores. These disposals without loss of control had no material impact on equity
attributable to our Group.

- Store acquisitions during the period: Franprix-Leader Price acquired controlling interests in various
groups holding stores in 2016. The amounts disbursed for these acquisitions totaled €32 million and

109


-----

generated provisional goodwill of €35 million. As certain of these groups were previously equityaccounted in our consolidated financial statements, the remeasurement of the interests previously held
generated a €3 million gain. The sub-groups’ contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from
the acquisition date to December 31, 2016 amounted to €23 million and their contribution to pre-tax
profit for the same period was a negative €11 million. If the acquisitions had been completed on January
1, 2016, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been increased by an additional €16
million and pre-tax profit would have been reduced by €1 million.

_Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth_

To adjust for changes in consolidation scope and for changes in the number of stores in our network, we present
organic growth in net sales and trading profit and same-store growth in net sales in this Listing Prospectus.

Organic Growth

Organic growth in net sales corresponds to consolidated net sales at constant scope of consolidation and constant
foreign exchange rates, excluding Calendar Effects and excluding net sales from fuel, because fuel sales is an
ancillary activity for our stores that is subject to a high volatility in price and demand depending on crude oil
prices.

For each of a given period N and its prior-year comparative period N-1, the base figures for organic growth in net
sales are computed on a monthly basis as follows:

  - total net sales;

  - _minus net sales of fuel;_

  - _minus net sales generated by:_

`o` companies acquired and thus brought into our consolidation scope after the first day of period
N-1; and

`o` companies sold and thus that were removed from our consolidation scope before the last day of
period N.

The base figure for a given period N thus derived is divided by the base figure for its prior-year comparative
period N-1 thus derived to arrive at a percentage change, from which the percentage change due to Calendar
Effects is subtracted. The variation of organic net sales from one period to another is computed on a constant
exchange rate basis, applying the exchange rate applicable to period N-1 to period N.

Transactions that involve a significant part of our network and are communicated to the market are treated as a
change in consolidation scope and are therefore also adjusted for as a part of the calculation of organic growth
(for example, disposals of hypermarkets in connection with the Rocade Plan). Management determines which
such transactions are sufficiently significant to be included as an adjustment in the calculation of organic growth
and, in making such determination, it is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect
the amounts presented in this Listing Prospectus that incorporate Calendar Effects.

For organic growth figures presented by banner, no adjustments are made to account for stores that operated under
a particular banner in period N and under a different banner in its comparative period N-1.

Organic growth in trading profit is calculated on the same basis as described above, except that it does not exclude
Calendar Effects or fuel sales.

Same-Store Growth

We show growth in net sales on a same-store basis in order to measure a like-for-like evolution between a given
period N and its prior-year comparative period N-1, excluding non-recurring effects, foreign exchange effects and
Calendar Effects. It measures the performance of our commercial concepts, while excluding the impact of certain
external factors or significant changes affecting our operations.

For each month within the periods under review, same-store net sales are computed as follows:

  - organic net sales for the period (calculated as described above);

  - _minus net sales attributable to wholesale sales made to our franchisees by our central purchasing agency,_
which we consider as subject to volatility due to changes in franchisees’ purchase policies (including
decisions on whether to source products through us or directly from third-party suppliers and changes in
inventory levels);

110


-----

  - _minus net sales generated by:_

`o` stores which opened or were acquired and thus brought into our consolidation scope after the
first day of the month in period N-1 (but only to the extent net sales from such stores have not
already been excluded in the calculation of organic growth for the relevant month); and

`o` stores which were sold or closed and thus were removed from our consolidation scope before
the last day of the month in period N (but only to the extent net sales from such stores have not
already been excluded in the calculation of organic growth for the relevant month);

  - _minus net sales generated by stores whose operations were affected by non-recurring events with a_
significant impact on sales performance, including the effect of: renovation works in a store causing a
full or partial store closure, public works causing a significant disturbance in access to or visibility of the
store and damage resulting from acts of god or civil disorder.

Same-store net sales are computed at constant exchange rates (as described above) and, because they are calculated
from organic net sales for the period, they include the related adjustments for Calendar Effects and fuel sales.

**_Changes in Accounting Methods_**

The following is a discussion of certain changes in accounting methods that affect the comparability of our results
of operations during the periods under review. For a further discussion of changes in accounting methods that
have occurred, see note 1.3 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the
six months ended June 30, 2019 and our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
December 31, 2018 included in this Listing Prospectus.

_IFRS 16 – Leases_

IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published in January 2016 and which became mandatory for companies
reporting according to IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases,
and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right
to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are
recognized. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly
used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of the
expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs. IFRS
16 requires lessees to recognize assets corresponding to the right to use the underlying leased asset for the
estimated term of the lease, as well as liabilities corresponding to the discounted obligation to make lease
payments for substantially all leases. Operating lease expense in the consolidated income statement is replaced by
depreciation of the right-of-use asset, presented in cost of goods sold or selling expenses, and interest expense on
the financial liability, presented in other financial expenses.

The new lease accounting rules under IFRS 16 primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases. Our
principal leased assets include our stores and warehouses. Previously, the Group classified most of its leases as
operating leases and recognized rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. No asset or liability
was previously recognized except to reflect any timing difference between the rental payment period and the
period in which the related expense is recognized.

We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of
our financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019, we applied the full retrospective
transition approach and have restated all comparative information for the prior comparative period in accordance
with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. As a result of the application of
IFRS 16, we recognized right-of-use assets of €5.0 billion (including contracts that were classified as a finance
lease under IAS 17) and lease liabilities of €4.8 billion as of June 30, 2019, leading to a decrease in equity in the
amount of €0.4 billion. Furthermore, our EBITDA increased by €463 million, depreciation increased by €374
million, our trading profit increased by €90 million, our profit before taxes decreased by €117 million (including
negative effects of €76 million and €134 million from other operating income and expenses and interest expense
on lease liabilities, respectively) and our consolidated net profit from continuing operations decreased by €87
million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 due to the application of IFRS 16. With respect to the consolidated
statement of cash flows, operating cash flows increased as a result of the application of IFRS 16, and financing
cash flows decreased, as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities are now classified as cash flows
from financing activities.

For further detail on the impact of our application of IFRS 16 on our financial statements, including a
reconciliation from our reported results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to the restated figures
for such period including IFRS 16 adjustments and IAS 29 adjustments, see notes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 to our unaudited

interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 included in
this Listing Prospectus.

Our discussion of our results of operations from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2018
and 2019 presented herein is on a pre-IFRS 16 basis and instead applies IAS 17. In addition, the financial
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 has not been restated to account for
the impact of IFRS 16.

_IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers_

IFRS 15 defines the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces IAS 18 – Revenue, IAS 11 – Construction
Contracts and all related interpretations. The standard defines a single model for recognizing revenue, in five
steps. It introduces new concepts and principles regarding the recognition of revenue, in particular the
identification of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price for contracts with multiple
performance obligations.

We decided to apply IFRS 15 from January 1, 2018 under the full retrospective approach, by restating comparative
information. In view of the nature of our businesses, the application of the standard had no material impact on our
previously published revenue and trading profit. Our discussion of our results of operations and cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 2018 presents for the comparative period the restated amounts for the year ended
December 31, 2017. However, our discussion of our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 presents the amounts for the year ended
December 31, 2017 prior to the restatement.

Adoption of IFRS 15 mainly led to reclassifications between net sales, other revenue, cost of goods sold and
selling expenses. This mainly concerns certain services provided to suppliers, certain promotional offers granted
directly by suppliers to end-customers, agent/principal qualifications in certain contracts and the presentation of
rental revenue. Retrospective application of IFRS 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2017 led to a €332 million decrease in net sales and a €30 million decrease in
trading profit (including €19 million in our France Retail segment and €10 million in our E-commerce segment)
compared to the previously reported amounts.

For further detail on the impact of our application of IFRS 15 on our financial statements, see notes 1.3.1 and
1.3.3 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018
included in this Listing Prospectus.

_IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments_

IFRS 9 defines new principles covering the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the
recognition of impairment provisions for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting.

We have applied IFRS 9 as from January 1, 2018 by recording the cumulative impact in opening equity at the
transition date. Individually, the changes resulting from our application of IFRS 9 are immaterial. For further
detail on the impact of our application of IFRS 9 on our financial statements, see notes 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 to our
audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this
Listing Prospectus.

**Explanation of Key Line Items from the Income Statement**

The following is a summary description of certain line items from our income statement. For more information
see notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Listing Prospectus.

_Net sales include sales by our stores and sales to our franchisees through our central purchasing agency (to the_
extent such franchises are not already consolidated in our financial statements), service stations, e-commerce sites
and restaurants, franchise fees (which were included in “Other income” prior to our first application of IFRS 15),
revenues from business leases and financial services revenues.

_Other revenue (or Other income prior to our first application of IFRS 15) consists of revenue from our property_
development and property trading businesses, rental revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental
revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and revenues from our energy business. Prior to our first
application of IFRS 15, Other income also included franchise fees.

_Cost of goods sold comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees and any tax_
credits associated with purchases, changes in retail inventories and logistics costs. Since our application of IFRS
15, it also includes amortization of the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and costs to fulfill contracts,
property development and property trading business costs and changes in related inventories.

112


-----

_Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are comprised of two components:_

  - _Selling expenses consist of point-of-sale costs. Prior to our first application of IFRS 15, selling expenses_
also included property development and property trading business costs and changes in related
inventories.

  - _General and administrative expenses correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including_
the purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions.

Depreciation and amortization expense is included in SG&A to the extent that the relevant asset relates to SG&A
activities. We also recognize depreciation and amortization expense on our inventory in cost of goods sold.

_Trading profit is defined as operating profit before other operating income and other operating expenses. On a_
pre-IFRS 16 basis, trading profit includes lease expenses. On a post-IFRS 16 basis, trading profit includes only
variable lease expenses, leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and depreciation of the right-of-use
asset.

_Other operating income and other operating expenses include certain items which, by definition, are not included_
in an assessment of a business unit’s recurring operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of
non-current assets, impairment losses on non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope
of consolidation (for example, transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from
disposals of subsidiaries, remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests) and (ii) certain non-recurring
items that would distort analyses of the Group’s recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of
income and expense that are limited in number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include
restructuring costs (such as reorganization costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions
and expenses for litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments).

Although we recognize restructuring charges in each period due to the evolution of our store network, we consider
these costs to fall outside of our recurring operating performance due to their nature. In addition, certain nonrecurring items may be included in net sales or other revenues.

_Income from cash and cash equivalents_ includes income on cash and cash equivalents and gains or losses on
disposals of cash equivalents.

_Finance costs comprise interest expense on financial liabilities, gains and losses on interest rate hedges (including_
the ineffective portion) and related currency effects. Finance costs also include changes in the fair value of hedging
derivatives instruments.

_Other financial income and other financial expenses comprise financial income and expenses that are not included_
in net finance costs, including, among others, dividends received from non-consolidated companies, non-recourse
factoring and associated transaction costs, discounting adjustments (including to provisions for pensions and other
post-employment benefit obligations), gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value of equity
derivatives, impairment losses, realized gains and losses on financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents,
and, from January 1, 2019, the interest cost related to the lease liability generated by the application of the IFRS
16 standard. Exchange gains and losses are also recorded under this caption, apart from (i) exchange gains and
losses on cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities, which are presented under net finance costs, and (ii)
the effective portion of accounting hedges of operating transactions, which are included in trading profit.

_Income tax consists of current and deferred taxes calculated in accordance with the relevant tax laws in force in_
the jurisdictions in which we operate.

_Share of profit of equity-accounted investees includes the Group’s share of the result of companies accounted for_
by the equity method.

_Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to owners of the parent represents the Group’s economic_
interest in the total reported profit/(loss) from continuing operations. As we consolidate a number of activities that
are not wholly owned (e.g., we only had a 33.09% interest in GPA and a 55.3% interest in Grupo Éxito, in each
case as of December 31, 2018), there can be considerable differences between net profit/(loss) from continuing
operations and net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to owners of the parent, and, depending
on the relative performance of our different segments, these items can even be directionally opposite.

unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by €54 million, or 0.3%, from €17,787 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to
€17,841 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was due to growth in net sales in our Latam
Retail segment and E-commerce segment, partially offset by a decrease in our France Retail net sales resulting
from the implementation of the Rocade Plan.

On an organic basis, net sales would have grown by 3.5%, and on a same-store basis, net sales would have grown
by 2.6%.

France Retail

France Retail net sales decreased by €266 million, or 2.9%, from €9,310 million for the six months ended June
30, 2018 to €9,044 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the impact
of the implementation of the Rocade Plan.

On an organic basis, France Retail net sales decreased by 1.6%, and on a same-store basis, France Retail net sales
increased by 0.5%.

Sales performance by banner over the period was as follows:

114


-----

  - Monoprix net sales increased by €23 million, or 1.0%, from €2,239 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to €2,262 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. On an organic basis, Monoprix
net sales grew by 0.3%. On a same-store basis, Monoprix net sales grew by 0.2%. Monoprix’s growth
was driven by (i) stronger food sales, in particular organic food products, and (ii) the development of its
e-commerce channel, sales through which grew by 47.7% compared to the first half of 2018, largely due
to its successful partnership with Amazon Prime Now. On a net basis, Monoprix closed 24 stores during
the period.

  - Supermarket net sales decreased by €35 million, or 2.3%, from €1,459 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to €1,513 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to disposals and
closures as a part of the Rocade Plan, a negative Calendar Effect and lower fuel sales. On an organic
basis, supermarket net sales decreased by 0.5%, due to store closures as part of the Rocade Plan. On a
same-store basis, supermarket net sales increased by 0.6%. Supermarket net sales growth on a same-store
basis was due in part to (i) stronger sales of organic products, (ii) the increase in the number of stores
operating on a cashier-free autonomous basis during part of the week (which allows for longer opening
times and increased sales volumes) and (iii) the further development of our Casino Max e-commerce
mobile application.

  - Franprix net sales decreased by €37 million, or 4.5%, from €818 million for the six months ended June
30, 2018 to €781 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. On an organic basis, Franprix net sales
decreased 2.5%. On a same-store basis, Franprix net sales decreased by 0.1%. Franprix net sales were
primarily negatively impacted by changes in the number of stores. Nevertheless, same-store growth in
net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2019 improved as compared to the negative growth rate
during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Moreover, sales of organic products were up 16.7% and
catering revenue was up 10.7%. Franprix also considerably expanded its e-commerce channel during the
first half of 2019, with sales derived from e-commerce up 62.6% during the period. This was partially
due to the launch of the new “Bibi!” loyalty program, which features real-time personalized offers to
customers. In addition, sales benefited from the increased number of Franprix stores operating on a
cashier-free autonomous basis during part of the week; as of June 30, 2019, Franprix operated 43 stores
on such a basis.

  - Convenience net sales increased by €12 million, or 2.0%, from €622 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to €634 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. On an organic basis, convenience
net sales grew by 3.5%. On a same-store basis, convenience net sales grew by 3.1%. This growth was
mainly due to increased sales volumes, reflecting continued positive consumer trends for the format.

  - Leader Price net sales decreased by €166 million, or 13.2%, from €1,260 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 to €1,094 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in Leader
Price’s net sales was due to in large part to changes in the store base due to the Rocade Plan. During the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, the number of Leader Price stores decreased from 776 to 665. On
an organic basis, Leader Price sales decreased by 11.8%. On a same-store basis, Leader Price sales
decreased by 1.7%.

  - Géant Hypermarket net sales decreased by €36 million, or 1.7%, from €2,158 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 to €2,122 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to disposals
pursuant to the Rocade Plan. On an organic basis, Géant hypermarket net sales grew by 2.1%. On a samestore basis, Géant hypermarket sales grew by 1.0%. This growth was due primarily to non-food sales,
which returned to growth in the second quarter of 2019, led by the good performance of in-store
Cdiscount corners. New specialist “shops-in-shop” are being developed, along with the Casino Optique
service. Géant’s e-commerce channel also continued to grow, with sales up by 8.4% during the first half
of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018.

3W.relevanC reported net sales of €24 million during the first half of 2019 (including net sales generated from
business within the Group), representing an increase of 38% over the first half of 2018, which was largely
attributable to its digital advertising campaign activation business, which consists of executing digital advertising
strategies.

E-Commerce

E-commerce net sales increased by €13 million, or 1.5%, from €876 million for the six months ended June 30,
2018 to €889 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
sales volumes. As part of our strategy for Cdiscount, we have sought to increase the percentage of GMV derived
from marketplace sales, on which we earn a commission without incurring marginal costs of goods sold.

115


-----

Cdiscount’s GMV grew from €1,614 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to €1,752 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019, representing organic growth of 11.0%, including sales and services in corners (or
“shops-in-shops”). The increase in GMV was primarily due to the rapid expansion of the Cdiscount à Volonté
customer base, which has grown to approximately two million subscribers, and by robust growth in the number
of unique visitors to its site. According to a study by Médiamétrie, Cdiscount had on average 19.6 million unique
visitors per month during the second quarter of 2019, an increase from 18.9 million average unique visitors per
month during the second quarter of 2018.

Latam Retail

Latam Retail net sales increased by €307 million, or 4.0%, from €7,601 million for the six months ended June 30,
2018 to €7,908 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to strong growth
in GPA’s Assaí cash & carry banner. On an organic basis, Latam Retail net sales increased by 10.1%. On a samestore basis, Latam Retail net sales increased by 4.9%.

In Brazil, net sales by GPA increased by €353 million, or 6.4%, from €5,561 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018 to €5,914 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. On an organic basis, GPA net sales grew
by 12.0%. GPA net sales grew by 5.3% on a same-store basis. Net sales in Brazil have been trending upwards for
several quarters, despite the depressed consumer environment, primarily as a result of GPA’s fast growing Assaí
cash & carry banner, combined with the roll-out of new concepts and the development of GPA’s e-commerce
channel.

  - Within Multivarejo (hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience), comparability of results between the
first half of 2019 and the first half of 2018 was impacted by exceptionally high sales during the second
quarter of 2018 due in particular to the FIFA World Cup, which are partially excluded from the organic
and same-store growth figures presented above; comparisons of Pão de Açúcar’s food sales and Extra
hypermarkets’ non-food sales were particularly affected. Sales by Extra Supermarkets were boosted by
double-digit growth at stores converted to the new Compre Bem and Mercado Extra concepts, and the
Convenience format continued to perform well, enjoying strong momentum while also leveraging the
synergies with the Extra and Pão de Açúcar banners and reinforcing its private-label lines. Multivarejo
also continued to build its e-commerce channel, including through the development of its express
delivery and click & collect solutions, available in 94 Pão de Açúcar and Extra stores as of June 30, 2019.
In addition, the “My Discount” loyalty app had been downloaded more than 9.2 million times as of June
30, 2019.

  - Assaí (cash & carry) reported same-store growth of 9.4% and organic growth of 24.5%. The banner
accounted for 50% of GPA Food sales for the first time during the first half of 2019, reflecting the success
of the business model and expansion of the store base.

Grupo Éxito net sales decreased by €50 million, or 2.5%, from €2,038 million for the six months ended June 30,
2018 to €1,988 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Grupo Éxito net sales were particularly negatively
impacted by exchange rates. On an organic basis, Grupo Éxito net sales grew by 4.7% and on a same-store basis,
Grupo Éxito net sales grew by 3.9%. This was driven by strong performance by banners in most of Grupo Éxito’s
markets, in particular the Colombian banners Surtimayorista, Éxito, and Carulla, partially offset by comparatively
weaker performance from Surtimax and SuperInter in Colombia and the Disco and Devoto banners in Uruguay.

_Other revenue_

Other revenue increased by €89 million, or 37%, from €238 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to
€327 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues from
our property development and property trading activities in France, unrelated to our Asset Disposal Plan and the
Rocade Plan.

_Gross margin_

Gross margin, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, decreased by €78 million, or 1.7%, from €4,505 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2018 to €4,426 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. As a percentage of
total revenue, gross margin decreased by 1 percentage point from 25.0% in 2018 to 24.4% in 2019.

In our France Retail segment, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 1 percentage point, as a
result of the increase in other revenues. Our E-commerce segment’s gross margin as a percentage of total revenue
increased by 4 percentage points in the period due to the increasing share of its higher margin marketplace activity,
as well as a shift in business strategy from using customer rebates and similar promotional tools, which reduced
margins, to attract more customers to spending more on advertising and other marketing means. In our Latam

116


-----

Retail segment, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 2 percentage points. 1 percentage point
of this decrease was due to the non-recurring recognition of tax credits in the first half of 2018 in Brazil (BRL 369
million (€89 million) for Assaí and BRL 45 million (€11 million) for Multivarejo) that decreased cost of goods
sold during that period but had no impact in 2019. Other effects include Assaí’s increased share of activity in the
Latam Retail segment, due to its low-margin business model, and a reclassification of the accounting treatment of
direct production costs into margin in Colombia.

_SG&A_

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, SG&A increased by €13 million, or 0.3%, from €4,067 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2018 to €4,080 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

In our France Retail segment, SG&A increased by €32 million, or 1%, from €2,471 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 to €2,502 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, mainly driven by additional rents
paid as a result of the entry into sale and leaseback arrangements pursuant to our Asset Disposal Plan, partially
offset by cost savings initiatives. These initiatives included optimization of headquarters and store costs (savings
of €29 million), negotiation of better purchasing conditions for goods not for resale (savings of €16 million) and
the development of synergies resulting from pooling of logistics flows and inventories for our Casino, Franprix
and Leader Price banners (savings of €15 million). E-commerce SG&A increased by €29 million, or 29%, from
€100 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to €129 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, due
to the increase in GMV, an increase in marketing and advertising expense (in lieu of expenses in customer rebates
and similar promotional tools used in the past to attract customers), as well as perimeter effects (linked to the
acquisitions of 1001pneus, an online discount tire retailer, and Stootie, an online platform allowing customers to
be paired up with handymen and other service providers). In our Latam Retail segment, at actual exchange rates,
SG&A decreased by €11 million, or 1%, and at constant exchange rates, SG&A would have increased by €80
million, or 5%. Of such increase at constant exchange rates, the increase of SG&A at Assaí alone, which grew by
22%, in line with its increase in sales, represented 4 percentage points.

_Trading profit_

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, consolidated trading profit decreased by €90 million, or 20.7%, from €437
million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to €347 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as a result
of the factors discussed above and in the segment discussion below. On an organic basis, consolidated trading
profit decreased by 12.1%. Excluding the impact of Brazilian tax credits of €100 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018, trading profit increased by 2.9% on an as-reported basis and by 12.9% on an organic basis. Changes
in scope of consolidation had a €22 million negative impact on consolidated trading profit for the period, while
the effect of foreign exchange rates and hyperinflation in Latin America had a €13 million negative impact.

France Retail

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, France Retail’s trading profit increased by €15 million, or 11.3%, from €136
million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to €151 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 (excluding
the impact of IFRS 16). On an organic basis, France Retail trading profit increased by 22.3%. This included €121
million in trading profit for our retail business during the first half of 2019, as compared with €114 million in the
first half of 2018, an increase of 6.1% on an as-reported basis and an increase of 19.5% on an organic basis.
Property development trading profit, which is highly dependent on the number of ongoing projects at any given
time and is not related to our Asset Disposal Plan or the Rocade Plan, was €30 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2019 (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), compared with €21 million for the comparative period in 2018.

France Retail trading margin (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) as a percentage of net sales increased to 1.7% for
the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 1.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Our cost savings plan (a
positive impact of €60 million) and the improvement in the format mix driven by the Rocade Plan more than offset
the negative impacts related to increased rents due to sale and leaseback transactions (€29 million), the one-off
purchasing power bonus paid as a result of a French law in response to the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests
in 2018 (€10 million) and higher payroll and energy costs (€10 million).

E-Commerce

E-commerce trading loss (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) improved to a net loss of €18 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019 from a net loss of €23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This
improvement was mainly due to an increased share of Cdiscount marketplace sales, which represented 40.1% of
GMV during the second quarter of 2019, compared with 36.6% during the same period in 2018, and on which we
achieve higher margins. This was supported by significant growth in fulfillment logistics services offered by
Cdiscount to marketplace sellers and increased business-to-customer service revenues.

-----

Latam Retail

Latam Retail trading profit (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) totaled €214 million during the first half of 2019,
compared with €324 million in the corresponding period of 2018, principally as a result of the impact of tax credits
in 2018, as discussed further below. Excluding Brazilian tax credits of €100 million for the six months ended June
30, 2018, trading profit was up 2.1% on an organic basis, as a result of the combined effect of the increased trading
profit of Assaí due to its successful organic expansion and growth in profitability and the negative impact of
Multivarejo’s underperformance in the context of lower consumer spending and higher investments in
promotional campaigns.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating income and expenses (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) increased by €171 million from a net
expense of €137 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net expense of €308 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019.

In France, other operating income and expenses (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) represented a net expense of
€254 million, compared with a net expense of €75 million in the first half of 2018. The increase in other operating
expenses was mainly due to (i) asset impairment losses of €99 million relating to our Asset Disposal Plan, (ii)
restructuring costs (excluding the Rocade Plan) of €28 million and (iii) net costs of €67 million related to the
Rocade Plan, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales.

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, our E-commerce segment recognized a net expense of €4 million in the first
half of 2019, down from an expense of €11 million in the first half of 2018. Other operating expense in Ecommerce was attributable to a number of different factors that were individually immaterial.

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, our Latam Retail segment recognized a net expense of €49 million in the first
half of 2019, a slight decrease from €50 million in the first half of 2018. Other operating expense in Latam Retail
was attributable to a number of different factors that were individually immaterial.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) increased by €4 million from a net expense of €155 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net expense of €159 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
This increase resulted from a decrease in interest income on cash and cash equivalents of €12 million following
the repatriation of funds formerly held in BRL, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings
and on finance lease liabilities of €7 million resulting from a reduction of debt in Colombia.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) decreased by €87 million, or 93%, from
a net expense of €94 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net expense of €7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019. This change was due primarily to the net effect of remeasurements at fair value of
non-hedging derivative instruments (a TRS and a forward contract on CBD shares).

_Profit before tax_

Profit before tax (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) decreased by €179 million from a net profit of €52 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net loss of €127 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as a
result of the factors discussed above.

_Income tax expense_

Income tax expense (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) increased by €23 million from a net expense of €24 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net expense of €47 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Income tax expense was primarily driven by the change in profit before tax and the underlying applicable tax rate
(down from 34.43% in 2018 to 32.02% in 2019), and was also impacted by (i) the tax-exempt competitiveness
and employment tax credit (“CICE”) to which French companies were entitled until 2018, which was replaced as
from January 1, 2019 with a reduction in an employer’s payroll-based contribution that increased our tax base, as
well as (ii) non-deductible expenses (primarily impairment losses) recognized during the first half of 2019. The
French business tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, or CVAE) is recorded under income tax
expense and amounted to €24 million during the first half of 2019, a slight increase from €20 million for first half
of 2018.

_Share of profit of equity-accounted investees_

Share of profit of equity-accounted investees decreased from €11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018
to nil for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This decrease was linked to the performance of equity-accounted
investees in the Latam Retail segment, whose contribution declined by €8 million between the two periods.

_Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations_

Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, decreased by €213 million from a
net profit of €39 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a net loss of €174 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2019, for the reasons described above. Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to
the Group, decreased by €158 million from a net loss of €68 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 to a
net loss of €226 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as a result of a slightly lower gross margin and
higher other operating income and expenses during the first half of 2019.

_Net sales_

Net sales decreased by €886 million, or 2.4%, from €37,490 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
€36,604 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Latam
Retail net sales due to a negative foreign exchange effect, which was partially offset by increases in E-commerce
and France Retail net sales.

On an organic basis, consolidated net sales would have grown by 4.7%, and on a same-store basis, net sales would
have grown by 3.0%.

France Retail

France Retail net sales increased by €262 million, or 1.4%, from €18,799 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to €19,061 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, France Retail net sales
grew by 1.2%, and on a same-store basis, France Retail net sales grew by 1.3%. Growth in France Retail net sales
was driven by growth in most of our banners due to a wide range of operational improvements and growth in our
network, as described below.

Sales performance by format over the period was as follows:

  - Monoprix net sales grew by €153 million, or 3.5%, from €4,366 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to €4,519 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, Monoprix net
sales grew by 1.7% . On a same-store basis, Monoprix net sales grew by 1.1%. Monoprix growth was
driven by growth in food sales on a same-store basis, particularly those of organic products, and growth
in customer traffic on a same-store basis. Monoprix’s online sales continued to grow rapidly, supported
by the integration of its Sarenza acquisition and the ramp-up of Monoprix’s partnership with Amazon
Prime Now. Moreover, Monoprix pursued its ambitious expansion program in 2018, opening 37 stores
on a gross basis, including 24 Naturalia stores (of which 6 were franchisees); on a net basis, the Monoprix
network increased by 6 stores.

  - Supermarket net sales grew by €33 million, or 1.0%, from €3,192 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to €3,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, supermarket net
sales grew by 1.4%. On a same-store basis, net sales grew by 1.3%. This growth was driven by the
conversion of stores to a more upscale concept and strong growth in the sale of organic products, as well
as the growth of its e-commerce channel at our supermarkets.

  - Franprix net sales grew by €6 million, or 0.4%, from €1,598 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to €1,604 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, Franprix net sales
grew by 1.5%. On a same-store basis, Franprix net sales grew 1.2%. Franprix’s growth was due in part
to increased customer traffic (which was up 2.4% for the year), growth in the network and the deployment
of stores that operated on a cashier-free, autonomous basis for part of the week, allowing for longer
opening times and higher sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in average basket size.

  - Convenience net sales grew by €49 million, or 3.9%, from €1,263 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to €1,313 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, convenience net
sales grew by 4.1%. On a same-store basis, convenience net sales grew by 1.7%. driven by positive
market trends and the success of its loyalty programs, including the Casino Max app rolled out to all
integrated stores. The banner restructured its offering, focusing on fresh and organic products, qualitative
services (such as bulk groceries, juice machines, fresh-cut fruits and vegetables) were developed and a
new green grocery store format, “Un Tour au Jardin”, was opened on a trial basis in Lyon.

  - Leader Price net sales declined by €49 million, or 1.9%, from €2,536 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to €2,487 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to disposals
of stores in the network, store closures as a part of the Rocade Plan and negative Calendar Effects. On
an organic basis, Leader Price net sales declined by 0.5%, due primarily to store closures as part of our
Rocade Plan. On a same-store basis, Leader Price net sales grew by 1.8%. Same-store sales were boosted
by the continued conversion of stores to the new Next concept, with the 112 stores that were already
converted as of December 31, 2018 outperforming the other stores in the network. The banner also
continued to restructure its offering by expanding its organic and fresh product ranges, adding service
counters, revamping its product packaging and rolling out the Sooa beauty and wellness private label
brand.

Géant Hypermarkets net sales grew by €128 million, or 2.9%, from €4,409 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to €4,537 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, Géant
hypermarkets net sales grew by 2.2%. On a same-store basis, Géant hypermarket net sales grew by 1.9%.
This performance was driven by a 3.4% increase in food sales, led by sales of organic products (up
26.9%) and fresh products. The 49 hypermarkets featuring Cdiscount “shop-in-shops” outperformed the
other stores in the network. In addition, the banner grew its e-commerce sales by 16.5% over the year,
by leveraging the operational excellence of its drive-through service and the ramp-up of the Casino Max
app. Finally, Sunday opening hours and promotional events also contributed to the banner’s healthy sales
trend.

E-commerce

E-commerce net sales increased by €57 million from €1,908 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
€1,965 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily driven by an increase in GMV of €342
million, or 10.4%, from €3,304 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €3,646 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Growth in E-commerce GMV was driven primarily by the following factors:

  - ongoing expansion of the marketplace, which contributed 34.3% of GMV. The number of references
available on the marketplace rose 37% compared with 2017. Sales for which we provided fulfillment
services represented 21% of marketplace GMV, up 63% over the year;

  - a 23% increase in monetization revenues, driven by the advertising and financial services sectors, among
which the “Coup de Pouce” instant loan offer was up 67%. Four new commission-based B2B2C services
were successfully launched in 2018 (travel, energy, ticketing and leasing);

  - the strong performance delivered by Cdiscount shop-in-shops, located in 49 stores as of December 31,
2018; and

  - the success of sales events organized during the year, including Black Friday, French Days and events to
mark the banner’s anniversary.

The banner consolidated its status as the number two player in terms of monthly unique visitors via computer or
mobile phone, extending its lead over its closest competitor. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the number of monthly
unique visitors to sites consolidated under our E-commerce segment totaled 21 million, representing nearly onethird of the French population. The Cdiscount mobile app accounted for 63% of customer traffic in 2018.

Latam Retail

Latam Retail net sales decreased by €1,205 million, or 7.2%, from €16,782 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to €15,577 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as explained below.

On an organic basis, Latam Retail net sales increased by 8.9%, and on a same-store basis, Latam Retail net sales
increased by 4.5%.

GPA net sales declined by €917 million, or 7.4%, from €12,333 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
€11,416 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the growth of Assaí, partially offset by a
negative foreign exchange impact. On an organic basis, GPA net sales increased by 10.6%, and on a same-store
basis, GPA net sales increased by 5.0%.

  - Multivarejo (hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience) reported same-store growth of 3.6%. Samestore sales growth accelerated at Extra Supermarkets, lifted by conversions to the new Mercado Extra
and Compre Bem formats. Same-store sales by the Convenience network increased steadily over the
year, due to a new marketing plan (including a revamped assortment, exploitation of sales event synergies
with Extra and Pão de Açúcar and steps to strengthen the private label). Pão de Açúcar growth continued,
due in part to the conversions of stores to a new “Generation 7” format. The converted stores are growing
significantly faster than the rest of the store network. The banner also deployed a new wine store concept
“Pão de Açúcar Adega”, combining a specialized store, an e-commerce platform and a mobile app.
Multivarejo also focused on repositioning its private labels, which are increasingly in demand among
customers of its hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores, and deployed a total of 500 new
private-label products this year. Finally, the banner pursued the roll-out of its digital solutions based on
the “My Discount” app, which had been downloaded 7.5 million times as of December 31, 2018.

  - Assaí (cash & carry) reported organic growth of 24.2% (its sixth consecutive year of organic growth
above 20%) and same-store growth of 8.1% in 2018, due to the success of its format among customers
and the expansion of the Assaí network.

Grupo Éxito net sales decreased by €296 million, or 6.7%, from €4,449 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to €4,153 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to the impact of exchange rates. On
an organic basis, Grupo Éxito’s net sales grew by 4.2% in 2018. On a same-store basis, Grupo Éxito’s net sales
grew by 3.1% in 2018. Grupo Éxito’s growth was due in large part to continued roll-out of new formats and
concepts, together with the growth of complementary businesses and omni-channel sales. Grupo Éxito, through
its Surtimayorista banner, continued to develop the cash & carry format in Colombia. Nine Surtimayorista stores
opened during 2018 (on a net basis) as a result of the conversion of existing stores. These stores doubled their
sales following their conversion. Grupo Éxito also continued to enjoy growth from the deployment of new

121


-----

concepts under its Carulla banner and Éxito hypermarkets. Moreover, Grupo Éxito continued to develop its
complementary businesses, such as property development with the delivery of the Viva Envigado and Viva Tunja
projects in October 2018. The property network now totals approximately 735,000 square meters. Lastly, the
Group pursued its omni-channel strategy with sales growth in e-commerce in Colombia.

_Other revenue_

Other revenue decreased by €23 million, or 4%, from €555 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €532
million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons described below.

France Retail other revenue decreased by €16 million, or 4%, from €397 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to €381 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in property development
sales and in property trading activity in France (which is by its nature subject to volatility due to the number of
ongoing projects at any given point in time) and is unrelated to the Asset Disposal Plan and the Rocade Plan.
Latam Retail other revenue decreased by €7 million, or 4%, from €158 million for the year ended December 31,
2017 to €151 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to the negative impact of depreciation of
the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso in 2018, which was partially offset by the positive effect of the
development of real estate projects in Colombia.

_Gross margin_

Gross margin decreased by €185 million, from €9,490 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to
€9,305 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the reasons discussed below. As a percentage of total
revenue, gross margin remained flat at 24.9% in 2017 and 25.1% in 2018.

In France Retail, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 1 percentage point, due to
improvements in our mix of concepts, geographies and products.

Our E-commerce segment’s gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 2 percentage points in
2018, due to the increased share of Cdiscount’s GMV attributable to its marketplace, which is a higher margin
source of revenue for us.

In Latam Retail, gross margin rate decreased by 1 percentage point, mainly due to the lower impact of tax credits
on cost of goods sold in Brazil in 2018 compared with 2017. In addition, the growth of Assaí’s share of GPA’s
business negatively impacts gross margin, as its overall business model has lower margins.

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, GPA recognized certain tax credits in Brazil. Such tax
credits were first recognized in application of an October 2016 ruling by Brazil’s supreme federal court regarding
the assessment basis for certain taxes, which allowed GPA to apply for a refund from the Brazilian state
administrations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, BRL 723 million (€201 million) for such tax credits
were recognized by GPA during the year, which were reflected in our results of operations as a corresponding
reduction in cost of goods sold. During the year ended December 31, 2018, GPA recognized only BRL 481 million
(€111 million) of such tax credits, which were reflected in our results of operations as a corresponding reduction
in its cost of goods sold.

_SG&A_

SG&A decreased by €182 million, or 2%, from €8,277 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €8,095
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In France Retail, SG&A increased by €222 million, or 4.7%, from
€4,729 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €4,951 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
resulting from the impacts of perimeter effects in Monoprix (including the acquisition of Sarenza in the first half
of 2018 and impacts of the expansion of the network in 2017 and 2018), the development of GreenYellow and
other operational initiatives such as the extension of opening hours. E-commerce SG&A increased by €21 million,
or 11%, from €194 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €215 million for the year ended December
31, 2018, in line with its 10% increase in GMV. In Latam Retail, at actual exchange rates, SG&A decreased by
€387 million, or 11%, and at constant exchange rates they would have increased by €181 million, or 5%. Of such
increase at constant exchange rates, the increase of SG&A at Assaí, the SG&A of which grew by 23%, in line
with its 24% increase in sales, alone represented 4 percentage points, and Grupo Éxito’s Argentine business, the
SG&A of which increased by 29% due to inflation, represented 1 percentage point of this increase.

_Trading profit_

As a result of the foregoing, trading profit decreased by €4 million, or 0.3%, from €1,213 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to €1,209 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the factors
discussed in the segment discussion below. On an organic basis, trading profit increased by 9.8%. Excluding the

122


-----

impact of tax credits in Brazil of €201 million in 2017 and €111 million in 2018, trading profit increased by 8.5%
on an as-reported basis and 18.0% on an organic basis. As a percentage of net sales, trading profit increased from
3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

France Retail

Trading profit for our France Retail segment increased by €43 million, or 7.9%, from €536 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to €579 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to improved retail
trading profit and the development of additional businesses (including GreenYellow and 3W.relevanC, offset
partially by a decline in property development trading profit. As a percentage of France Retail net sales, France
Retail trading profit increased from 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

Trading profit for the retail business excluding property development trading amounted to €518 million, reflecting
organic growth at constant exchange rates of 15.7% that was attributable to an improved margin mix, the
optimization of the store base and our banners’ success in signing up new store operators and franchisees. Property
development trading profit was €61 million in 2018, compared with €87 million in 2017.

E-commerce

Trading loss for our E-commerce segment decreased by €23 million from a loss of €37 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to a loss of €14 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of E-commerce
net sales, E-commerce trading loss decreased from 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 0.7% for the
year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an increased marketplace share, higher
revenues from relatively higher margin monetization of its marketplace, data, traffic, customer and logistics assets
and an optimized pricing and shipping strategy.

Latam Retail

Trading profit for our Latam Retail segment decreased by €69 million, or 9.7%, from €713 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to €644 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On an organic basis, Latam
Retail trading profit increased by 7.1%. As a percentage of Latam Retail net sales, Latam Retail trading profit
decreased from 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Latam
Retail trading profit was primarily impacted by the recognition of tax credits in Brazil, as described in further
detail above. Excluding the impact of these tax credits, Latam Retail trading profit increased primarily due to the
continued strong performance of Assaí, the success of new formats in Brazil and Colombia and efforts to optimize
store costs and reduce expenses generally in Brazil.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by €105 million, or 21.9%, from a net expense of €480 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to a net expense of €375 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year
ended December 31, 2018, other operating income and expenses included a net expense of €263 million, which
was mainly due to restructuring costs incurred to complete major store transformation plans (such as the
conversion of Leader Price stores to the “Next” concept, the conversion of Franprix stores to the “Mandarine”
concept and development of proximity formats). Other operating expenses also included non-recurring expenses
related to closures of loss-making stores pursuant to the Rocade Plan. In 2017, net operating expense mainly
comprised costs related to (i) the reduction of Géant retail space, (ii) the roll-out of the Mandarine concept across
our Franprix stores, (iii) the overhaul of our catering business and (iv) the streamlining of our convenience stores
network.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs decreased by €40 million, or 10.9%, from a net expense of €367 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017 to a net expense of €327 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease resulted
from a decrease in interest expense on borrowings and on finance lease liabilities of €85 million mainly driven by
lower interest rates in Brazil and Colombia, partially offset by a decrease in interest income on cash and cash
equivalents of €44 million related to the repatriation into France of cash held in Brazilian reais.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses increased by €60 million, or 75.9% from a net expense of €78 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017 to a net expense of €138 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
change was due primarily to the net effect of remeasurements at fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments

123


-----

(including a TRS and a forward contract on CBD shares) and the impact of applying IAS 29 to our operations in
Argentina to account for hyperinflation.

_Profit before tax_

Profit before tax increased by €83 million, or 29%, from a net profit of €286 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to a net profit of €369 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the factors discussed
above.

_Income tax expense_

Income tax expense increased by €156 million from a net expense of €48 million for the year ended December
31, 2017 to a net expense of €204 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition to an increase in our
profit before tax, income tax expense in 2018 was impacted by (i) non-deductible non-recurring expenses recorded
in 2018 related to currency conversion differences previously accounted for in equity and subsequently recognized
in our income statement in 2018 in accordance with IAS 21, (ii) the effect of a €60 million benefit recorded in
2017 due to a reimbursement of a tax on dividends and (iii) a tax expense on Monoprix real estate assets sold in
2018, to which an effective tax rate of 34.43% applied, but for which we had recorded deferred tax liabilities
based on a projected 2022 tax rate of 25.83% based on the most recent tax legislation.

_Share of profit of equity-accounted investees_

Share of profit of equity-accounted investees increased from €13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017
to €17 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was related to an increase in the contribution
of equity-accounted investees in the Latam Retail segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Group’s share of
profit of equity-accounted Franprix-Leader Price investees.

_Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations_

Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations decreased by €69 million from a net profit of €251 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017 to a net profit of €182 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the
reasons described above. Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to the Group, decreased by
€153 million from a net profit of €108 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a net loss of €45 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, principally due to higher income tax of €156 million. In 2018, the nondeductibility of certain non-recurring expenses resulted in an increase of €62 million in tax charges, while in 2017,
we benefited from a one-off €60 million tax benefit related to a refund of dividend tax in France.

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by €1,792 million, or 5.0%, from €36,030 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€37,822 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was due to increases in our E-commerce
and Latam Retail net sales, slightly offset by a decrease in France Retail net sales, as described below. On an
organic basis, net sales would have grown by 3.2%.

France Retail

France Retail net sales decreased by €36 million, or 0.2%, from €18,939 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 to €18,903 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was mainly due to declines in net
sales from our supermarkets and convenience and other retail businesses, partially offset by growth in our
Monoprix, Franprix, Leader Price and hypermarket sales. On an organic basis, France Retail net sales grew by
0.1%, and on a same-store basis, France Retail net sales grew by 0.8%.

Sales performance by format over the period was as follows:

  - Monoprix net sales grew by €87 million, from €4,229 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€4,316 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, Monoprix net sales would
have grown by 2.8%. On a same-store basis, Monoprix net sales would have grown by 2%.

Monoprix’s growth was due in part to higher customer traffic, an expanded range of services, the
development of its omni-channel strategy, the expansion of its loyalty program and the expansion of its
network. Monoprix customer traffic was up 2.0% on a same-store basis. During 2017, the banner
developed new services such as deliveries on foot within the hour and extending its opening hours. In
addition, Monoprix’s omni-channel strategy gained ground late in the year, with a 21% increase in online
sales in the second half of 2017 as compared with the second half of 2016, the entry into several online
partnerships (including with Ocado, Epicery and Google Home) and innovation initiatives (such as
Monop’Easy, a scan-and-go application that allows customers to avoid having to wait to pay at the
checkout counter). Monoprix continued to successfully deploy its new loyalty program and 66% of its

125


-----

net sales were made with card-carrying customers. Furthermore, Monoprix increased the pace of its
expansion, including through accelerating the development of its organic store format Naturalia (60
Monoprix stores opened in 2017, including 24 Naturalia stores; on a net basis, the Monoprix network
grew by 44 stores) and recording a 5.7% rise in same-store traffic over the year.

  - Supermarket net sales decreased by €48 million, or 1.5%, from €3,301 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €3,253 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due mainly to store
disposals to franchisees. On an organic basis, supermarket net sales would have increased by 1.2%. On
a same-store basis, supermarket net sales would have increased by 1.5%.

The increase in our supermarkets’ net sales on a same-store basis was driven in part by increased sales
of fresh and organic products, the continued roll-out of our new upscale Bijou concept, the expansion of
its loyalty program, the development of our supermarket loyalty program and the expansion of our
supermarket network through franchises.

  - Franprix net sales increased by €10 million, or 1%, from €1,586 million for the year ended December
31, 2016 to €1,596 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, Franprix net sales
would have increased by 1.3%. On a same-store basis, Franprix net sales would have increased by 1.3%.
This growth was due to increased customer traffic on a same-store basis (up 3.1% year-on-year), the
continued roll-out of the banner’s Mandarine and Noé concepts (with almost 80% of the Franprix
network having been renovated under the Mandarine concept at year-end) and the growth in the network,
primarily in the Greater Paris area.

  - Convenience net sales decreased by €12 million, or 1%, from €1,277 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €1,265 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to a decrease
in the number of stores in our network. On an organic basis, convenience net sales would have decreased
by 0.4%. On a same-store basis, convenience net sales would have increased by 0.3% when compared
with 2016, due in part to the continued improvement of our store network and the development of our
franchisee network. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we rolled out the new Le
Petit Casino concept in 128 stores, and developed new services, including home delivery and new corners
within stores, such as La Poste, Relay and PMU.

  - Leader Price net sales grew by €10.2 million, or 0.4%, from €2,526 million for the year ended December
31, 2016 to €2,536 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, Leader Price net
sales would have decreased by 2.9%. On a same-store basis, Leader Price net sales would have increased
by 0.2%. This growth was due in part to the deployment of Leader Price’s Next concept, which focuses
on more quality-oriented stores that maintain a discount cost structure. The banner also continued its
operational improvement initiatives, including an improved checkout process.

  - Géant Hypermarket net sales increased by €17 million, or 0.4%, from €4,432 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €4,448 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, Géant
hypermarket net sales would have been stable. On a same-store basis, Géant hypermarket net sales would
have increased by 0.1%. Our hypermarkets boasted strong food sales, which were led by fresh market
areas and fresh and organic products, and the continued development of its omni-channel offering and
loyalty programs.

E-commerce

E-commerce net sales increased by €152 million, or 8%, from €1,843 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 to €1,995 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by an increase in GMV
of €397 million from €2,994 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €3,391 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, an increase of 9.6% on an organic basis.

Growth in GMV was driven by the following:

  - Strong sales growth, especially during the third quarter of 2017, as a result of Cdiscount’s strategic
realignment plan to extend its product assortment and make further delivery enhancements, as well as
particularly strong Black Friday sales in November 2017 resulting from increased promotion of Black
Friday in France.

  - We continued deploying our strategic plan for our E-commerce segment, including:

`o` Expansion of the product range: we added an additional 17 million references in 2017, bringing
total online listings to 37 million, a rise of 80% in the marketplace product offering and a three
126


-----

fold increase in references eligible for the “Cdiscount à volonté” (CDAV) loyalty program.
CDAV accounted for 31% of GMV sales in 2017, a 10 percentage point increase over 2016.

`o` Enhanced multi-channel strategy: As of December 31, 2017, five Cdiscount corners were open
in Géant hypermarkets, with immediate pick-up available for nearly 4,000 referenced items.
The banner also began rolling out a click & collect service in stores.

`o` Enhanced delivery services and innovation initiatives: As of December 31, 2017, same-day
delivery was available in the Greater Paris area, Lyon, Lille and Bordeaux.

`o` Development of new revenue streams, including “Coup de pouce”, Cdiscount Energie, Cinstallé
and a roll-out of a range of services associated with the “Fulfillment by Cdiscount” solution.

Traffic to sites consolidated under our E-commerce segment increased by 12% to 922 million visits in 2017, and
the number of customers was 6% higher year on year, at 8.6 million. In 2017, Cdiscount was France’s second
leading e-retailer, with 17 million unique visitors a month on average.

Latam Retail

Latam Retail net sales increased by €1,676 million, or 11%, from €15,247 million for the year ended December
31, 2016 to €16,923 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily due to strong growth in
the Assaí format in Brazil and increased sales from the roll-out of new concepts and formats in Colombia.

On an organic basis, Latam Retail net sales would have increased by 6.4%. On a same-store basis, Latam Retail
net sales would have increased by 3.1%.

GPA net sales grew by €1,630 million, or 15%, from €10,749 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€12,379 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, GPA net sales grew 8.7%. On a
same-store basis, net sales grew 4.7%. This was the result of the following:

  - On a same-store basis, sales for Multivarejo (hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience) grew by
0.7% in 2017, due in part to additional market share in the period and higher sales volumes. Extra
hypermarkets performed well in 2017, buoyed by non-food sales, which generated double-digit growth.
Volumes at Pão de Açúcar improved beginning in the third quarter of 2017, as a result of several
initiatives, including the introduction of the “My Discount” loyalty program, promotional campaigns and
more attractive pricing on certain popular items. Finally, 50 stores were renovated at the end of 2017 as
part of our continued efforts to renovate stores under this banner.

  - Assaí (cash & carry) sales rose 27.8% on an organic basis and 11.0% on a same-store basis, buoyed by
network expansion (new store openings and conversions and a move into two new states). The banner,
which accounted for 41% of GPA Food’s annual sales in 2017, delivered steady growth in volumes and
traffic and also won additional market share, in a market context defined by falling prices for certain food
categories (such as basic commodities, dairy and meat).

At the end of 2017, there were 126 stores operating under the cash & carry format, an increase from 107
stores as of December 31, 2016, including 15 conversions of Extra hypermarkets to the Assaí format.
Sales in converted stores were 2.5 times higher than sales in Extra hypermarkets.

Grupo Éxito net sales increased by €45 million, or 1.0%, from €4,499 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 to €4,544 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. On an organic basis, Grupo Éxito’s net sales grew
by 1.2% in 2017. On a same-store basis, Grupo Éxito’s net sales declined by 0.6% in 2018, due in part to higher
competitive pressure in the Colombian market led by hard discounters. Grupo Éxito’s growth was linked to
development of its cash & carry format and new concepts designed to take advantage of favorable consumer
trends. Grupo Éxito also continued to grow businesses that complement its retail operations, including the
development of real estate projects such as Viva Envigado, Colombia’s largest shopping mall, and Viva Tunja,
and the Puntos Colombia multi-banner nationwide loyalty program.

_Gross margin_

Gross margin increased by €461 million, from €8,666 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€9,127 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin remained flat at
24.1%. In France Retail, gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained stable. Our E-commerce segment’s
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased by 1 percentage point, reflecting the implementation costs of
customer offering and service enhancements in 2017. In Latam Retail, gross margin as a percentage of net sales
increased by 1 percentage point, mainly due to a higher amount of Brazilian tax credits, which reduced cost of
goods sold, recognized in Brazil (BRL 723 million in 2017 versus BRL 288 million in 2016). The impact of these

127


-----

tax credits was partially offset by Assaí’s increased share of activity in the Latam Retail segment, which reduces
gross margins due to its low-margin business model.

_Other income_

Other income decreased by €128 million, or 24%, from €542 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€414 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in property
development sales and in property trading activity (which is by its nature subject to volatility due to the number
of ongoing projects at any given point in time), unrelated to our Asset Disposal Plan.

_SG&A_

SG&A increased by €126 million, or 1.5%, from €8,174 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €8,300
million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In France Retail, SG&A decreased by €164 million, or 3%, from
€5,003 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to €4,839 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
of which 2 percentage points were driven by savings realized due to increased franchising of Franprix and Leader
Price stores. Our E-commerce segment’s SG&A increased by €9 million, or 5%, from €189 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €198 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in line with its 8% increase in
net sales. In Latam Retail, at actual exchange rates, SG&A increased by 11%. Latam Retail SG&A would have
increased by 6% at constant exchange rates. Of such constant exchange rate increase, the SG&A of Assaí, which
grew by 29%, in line with its 27% increase in net sales, represented 4 percentage points.

_Trading profit_

Trading profit increased by €208 million, or 20.1%, from €1,034 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
to €1,242 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly driven by a strong increase in our Latam Retail
segment trading profit and an increase in our France Retail segment trading profit, offset partially by a decrease
in our E-commerce segment trading profit, each as described below. On an organic basis, trading profit would
have increased by 13.4%.

France Retail

Trading profit for our France Retail segment increased by €48 million, or 9.5%, from €508 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €556 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to stronger
profitability of our Franprix and Monoprix banners, an improved contribution from Casino Supermarkets and
increased profitability at Géant, as well as an increased contribution from our property development business
(€92 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with €87 million in the year ended December 31,
2016). As a percentage of France Retail net sales, France Retail trading profit increased from 2.7% for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

E-commerce

Trading loss for our E-commerce segment increased by €16 million, from a loss of €11 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to a loss of €27 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of E-commerce
net sales, E-commerce trading loss increased from negative 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
negative 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the impact of investments
we made in our E-commerce business under the Cdiscount strategic plan, including expansion of its assortment
and subsequent warehousing capacity and a revamp of its website and mobile application.

Latam Retail

Trading profit for our Latam Retail segment increased by €175 million, or 32.7%, from €538 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €713 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to the recognition
of tax credits in 2017 and a favorable exchange rate development. At constant exchange rates, Latam Retail trading
profit would have increased by 26.3%. As a percentage of Latam Retail net sales, Latam Retail trading profit
increased from 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Trading profit for Latam Retail was positively impacted by the recognition of certain tax credits by GPA in Brazil,
which were reflected in our results of operations as a corresponding reduction in cost of goods sold. In the year
ended December 31, 2017, the recognition of such tax credits had an impact of BRL 723 million (€201 million),
compared with BRL 288 million (€75 million) in the year ended December 31, 2016. Certain other tax credits of
Sendas Distribution (a subsidiary of GPA) relating to the period prior to November 2016, in the amount of BRL
369 million (€102 million), had no impact on the consolidated income statement, because they are not expected
to be recovered, and were written down in full. Excluding the favorable impact from GPA’s tax credit recognition

128


-----

described above, GPA’s trading profit margin would have increased from 2.1% in the year ended December 31,
2017 to 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 at actual exchange rates.

Grupo Éxito saw a decline in profitability as its trading profit margin, as a percentage of net sales fell to 4.0%,
down 123 bps. At GPA, trading profit margin as a percentage of net sales climbed 148 bps to 4.3%.

_Other operating income and expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by €145 million, or 23.2%, from a net expense of €625 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to a net expense of €480 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease
was primarily due to the gradual completion of a number of retail concept transformation programs in France. In
2017, in France, other operating expenses mainly comprised costs related to (i) the reduction of Géant retail space,
(ii) the roll-out of the Mandarine concept across our Franprix stores, (iii) the overhaul of our catering business
and (iv) the streamlining of our Convenience stores network.

In 2016, net operating expense mainly comprised (i) the reorganization of the Franprix – Leader Price and Casino
supermarkets networks in France, (ii) restructuring costs, particularly in France (primarily social costs and costs
associated with store closures) and the implementation of new concepts, (iii) provisions for litigation and risks,
mainly related to tax risks for GPA’s Brazilian operations, and (iv) other expenses, mainly reflecting the impact
of a change in tax rules which exceptionally resulted in our recognition of tax on retail space payable in France
for both 2015 and 2016 during the 2016 financial year.

_Net finance costs_

Net finance costs increased by €43 million, or 13.4%, from a net expense of €324 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to a net expense of €367 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was
due to an increase in interest expense on borrowings and on finance lease liabilities of €15 million, combined with
a decrease in interest income on cash and cash equivalents of €29 million. Finance costs were higher in France
due to the full-year impact of an interest step-up on our bond debt following Casino’s rating downgrade to BB+
by Standard & Poor’s in March 2016, which was partially offset by lower finance costs in Latin America,
reflecting the decrease in interest rates in Brazil.

_Other financial income and expenses_

Other financial income and expenses deteriorated by €43 million from a net expense of €35 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to a net expense of €78 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This change
was due primarily to the net effect of remeasurements at fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments in 2016
in connection with TRSs and forward contracts on CBD shares and on TRSs on Big C Thailand shares (which
swaps were unwound in 2016) and in 2017 in connection with TRSs and forward contracts on CBD shares.

_Profit before tax_

Profit before tax increased by €266 million from a net profit of €50 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
to a net profit of €316 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the factors discussed above.

_Income tax expense_

Income tax expense increased by €22 million from a net expense of €34 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 to a net expense of €56 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to
an increase in our profit before tax, offset by a €60 million benefit recorded in relation to the reimbursement of a
tax on dividends and the favorable impact from the activation of deferred tax assets.

_Share of profit of equity-accounted investees_

Share of profit of equity-accounted investees decreased by €7 million, or 35%, from €20 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €13 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was related to a €6
million lower contribution from our stake in Mercialys.

_Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations_

Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations increased by €237 million from a net profit of €36 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016 to a net profit of €273 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, for the
reasons described above. Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to the Group, increased by €94
million from a net profit of €33 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to a net profit of €127 million for

the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting an improvement in trading profit, partially offset by higher finance
costs and expenses.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We use cash to pay for working capital requirements, taxes, interest and dividend payments, capital expenditures
and acquisitions and to service our indebtedness in accordance with repayment schedules.

Our sources of financing consist mainly of the following:

  - cash generated from our operating activities and asset disposals;

  - borrowings under our confirmed credit facilities, overdraft facilities and commercial paper program (as
of June 30, 2019, CGP had confirmed, undrawn lines of €2,719 million); and

  - net proceeds from our outstanding debt securities and any other debt securities that we may issue in the
future.

As of June 30, 2019, as adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing and without giving effect to IFRS 16, our France
Retail and E-commerce gross debt before the impact of IFRS 5 would have amounted to €6,182 million, our
France Retail and E-commerce gross debt after the impact of IFRS 5 would have amounted to €5,199 million and
our France Retail and E-commerce net debt would have amounted to €3,615 million.

**_France Retail Assets Classified under IFRS 5_**

We hold a number of assets on balance sheet that are treated in accordance with IFRS 5– Non-current assets held
for sale and discontinued operations because they represent assets are held for sale. IFRS 5 allows companies to
classify certain assets as held for sale, and therefore presented separately in the company’s statement of financial
position, among other consequences, when a disposal occurs or is planned, including distribution of non-current
assets to shareholders, and certain criteria defined in IFRS 5 are met. The held-for-sale criteria in IFRS 5 apply to
non-current assets (or disposal groups) whose value will be recovered principally through sale rather than through
continuing use. The criteria do not apply to non-current assets that are being scrapped, wound down or abandoned.
As of June 30, 2019, excluding the impact of IFRS 16, we had €983 million in assets classified under IFRS 5 on
our balance sheet in our France Retail segment. These were primarily related to the Asset Disposal Plan and the
Rocade Plan. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, assets on our balance sheet classified under IFRS 5
decreased by €559 million, due primarily to the completion of the sale of real estate assets to Fortress.

The table below shows the net assets held for sale attributable to direct owners of the selling subsidiary in the
France Retail segment as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis.

**_Cash Flow_**

The following is a discussion of our cash flow from operations, cash flow from investing activities and cash flow
from financing activities, in each case from continued operations, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and
2018 and the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

_Six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018_

Net cash from/(used in) operating activities

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations decreased to a net outflow of €426 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2019 from a net inflow of €101 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This
was mainly due to a higher increase in working capital as compared to the prior period, primarily attributable to
our France Retail segment. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, change in working capital in France was
positive €69 million, as opposed to negative €247 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019, due to the
impact of several non-recurring items. Working capital in the first half of the year is usually impacted by a
significant negative seasonality effect, which has led to a decrease in working capital over such period of €314
million on average since 2015. While change in working capital in the six months ended June 30, 2019 represented
a return to this trend, it was still improved from this average, primarily due to a successful reduction in inventories
during the period.

Net cash from/(used in) investing activities

Net cash from investing activities from continuing operations increased to a net inflow of €60 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019 from a net outflow of €381 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This
improvement was principally related to proceeds from our Asset Disposal Plan offsetting capital expenditures
during the period.

Net cash from/(used in) from financing activities

Net cash from financing activities from continuing operations decreased to a net outflow of €786 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2019 from a net inflow of €413 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This
change reflects lower debt issuances in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period of 2018.

_Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017_

Net cash from/(used in) operating activities

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations slightly increased to a net inflow of €1,141 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018 from a net inflow of €1,123 million for the year ended December 31, 2017
due primarily to a lower decrease in working capital partially offset by higher outflows associated with taxes.

Net cash from/(used in) investing activities

Net cash from investing activities from continuing operations increased to a net inflow of €89 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018 from a net outflow of €1,105 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This
mainly reflects proceeds from our Asset Disposal Plan.

Net cash from/(used in) financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations decreased to a net outflow of €588 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 from a net outflow of €2,022 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This mainly reflects a lower amount of debt repayments in 2018 and the positive impact of the GreenYellow
capital increase in the second half of 2018.

_Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016_

The following table presents a summary of our cash flow from continuing operations for the year December 31,
2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2016** **2017**

**_Pre-IFRS 16_** **_Pre-IFRS 16_**

_in millions of euros_

Net cash from/(used in) operating activities .............. 1,786 1,123

Net cash from/(used in) investing activities .............. (1,067) (1,105)

Net cash from/(used in) financing activities .............. (2,202) (2,022)

Net cash from/(used in) operating activities

Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations decreased to a net inflow of €1,123 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017 from a net inflow of €1,786 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Despite
an improvement in EBITDA, net cash from operating activities was negatively impacted in 2017 by a decrease in
working capital in the amount of €336 million, partly due to tax credits and insurance settlements receivables in
Brazil and payroll and other tax benefits in France, each of which are recognized in working capital. Change in
working capital for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to an inflow of €640 million.

Net cash from/(used in) investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased slightly to a net outflow of €1,105
million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from a net outflow of €1,067 million for the year ended December
31, 2016. Underlying factors were also stable during the periods in review.

Net cash from/(used in) financing activities

Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations decreased to a net outflow of €2,022 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017 from a net outflow of €2,202 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
This decrease in outflow was mainly due to lower dividend payments made by CGP, as well as the effect in 2016
of exceptional items such as the repayment of convertible bonds issued by Monoprix, partially offset by lower
interest paid due to the positive impact of unwinding and modifying interest rate swaps in France. We also
experienced an exceptional cash outflow in 2017 related to the public tender offer for Cnova N.V.’s shares, which
further partially offset the inflows mentioned above.

**_Free Cash Flow_**

We define free cash flow as EBITDA less change in working capital, income taxes and net capital expenditures.
Free cash flow is presented before the payment of dividends to shareholders and holders of CGP’s Existing Deeply
Subordinated Perpetual Notes and excluding financial expenses. We present free cash flow as additional
information because we believe it is helpful to investors in highlighting trends in our business. However, other
companies may present free cash flow differently than we do. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our
operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

(1) Difference is primarily related to our property development business, whose EBITDA included a €30 million non-cash effect during the
six months ended June 30, 2019. Because we consolidate Mercialys into our financial statements using the equity method, margin
generated on property development transactions we carry out with Mercialys is not recognized in EBITDA to the extent of our interest
in Mercialys, As a result, a decline in our stake in Mercialys increases the portion of the margin recognition of EBITDA that was
previously eliminated in consolidation.

(2) Although our Group headquarters is located in France, we allocate head office costs among our different operating segments in
accordance with IFRS 8.

(3) Corresponds to the cash impact of non-recurring items recognized in our income statement under other operating income and expense.

(4) Before dividends paid to owners of CGP and holders of Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes, and excluding financial expenses.

During the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash flow from operating activities was a net outflow of €153
million, whereas net cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was a net inflow
of €208 million. This change is primarily due a decrease in working capital, which generated an outflow of €247
million during the first half of 2019, whereas an increase in working capital generated an inflow of €69 million
during the first half of 2018.

Historically, due to the seasonality of our business, change in working capital is negative in the first half of the
year. Change in working capital during the first half of 2018 was impacted by several one-off elements, resulting
in an inflow. Over the last five years, change in working capital was on average an outflow of approximately €314
million. Change in working capital for the six months ended June 30, 2019 is therefore an improvement when
compared to our historical average.

Free cash flow before Asset Disposal Plan was a net outflow of €247 million during the six months ended June
30, 2019, compared to an inflow of €150 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. This reflects higher
net capital expenditures during the first half of 2019 than during the first half of 2018, resulting from lower
proceeds from asset disposals made in the ordinary course of business. Although gross capital expenditures in the
first half of 2019 were lower, partially due to the completion of major store transformation programs, we
maintained levels of investment in digital activities and Monoprix. Seasonality of capital expenditures may differ
from one year to the other. We have a target of €350 million of gross capital expenditures in France during the
year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to €556 million in 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash flow from operating activities was a net inflow of €386
million, a decrease from a net inflow of €438 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Despite a higher
EBITDA, net cash flow from operating activities in 2018 was impacted by higher income tax charges in 2018, as
well as a greater decrease in working capital than in 2017.

The €133 million decrease in working capital in 2018 includes the negative €220 million impact of the Gilets
Jaunes (Yellow Vests) social movement at the end of 2018, which negatively impacted our sales and led to
overstock in stores.

Free cash flow before Asset Disposal Plan was an inflow of €229 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
an increase from €54 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This improvement was driven by lower gross
capital expenditures and a higher level of disposals made in the normal course of business. Taking into account
the impact of the Asset Disposal Plan, which resulted in cash proceeds of €734 million, total free cash flow
amounted to €963 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**_Net debt_**

Net debt corresponds to loans and other borrowings including related derivatives with a negative fair value
designated as fair value hedges and reverse factored trade payables reclassified as financial liabilities, less (i) cash
and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii)
derivatives with a positive fair value designated as fair value hedges, (iv) financial assets arising from a significant
disposal of non-current assets and (v) net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the selling subsidiary.

(1) Impact of Rocade Plan only applicable to free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

During the six months ended June 30, 2019, France Retail net debt increased by €192 million, whereas it increased
by €304 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. The improvement during the first half of 2019 was
mainly driven by a reduction in financial investments, which were €106 million lower during the first half of 2019
than they were during the first half of 2018. Our France Retail segment cash and cash equivalents as of June 30,
2019 amounted to €1,665 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, France Retail net debt decreased by €1,006 million, whereas it
increased by €515 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. This difference is primarily due to improved
free cash flow generation in 2018, which was €909 million higher than in 2017 (including the impact of the Asset
Disposal Plan), the GreenYellow capital increase of €149 million in 2018 and the increase in assets held for sale
recognized in accordance with IFRS 5 (€249 million higher in 2018), as well as the positive cash flow impact
related to the Segisor transaction of €200 million.

-----

During the year ended December 31, 2016, France Retail net debt decreased by €2,881 million, whereas it
increased by €515 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2016, we received €3,962 million in
proceeds from our disposal of our operations in Southeast Asia, whereas we did not carry out any significant
disposals in 2017.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures primarily consist of the construction and remodeling of our stores, investments in
digitalization, investments in our infrastructure, including improvements to our information technology systems
and improvements to our distribution facilities. We expect our gross retail capital expenditure in France to be
below €350 million per year during the 2019 – 2021 period, in line with amortization.

The table below presents a breakdown in our capital expenditures related to our retail and property businesses for
the periods under review, excluding the impact of our Asset Disposal Plan and the Rocade Plan.

**_Non-Hedging Derivative Instruments_**

We have entered into certain non-hedging derivative instruments, in particular a TRS (the “GPA TRS”) and
forward contracts (the “GPA Forward Contract”, and, together with the GPA TRS, the “GPA Instruments”)
relating to CBD shares, which are cash-settled instruments. Under the applicable documentation, when the forward
contracts expire, the shares are sold on the market by the banking counterparties and we are required to pay the
difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid by the counterparties to purchase the shares at the
contracts’ inception (if such proceeds are lower), or receive such difference (if such proceeds are higher). We
report the fair value of the GPA Instruments, and gains or losses on the GPA Instruments are recognized in other
financial income and expenses. As of December 31, 2018 the GPA Instruments had an aggregate negative fair
value of €272 million, as compared with a negative fair value of €260 million as of December 31, 2017. For the
six months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a positive €36 million fair value adjustment to the GPA TRS and a
positive €20 million fair value adjustment to the GPA Forward Contract. The GPA TRS expires in June 2020 and
the GPA Forward Contract expires in February 2020. For more information on the GPA Instruments, please see

(1) Does not include €97 million in fair value of interest rate swaps and interest rate options entered into by the Group to hedge its interest
exposure on the Existing EMTN Bonds.

(2) On August 6, 2019, we repaid our 2019 EMTN Bonds in full for an amount of €675 million.

(3) We intend to use approximately €995 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing to repay, through a tender offer launched on November
5, 2019, a portion of our 2020 EMTN Bonds, 2021 EMTN Bonds and 2022 EMTN Bonds. Results of tender offers are uncertain in
nature. Amounts shown assume that holders of (i) approximately 50% in outstanding principal amount of our 2020 EMTN Bonds will
tender, (ii) approximately 50% in outstanding principal amount of our 2021 EMTN Bonds will tender and (iii) approximately 43% in
outstanding principal amount of our 2022 EMTN Bonds will tender.

(4) Includes €900 million in outstanding principal amount of our 2024 EMTN Bonds, €444 million in outstanding principal amount of our
2025 EMTN Bonds and €508 million in outstanding amount of our 2026 EMTN Bonds.

(5) Our Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities will not be cancelled in connection with the Refinancing. The lenders under our Existing
Syndicated Credit Facilities who have not consented to the Refinancing will stay committed under the Existing Syndicated Credit
Facilities until their respective maturities. The Casino 2014 Syndicated Credit Facility matures on February 28, 2021. The Monoprix
Existing Syndicated Credit Facility matures on July 9, 2021. The Casino 2017 Syndicated Credit Facility matures on July 26, 2022.

(6) As of June 30, 2019 and as of the date of this Listing Prospectus, indebtedness related to the Segisor Credit Facility is accounted for
within our Latam Retail accounting segment. As from the date of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, indebtedness related to the
Segisor Credit Facility will be accounted for within our France Retail segment. Segisor will be a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined below)
under the Indenture on the Issue Date and, therefore, the covenants under the Indenture will treat the indebtedness under the Segisor
Credit Facility as part of the indebtedness of CGP and its Restricted Subsidiaries from the Issue Date. In addition, in connection with the
completion of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, approximately €195 million of the Segisor Credit Facility will be repaid with
approximately €95 million of the proceeds of the Refinancing, along with approximately €100 million of proceeds to the France Retail
and E-commerce segments resulting from the Latam Reorganization Transactions. The remaining €204 million outstanding under the
Segisor Credit Facility will become part of the indebtedness of our France Retail segment.

(7) The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 31, 2022 (if by such date our 2023 EMTN Bonds are not repaid or refinanced
in full (or sums sufficient in an amount to repay the 2023 EMTN Bonds have not been placed in a Segregated Account)) or on October
31, 2023. We do not intend to draw on the New Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Refinancing.

**Off-Balance Sheet Commitments**

We are a party to various customary off-balance sheet arrangements, including put options on shares in noncontrolled companies, security granted in connection with borrowings by GPA, bank guarantees given by GPA in
connection with certain ongoing tax disputes, guarantees issued on behalf of certain of our joint ventures and
minimum future lease payments. As of December 31, 2018, we were party to put options on shares in noncontrolled companies of €15 million (a decrease of €1 million from €16 million as of December 31, 2017). These
put options were related to Monoprix and Franprix – Leader Price entities.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks**

We are exposed to various market risks as part of our business activities. Several of these risks are described in
detail elsewhere in this Listing Prospectus under the caption “Risk Factors”. The main risk areas that may have a
material influence on our business performance as well as our financial position and results of operations are set
out below.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of a company not having the necessary funds to settle its commitments when they fall
due.

Our liquidity policy is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquid assets to settle our
liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market conditions.

We aim to mitigate liquidity risk through:

  - diversifying financing sources;

139


-----

  - diversifying borrowing currencies;

  - maintaining at all times confirmed financing facilities that significantly exceed our liabilities;

  - limiting annual debt repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule; and

  - managing the average maturity of debt.

The liquidity analysis is performed both at the level of CGP (taking into account cash pool in place with its French
subsidiaries) and for each of our international subsidiaries. Each banner submits weekly cash reports to the Group
and all new financing facilities require prior approval from the Corporate Finance department. For a discussion of
our contractual commitments under our financial debt, see “—Contractual Obligations and Commitments”.

For a further discussion of our management of liquidity risk, see note 9.5 to our unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and note 11.5.4 to our audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Listing
Prospectus.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk related to an increase in borrowing costs due to higher interest rates. We are exposed
to this risk to the extent that our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates.

We manage interest rate risk by monitoring rate forecasts and, when necessary, entering into hedging transactions.
The aim is to manage the risk of an increase in interest rates and optimize borrowing costs. We use various
standard instruments to implement this strategy, principally interest rate swaps and options. These instruments do
not always qualify for hedge accounting; however, all interest rate instruments are contracted in line with our risk
management policy.

CGP’s debt is mainly composed of fixed-rate bonds. Certain interest streams on part of this debt were swapped
for variable rate streams. As of December 31, 2018, CGP had a portfolio of 68 interest rate swaps and options
with 12 bank counterparties. These instruments expire at various dates between 2019 and 2026. As a result, as of
December 31, 2018, 31% of the outstanding amount of CGP’s bond debt was hedged at a fixed rate, 35% was
hedged at capped variable rates and 34% was unhedged and accrued at uncapped variable rates.

For a further discussion of our management of interest rate risk, see note 11.5.2 to our audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Listing Prospectus.

**_Currency Risk_**

Due to our geographically diversified business base, we are exposed to both currency translation risk on the
translation of the balance sheets and income statements of subsidiaries outside the euro zone into euro and to
currency transaction risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro. Currency translation risk
primarily concerns the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries in Brazil and Colombia and arises from
changes in exchange rates for the Brazilian real and Colombian peso against the euro. Transaction risk mainly
concerns goods purchases billed in U.S. dollars.

An unfavorable change in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements
(translation risk) and lead to financial losses (transaction risk).

We hedge currency transaction risk on highly probable future purchases (mainly goods purchases billed in U.S.
dollars) through forward purchases of the payment currency. In addition, we fully hedge currency risks on debt
issuances denominated in a currency other than that of the issuer.

We use standard financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward currency transactions to manage
our exposure to currency risks. These instruments are mainly over-the-counter instruments entered into with firstclass bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or instruments qualify for hedge accounting. However, like
many other large groups, we may take very small, strictly controlled positions that do not qualify for hedge
accounting, for more dynamic and flexible management of our interest rate exposures.

For a further discussion of our management of currency risk, see note 11.5.2 to our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Listing Prospectus.

**_Counterparty and Credit Risk_**

Counterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty fails and is unable to honor its financial commitments (credit risk)
or other commitments to our group.

140


-----

We are exposed to counterparty risk in several ways: as a result of our operating activities (for example, consumer
finance for our customers), our cash investing activities and our interest rate and currency hedging activities (our
counterparties being banking institutions for the latter three cases). If a counterparty risk were to occur, we could
incur financial losses.

We monitor these risks regularly using several objective indicators and attempt to reduce our exposure by dealing
with low-risk counterparties (as determined mainly on such counterparties’ credit ratings and their reciprocal
commitments with us).

Our policy for managing customer credit risk consists of checking the financial health of all customers applying
for credit. We regularly monitor customer receivables. We do not believe our exposure to bad debts is material.

A breakdown of our trade receivables by maturity is below:

**As of December 31,**

**2017** **2018**

_in millions of euros_

Receivables not yet due, not impaired .......... 728 690

Past due receivables, not impaired ............... 139 184

_Of which_

_Up to one month past due ......................_ _69_ _89_

_Between one and six months past_

_due ......................................................_ _36_ _46_

_More than six months past due .............._ _34_ _49_

Impaired receivables ..................................... 153 156

**Total .............................................................** **1,020** **1,030**

As for credit risk on other financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, loans, legal deposits paid by GPA
and derivative financial instruments, our maximum exposure is limited to such instruments’ carrying amount. Our
cash management policy consists of investing cash and cash equivalents with highly-rated counterparties and in
high-quality money market instruments.

For a further discussion of our management of currency risk, see note 11.5.3 to our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in this Listing Prospectus.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

IFRS requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. These
estimates and assumptions are based on the information available at the time of preparation of the financial
statements and affect the published amounts. Future results may differ from these estimates.

For a detailed description of the accounting rules and methods that we apply under IFRS, see note 1 to our
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2019
and note 1 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018.

**France**

**_Macroeconomic and Demographic Overview_**

In 2018, the nominal gross domestic product (“GDP”) of France amounted to €2,349 billion, according to the
International Monetary Fund (“IMF”). The IMF ranked France as the 7[th] largest economy globally, and 3[rd] largest
in Europe. The French economy grew 1.5% in real terms in 2018, is projected to grow 1.3% in 2019 and 1.5%
with a compound average growth rate (“CAGR”) between 2018 and 2024 (source: IMF). Due to ECB policy,
inflation is relatively low in France, reaching 2.1% in 2018. Inflation is projected to be 1.3% in 2019, with a
CAGR of 1.8% between 2019-2024 (source: IMF).

France is one of the most populated countries in Europe, currently ranking only behind Russia, Germany and the
UK. In 2018, the population of France amounted to 64.7 million people (source: IMF) and was 1.1% higher than
in 2014. The French population is expected to reach 66.5 million people by 2024, which implies a 0.5% CAGR
between 2018 and 2024 (source: IMF).

80% of the French population lives in cities (source: World Bank), with around 20% of the total population living
in the Paris area as of January 1, 2019 _(source: Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques,_
_“INSEE”). France’s economic growth is largely driven by three regions: Ile-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and_
Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur. These regions each have favourable trends such as tourism, favourable
demographics and high living standards. These three regions have a cumulative population of 23.9 million people
(35.7% of the total French population), but generate 48% of France’s GDP according to latest data available for
2018 (source: INSEE). The French unemployment rate was 9.1% in 2018 and is projected to decrease to 8.8% in
2019 and even further to 8.4% in 2020 (source: IMF).

**_Grocery Retail – Key Trends_**

France remains a dynamic market for retail. In France, food expenses account for 12% of the aggregate consumer
spending. This is relatively high compared to other European countries (e.g. 11.3% for Spain, 9.4% for Germany,
7.1% for the UK and slightly below 13.1% for Italy. (source: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
_Development, “OECD”)._

**‘13-18**

**2013** **2014** **2015** **2016** **2017** **2018** **CAGR**

Food spending (€ million).. 140,281 140,140 141,841 144,659 146,402 147,967 1.1%

_Source: OECD_

As a comparison, in 2018, Italy’s food spending amounted to €138,759 million, €77,978 million for Spain,
€153,604 million for Germany and €94,403 million for the UK according to the same source.

Between 2013-18, grocery retail sales in France grew at a CAGR of 1.2%, according to Euromonitor. The French
retailing market is gradually evolving, driven by changing consumer lifestyles and socio-demographic trends,
such as an ageing population, smaller families, growing individualisation of lifestyles, digitalisation as well as
increasing urbanisation. These trends have led to a transition in gross retail from mass market to more tailored
offers which results in a greater diversity of retail formats and concepts, a broader and more segmented product
offering, as well as more individualised contact with consumers.

As economic prospects have deteriorated with falls in household consumption affected by rising taxes and a price
inflation that exceeds growth of wages and social security benefits, several challenges weigh on major store-based
grocery retailing players. Such challenges include technological change, with the emergence of international
marketplaces operating online and pure player specialists, as well as moderate volume growth due to slowdown
in economic activity. In addition, grocery retailing players are experiencing increasing competition from online
retailing as well as from international players interested in the French market, such as Action, Hema or Stokomani,
or growing local players such as Grand Frais, and the development of organic specialist retailers.

The grocery retail market is rapidly evolving on the technological front. Store-based grocery retailers are signing
new partnerships or acquiring digital players to adapt to consumer demand. With the spread of internet usage,
retailers are developing internet-linked solutions to meet consumer demand and pure-play online retailers acquire
physical spaces. The convergence of pure players and bricks-and-clicks retailers is expected to lead to the further
development of web-to-store concepts, notably “phygital” stores, hybrid connected bricks-and-clicks shops which
enable consumers to order on big screens (e.g. Monoprix’s acquisition of Sarenza or Carrefour’s acquisition of
17% of Showroomprivé).

To maintain or increase market shares, grocery retailers are expected to focus on their e-commerce operations, athome delivery services, omni-channel product offering, lengthening opening schedules as well as improvements
to product differentiation and price competition.

**_Grocery Retail – Overview of Key Formats from Euromonitor_**

_Modern grocery retailing is the aggregation of the grocery channels that have emerged alongside the growth of_
chained retail. It is the aggregation of five channels: Hypermarkets, Supermarkets, Discounters, Forecourt
Retailers and Convenience Stores.

_Traditional grocery retailing is the aggregation of channels that are invariably non-chained and are, therefore,_
owned by families and/or run on an individual basis. It is the aggregation of three channels: Independent Small
Grocers, Food/Drink/Tobacco Specialists and Other Grocery Retailers.

In 2018, 80.5% of French grocery retail sales were accounted for by modern grocery retailing as opposed to
traditional grocery retailing, which compares to 79.0% for Eastern and Western Europe, 86.6% for Germany,
78.7% for Spain and 89.6% for the UK. The share of modern grocery has decreased at a rate of 0.4 ppts per annum
in the last 5 years in France.

The Hypermarket channel is on the decline in France, with a decline in Retail Sales Value (“RSV”) of (0.1%) per
year between 2013-18. Several players have decreased or have announced their intention to decrease the area
contribution of their hypermarket operations (e.g. Casino reduced its hypermarkets sales area from 916,000 square
meters in 2016 to 848,000 square meters in 2018. Carrefour announced in February 2019 its target of 400,000
square meters sales area reduction worldwide by 2022).

143


-----

In the meantime, organic product specialist retailers, driven by a premium development trend, are supporting high
growth in the grocery retail market, and have recorded robust growth on the back of consumer preference for
organic products. Organic products’ healthy sales and high margins have encouraged modern grocery retailers to
develop their own organic corners and private label lines. This has led major players to buy smaller organic
specialist retailers (e.g. Les Mousquetaire’s acquisition of a minority share in Les Comptoirs de la Bio, Naturalia’s
development for Casino, and Carrefour’s acquisition of So’Bio). Such deals are a way to attract additional
consumers with differentiated and more engaging products.

As more and more people live in urban areas, format diversification is required to reach urban consumers not
interested in hypermarkets on the edge of towns. In order to benefit from urbanisation and concentration of highincome households around cities, grocery retailers have developed their convenience and proximity formats to
cater to consumers’ demands for convenience, accessibility, as well as premium and tailored offering. The
convenience format has proven to be highly attractive and carries on attracting more consumers that are less
sensitive to price.

**_Grocery Retail – Market Structure and Competitive Landscape_**

Key domestic modern grocery retailers in France, which have a significant nationwide presence, include
Carrefour, Intermarché, Système U, E Leclerc, Auchan Group and Casino. These grocery retailers are the six
biggest in terms of market shares grocery retailers measured across all channels and also in the specific modern
grocery retail segment.

Casino is a leading player ranked #5 in terms of market share in modern grocery retail in 2018. With the Horizon
supply network joint venture, which Casino has established with Auchan, these two players combined are the

The Food and Drink Internet Retailing penetration rate of Grocery Retailing in France is very low (3.0%,
according to Euromonitor), albeit growing fast (the Food and Drink Internet Retailing market grew at a CAGR of
10.7% between 2014 and 2018 vs. 1.5% CAGR for Grocery Retail over the same period, according to
Euromonitor). As an example, c.20% of e-buyers made an online food purchase in 2018 according to Fevad/CSA/

According to Fevad, Clothing / fashion products are among the products the most purchased on the internet
followed by cultural products (50% of e-buyers), high-tech and household appliances are also widely purchased
online (38% of e-buyers) and e-buyers made on average 39 online transactions with €2,420 value per e-buyer in
2018.

The grocery e-commerce segment remains anchored around existing major grocery retail players as it has grown
through the development of drive formats (e.g. Leclerc Drive, Carrefour Drive) and click-and-collect stores with
dedicated areas with vehicle runways and collection points, mostly close to hypermarkets. The segment has also
grown through grocery delivery partnerships (e.g. the partnership between Amazon and Casino) mostly developed
for proximity and convenience stores.

Online marketplaces have gained considerable share in the e-commerce competitive landscape. This is driven by
retail sales value remaining concentrated around a few websites with the widest reach and largest sales. This
phenomenon is accentuated by the emergence of international marketplaces which can mutualize costs thanks to
high volume traded, and offer competitive prices while keeping margins constant. In addition to Amazon, some
players like Cdiscount, vente-privee.com and eBay have successfully established marketplace operations. On
September 23, 2019, Cdiscount announced the launch of a European platform to compete with Amazon, along
with the other e-commerce players mentioned in the foregoing sentence (source: the International Marketplace
_Network)._

Cdiscount is one of the leaders in e-commerce in France. It is the #2 internet retailer in terms of market share at a
total e-commerce level in 2018 including sales via Cdiscount’s marketplace, and Cdiscount’s own sales. Amazon
is the leader in terms of market share in the e-commerce segment.

**_Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency_**

Through its subsidiary GreenYellow, Casino is present in the energy industry, more specifically in the
photovoltaic energy industry. The key drivers of the energy transition, driving GreenYellow’s business model are
the following: rapidly increasing share of decarbonized energy sources, strong regulatory incentives for
renewables and energy savings, shift from centralized to decentralized energy production units and customers’
willingness to reduce their energy bills whilst limiting capex, therefore benefitting energy efficiency agreements
(“EEAs”).

There are three main cost reduction drivers for renewable power, which GreenYellow aims to be well positioned
on: economies of scale and competitive procurement, technology improvements, and mature client base.
In the alternative/photovoltaic energy market, the market shares of alternative energy suppliers keep growing
since the end of the EDF monopoly in 2007. In France, the gigawatt (“GW”) photovoltaic (“PV”) installed
capacity grew at a CAGR of 13% over 2012-2017, and should grow at a CAGR of 11% over 2017-2035, faster
than all other energy sources (Source: Boston Consulting Group).

In terms of energy efficiency, France is engaged in an energy efficiency plan, aiming at reducing its final energy
consumption to 131.4 million-ton equivalent of petroleum (“Mtep”), and to 219.9 Mtep for primary energy (art.
3 of Directive 2012/27/EU) (Source: Rapport de la Direction Générale de l’Energie et du Climat – Service du

2020 similar to all the other European countries (source: European Commission).

**Brazil**

**_Macroeconomic and Demographic Overview_**

In 2018, the nominal GDP of Brazil amounted to BRL 6,826 billion ($1,868 billion) (source: IMF). The IMF
ranked Brazil as the largest economy in South America. The Brazilian economy grew 1.1% in real terms in 2018,
is projected to grow 2.1% in real terms in 2019, and at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2018-24 (source: IMF).
Brazil is the most populated country in South America. As of January 1, 2018, the population of Brazil amounted
to 208.3 million people (source IMF). The Brazilian population is expected to reach 216.3 million by 2024, which
implies a 0.6% CAGR between 2018-24 (source: IMF).

Brazil’s economy suffered a severe political and economic crisis in mid-2014 that only ended in 2016. During
that period, Brazil fell into recession for two years, hit by the fall in commodity prices and demand (driven by
slowdown of the Chinese economy) and an internal political crisis that has undermined investor confidence. Since
then, inflation has decreased significantly from 8.7% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2018, resulting in slower growth in cost
of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and transport (source: IMF). Inflation is forecast to grow at a 4.0%
CAGR during 2019-24 (source: IMF). It is a highly urbanised country, where 87% of the population lives in cities
_(source: World Bank). Brazilian unemployment rate was 12.3% in 2018, is projected to fall to 11.4% in 2019 and_
further fall to 10.2% in 2020 (source: IMF).

**_Grocery Retail – Key Trends_**

While hypermarkets have long been used as anchor outlets in shopping centers in Brazil, a growing number of
supermarkets and convenience stores are also opting for such locations. Shopping centers play a strong role in the
Brazilian consumer culture, being not only a place for shopping but also entertainment. By seeking mall
expansion, supermarket and convenience store players seek to take advantage of the high consumer traffic and
shared expenses associated with these areas.

Cash & carry is a strong format in Brazil, catering not only to smaller retailers, small consumer foodservice players
and other businesses, but also individual consumers. The channel has benefited from rising consumer price
sensitivity as a result of past volatility in consumer purchasing power in the country, with Brazilians increasingly
prioritising price over convenience.

Informal retailing is also widely popular in Brazil. Consumers are not only attracted by the lower prices, but also
by the convenience offered by informal retailing, with street hawkers and markets focused on high-traffic areas,
as well as high-traffic transportation hubs – mostly underground and over-ground trains.

2018 saw a significant increase in digitalization in Brazil, with the development of online delivery platforms,
online services such as music and film streaming, as well as online shopping. Brazilians can now pay for these
services via increasingly popular digital wallets. Some grocery retailers have also participated in the evolution of
this trend, with several initiatives such as in-store Wi-Fi, electronic purchasing and click-and-collect initiatives.

**_Grocery Retail – Overview of Key Formats from Euromonitor_**

In 2018, 59.0% of Brazilian grocery retail sales were accounted for by modern grocery as opposed to traditional
grocery. The share of modern grocery has increased at a rate of 1.5ppts per annum in the last 5 years (from 51.5%
in 2013), and the modern grocery retail sales are expected to grow at a rate of 3.6% per annum in the next 5 years.
Brazil has seen strong development of atacarejo (a hybrid of a supermarket/hypermarket and a cash and carry)
over the past years, with a 16.0% CAGR for the period 2013-18. Many consumers and businesses in Brazil make
little distinction between warehouse clubs (such as Sam’s Club, the only warehouse club brand operating in the
country) and atacarejo players. In Brazil, the leading atacarejo are Assaí (Casino), Atacadão (Carrefour), WalMart Brasil’s Maxxi and Makro, although there are also many independent operators in this channel.

**Colombia**

**_Macroeconomic and Demographic Overview_**

In 2018, the nominal GDP of Colombia amounted to COP 984,803 billion ($333 billion) (source: IMF). The IMF
ranked Colombia as the 4[th] largest economy in South America. The Colombian economy faced a growth slowdown
in recent years (2.1% GDP’s growth in 2016, and 1.4% in 2017), but it is now recovering with a growth of 2.7%
in real terms in 2018, and is projected to grow 3.5% in real terms in 2019, and at a CAGR of 3.7% between 201824 (source: IMF). Growth is projected to accelerate, led by continued monetary policy support, election-year
spending by sub-national governments, implementation of the 4G infrastructure agenda, and a positive impact of
recent tax policy changes on investment.

As of January 1, 2018, the population of Colombia amounted to 49.8 million people (source IMF). Colombian
population is expected to reach 52.8 million people by 2024, which implies a 1.0% CAGR between 2018-24
(source: IMF). 81% of the country’s population live in cities _(source: World Bank). The Colombian_
unemployment rate was 9.7% in 2018, is projected to remain stable at 9.7% in 2019 and fall to 9.5% in 2020
(source: IMF).

Inflation has been stable around its target, falling close to 3.0% for the first time in four years. Two-year inflation
expectations remain anchored near the central bank’s inflation target. Inflation is forecast to grow at 3.1% per
annum for 2019-24 (source: IMF).

**_Grocery Retail – Key Trends_**

The improvement of economic conditions, the upbeat expectations of both traders and consumers, as well as
declining uncertainty regarding the socio-political climate after the presidential elections in 2018, resulted in
increased consumption expenditure by locals. In 2018, retailing in Colombia showed a progressive outlook in
terms of consumption by adapting to tax changes, rising prices, and adjustments in households that changed
consumers’ purchasing behaviour, allowing them to regain confidence in acquiring a greater number of durable
goods. Combined with the strengthening of the relation to price, quality and benefits in their shopping experiences,

the downward trend present in 2017 appears to have dissipated and the confidence of Colombians can be translated
into stronger consumption.

Consumers can easily access retailers in Colombia when they are located near their homes or workplaces, which
is true especially for grocery retailers. For non-grocery specialists, consumers commonly visit shopping centers,
which are perceived to offer greater safety when shopping; malls are redefining their concept towards family
entertainment where people can shop, eat and spend leisure time.

The arrival of discounters in Colombia has decreased the popularity of convenience stores, which are seen as more
expensive but with a smaller offer. Discounters appeal to both low- and high-income consumers, and have adapted
well to consumers’ needs and benefited from slowing household consumption, as well as decreasing brand loyalty.
The discounter channel has displayed very strong growth rates in recent years of 37.3% CAGR between 2013-18,
according to Euromonitor.

Cash & Carry is in an early development stage in Colombia and, although it started as a central market for the
institutional market, has been developing towards households consumption. Among the most important brands
are Makro (with 130 stores in Latam) and Casino’s Grupo Éxito, which entered the segment with Surtimayorista
in 2016 (144 stores by the end of 2018), aiming to attract those who buy high product volumes to sell them on or
process. These two important players plan to open outlets throughout the country.

**_Grocery Retail – Overview of Key Formats from Euromonitor_**

slightly to 8.1% in 2019 and fall to 7.9% in 2020 (source: IMF).

**_Grocery Retail – Key Trends_**

The market has been shifting from focus on traditional grocery towards modern grocery operators, which are
expected to take over as the leading channel by 2020. Supermarkets chains account for the largest sales value
share amongst the modern grocery retailers. However, it has to be noted that convenience stores displayed a high
growth over the past years and are expected to display a 4.8% CAGR between 2018-2023 according to
Euromonitor.

Modern grocery retailers are increasingly working with mobile apps to offer their products through this different
channel; however, traditional grocery retailers, which at this point in time still account for the largest value share
amongst grocery retailers, remain reluctant to venture into internet retailing, as the majority of them are small
businesses, without the capacity to invest in mobile apps.

The largest grocery manufacturers and importers have their own distribution networks, whilst smaller ones usually
operate through wholesalers with countrywide coverage that reaches small grocery retailers and foodservice
outlets with their sales forces.

**_Macroeconomic and Demographic Overview_**

In 2018, the nominal GDP of Argentina amounted to Argentine peso 14,567 billion ($518 billion) (source: IMF).
The IMF ranked Argentina as the 3[rd] largest economy in South America. The economy fell into recession in 2018.
The strong peso depreciation around mid-2018 severely fuelled inflation (34.3% of inflation in 2018 and 43.7%
of inflation forecast for 2019 according to the IMF), reducing disposable income and investor confidence.
Argentina is currently running out of hard currency while grappling with high inflation and economic contraction.
The IMF stepped in to assist Argentina with a $44 billion funding arrangement. On September 1[st], 2019, Argentina
imposed currency controls in an attempt to stabilise markets. As such, firms will have to seek central bank
permission to sell pesos to buy foreign currency and to make transfers abroad, which will impact foreign trade.
Consumers will need to seek permission from the central bank to purchase more than $10,000 a month. These
measures will apply until the end of 2019.

As of January 1, 2018, the population of Argentina amounted 44.6 million people (Source: IMF). The Argentinian
population is expected to reach 47.6 million by 2024, which implies a 1.1% CAGR between 2018-24 (source:
_IMF). 92% of the country’s population live in cities (source: World Bank). The Argentinian unemployment rate_

We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed an omni-channel offering that we believe has favorably
positioned us to respond to consumer trends. We have developed partnerships with innovators such as Amazon
and Ocado in order to provide best-in-class grocery delivery services in France. Our pure-play e-commerce
platform, Cdiscount, is the second largest e-tailer in France by number of unique monthly visitors (“UMV”), and
has allowed us to offer a range of adjacent business-to-consumer and business-to-business services. In France,
Brazil and Colombia, our brick-and-mortar retail banners benefit from mobile applications and other e-commerce
functionality that allow us to provide targeted promotions to our customers and give our customers the flexibility
to shop how they want, when they want.

In addition to our retail operations, we have also developed a number of other complementary lines of business
that allow us to leverage our know-how while monetizing our asset base. These businesses include real estate
development and shopping center management, consumer finance, solar energy and energy efficiency solutions
via GreenYellow and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via 3W.relevanC and
ScaleMax, respectively.

We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although
through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other
international markets.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, without giving effect to the impact of IFRS 16, we generated €36,659
million in net sales and €1,757 million in EBITDA and our France Retail segment recorded net sales of €18,796
million and EBITDA of €903 million. Our E-commerce segment recorded net sales of €1,979 million and
EBITDA of €28 million for the same period.

**History**

Our origins date back to 1898, when Geoffroy Guichard created Société des Magasins du Casino and opened the
first store in Veauche, in central France. In 1901, we created France’s first private label. Our network quickly
expanded in the Saint-Étienne region, around Clermont-Ferrand and on the Côte d’Azur. By 1939, we managed
nine warehouses, 20 production plants and 2,500 retail outlets.

From the 1950s onwards, we began to diversify our formats and activities. We successively opened our first selfservice store, our first Casino supermarket and our first Géant hypermarket before creating the Casino cafeterias.

Starting in the 1980s, in response to an increasingly competitive retail environment, we began to strengthen our
operations in France and refocus on our core business as a retailer. Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri became our majority
shareholder in 1991. In 1992, we acquired Rallye’s hypermarket, supermarket and cafeteria retail activities. In
1997, we acquired a stake in Monoprix-Prisunic and took control of the Franprix-Leader Price banners.

As the year 2000 approached, we were one of France’s leading retailers and were poised to expand our
international operations. Between 1998 and 2002, we acquired a number of retailers based in Latin America,
Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Notably, in 1999, we acquired minority stakes in the Colombian Grupo
Éxito and Brazilian GPA companies. In France, we consolidated our positioning in convenience and discount
formats. In 2000, we acquired a stake in Cdiscount, an online retailer. We simultaneously developed
complementary businesses with the creation of Banque Casino in 2001. In 2005, Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri became
our Chief Executive Officer. That same year, our shopping center properties in France were spun off through the
creation and initial public offering of the Mercialys property company, in which we continue to hold 25% of
voting rights today.

-----

Over the following decade, we decided to refocus our portfolio of international operations and concentrate our
development efforts on markets where we were poised to hold leading positions. With this strategy in mind, we
strengthened our positions in France and Latin America by becoming the majority shareholder of Grupo Éxito in
2007 and of GPA in 2012 and by gaining exclusive control of the Monoprix group in 2013. At the same time, we
disposed of certain activities, such as through the sales of our operations in the Netherlands, Poland, Taiwan,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

In France, we are consolidating our position in leading formats and entering into partnerships with key players in
our field to strengthen our omni-channel strategy, particularly in the food segment. For example, in 2017 and
2018, we formed partnerships with Ocado and Amazon, respectively, for next-day and same-day express delivery.
In 2018, Monoprix acquired online fashion and personal goods retailer Sarenza, through which we intend to
expand our e-commerce channel.

In parallel, we have developed new business lines that leverage our operational expertise and monetize our asset
base. For example, in 2009, we founded GreenYellow, a solar power generation and energy efficiency company.
GreenYellow has since grown into a leader in the provision of solar energy to small and medium enterprises in
France. In 2018, we further expanded GreenYellow’s operational flexibility by selling a minority stake in the
company to Bpifrance and Tikehau Capital.

As we continue to reinforce our positioning in key markets and evaluate our asset portfolio, we have implemented
further disposals of assets that no longer align with our strategic positioning, including our current asset disposal
plan, which is targeted at €2.5 billion, and in respect of which we have already signed agreements for disposals
totaling €2.1 billion. Disposals under this plan have so far included, among others, the sale of 15% of the share
capital of Mercialys through an equity swap for €213 million, the €150 million GreenYellow capital increase
subscribed by Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance and the sale and leaseback of Monoprix real estate assets for €742
million. We have also entered into sale and leaseback transactions with funds managed by Fortress Investment
Group and Apollo Global Management for certain groups of our stores.

In addition to this €2.5 billion disposal plan, we announced in August 2019 a new €2.0 billion disposal plan in
France relating to further non-strategic real estate and other assets that we have identified, which we expect to
complete by the end of the first quarter of 2021 (together with the €2.5 billion disposal plan described above, the
“Asset Disposal Plan”). Such additional disposals will be focused on increasing our exposure to better-performing
formats (such as, e.g., e-commerce and premium and convenience stores) and demographically favorable regions
in France (such as, e.g., the Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur regions).

We regularly evaluate opportunities for, and may engage in, significant disposals in the future in addition to the
Asset Disposal Plan.

In 2019, we have the objective to increase the profitability of our retail business in France by attempting to improve
purchasing conditions, reduce our cost base, sell or close loss-making stores and encourage the development of
new businesses. We aim to further deleverage in France. In addition to the Asset Disposal Plans and the Rocade
Plan, we also have the objective to improve our generation of free cash flow before interest and dividends in
France by implementing action plans to reduce our inventories and, as a result, improve our working capital and
keep our capital expenditures under strict control. We also intend to improve the profitability of Cdiscount, mainly
through attempting to develop the marketplace, which generally exhibits higher margins than other Cdiscount
sales. Finally, GPA and Grupo Éxito also aim to improve their profitability in 2019.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading position in the French food retail market through structurally well-positioned formats and offers_**
**_aligned with new consumer trends_**

We believe that we are poised to take advantage of a number of favorable consumer trends in French food retail
as an already established market leader positioned in dynamic geographic areas and rapidly growing market
segments.

We hold leading positions in the French food retail market, the largest grocery retail market in Western Europe in
terms of retail sales value (“RSV”) (based on partial-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate retail value
measured by retail selling price, excluding sales tax), according to Euromonitor International. The RSV of the
French grocery retail market (in nominal terms and applying a constant 2018 exchange rate) has consistently
grown every year since 2014, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2018 and 2023. The graph
below shows RSV growth in the RSV of the French grocery retail market from 2014 to 2018, the RSV and its

historical growth rate in the German, British, Italian and Spanish grocery retail markets, and their respective
projected growth rates between 2018 and 2023, according to Euromonitor.

(1) Euromonitor International

According to Euromonitor International, we are the fifth largest food retailer in France, with a market share of
approximately 9.4% in 2018 (based on partial-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate retail value measured
by retail selling price, excluding sales tax). As of June 30, 2019, we had a network of 8,640 stores in France within
a diversified portfolio of 12 complementary banners, each with different strategies to meet changing consumer
expectations. Our portfolio of banners is particularly focused on convenience and premium formats, which
accounted for over 60% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and address growing demand from
French consumers. We are a leading urban convenience food retailer in France, with a network of 6,801 premium
and convenience stores that have a distinct urban focus. Approximately 63% of our France Retail net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2018 were generated in three of the fastest growing regions of France – the Ile-deFrance, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur regions – whose population accounted for 35.7% of the
total French population and approximately 48% of France’s GDP growth in 2018. The map below shows our net
sales in each of these key regions as of December 31, 2018.

In addition, we are the major French food retailer with the smallest exposure to the declining hypermarket format
(which accounted for 25% of our France Retail net sales in 2018). Finally, according to a third-party market
analysis, we were also the second largest retailer of organic products, with approximately €1.0 billion in net sales
from organic products in 2018, which represented growth of 16% over the prior year.

(1) Expressed as a percentage of France Retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(2) Sourced from Euromonitor International.

(3) Convenience segment includes other activities, Vindémia and catering.

(4) There is no available market share information on organic formats. As a result we believe that our market shares in the Convenience and
premium segments are underestimated. Our banners classified as Convenience stores by Euromonitor include Vival, Monop’, Casino
Shop and Petit Casino.

(5) Hypermarket statistics for Casino excluding Cdiscount counter shops.

(6) Casino banners classified as supermarkets by Euromonitor International include: Monoprix, Franprix and Casino Supermarkets.

(7) Represents two-year average same store sales growth due to unavailability of 2016 data.

(8) CAGR shown here refers to Convenience only as defined by Euromonitor International.

We believe that the French food retail market is characterized by a number of demographic characteristics that
are favorable for food retailers like our Group. For example, according to the IMF, the French population has
grown at a CAGR of 0.3% from 64.0 million people in 2014 to 64.7 million people in 2018, and population growth
is expected to accelerate to a CAGR of 0.5%, reaching to 66.5 million people by 2024, which necessarily means
an increase in the consumer base for food. Moreover, according to the World Bank, approximately 80% of
France’s inhabitants in 2018 lived in urban areas, favoring retailers that have a particular concentration in towns
and cities. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 53% of our stores in France were located in urban areas and
approximately 1,400 stores (including franchise and affiliate stores) operated in the Paris region alone. In addition,
according to the INSEE, approximately 33% of the French population is older than 55 years old. This segment of
the population drives an estimated 86% of food retail growth and buys an estimated 57% of fresh products, the
offer of which is a key differentiating factor among food retailers and a key source of profitability. Growth in the
French food retail market is moderate, but marked by a strong polarization of format performance, with
convenience stores expected to enjoy growth in net sales of 1.6%, supermarket net sales growth expected to be
flat and hypermarket net sales expected to decline by 1.5% in 2019. In light of our strong focus on the convenience
and premium formats and our low exposure to the hypermarket format, we expect to benefit disproportionately
from the trends favoring supermarkets and convenience formats when compared with our main competitors.

The French food retail market is also marked by consumer trends that we believe will be beneficial for our Group.
For example, we believe that food retail e-commerce has the potential to grow significantly in France due to its
current low level of penetration despite the high overall population of internet users in France. According to
information from Hootsuite, approximately 88% of the French population used the internet in 2018, with 75%
using the internet on their mobile devices and 58% active on social media. While online sales of food products
are typically lower than those of non-food products, our e-commerce food sales in France, excluding Cdiscount,

155


-----

but including sales through our partnership with Amazon, amounted to €315 million in 2018. We believe this
provides us with a significant food retail e-commerce growth opportunity. Furthermore, consumers are
increasingly leaning toward high-quality, organic goods, leading to stronger emphasis on the premium end of the
market and a decline in the mass market segment. We believe this is favorable for retailers like us, with a diverse
range of banners and an already strong position in sales of organic products. We are the only large food retailer
in France with a large-scale banner dedicated to organic products, Naturalia.

We believe that these market trends have led to the emergence of new competitors, such as physical retailers Bio
c’Bon, Biocoop and La Vie Claire in the organic retail space, Grand Frais in the fresh produce space and Action
in the discount segment; online generalist retailers like Amazon and pure players such as Nespresso and Zooplus;
business-to-consumer technology platforms that are last-mile competitors such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Frichti
and Glovo. However, we also believe that our product offering and partnerships with online retailers and delivery
services will help us answer customers’ needs and successfully face such competition.

**_Best-in-class omni-channel strategy: pioneer of food e-commerce and one of the leading non-food e-tailers_**

We are present in three e-commerce retail segments in France: food retail, through the development of our omnichannel strategy, household goods, through Cdiscount, and fashion and other personal goods, through the recent
acquisition of Sarenza by Monoprix.

E-commerce activity is an important area of development for our business, especially in light of market trends
that indicate that consumers will make an increasing share of their purchases online. Our online sales for the six
months ended June 30, 2019 in France under our retail banners, together with Cdiscount’s gross merchandise
value, grew by 10.2% as compared to the same period in 2018. Food e-commerce gross sales, including
Cdiscount’s sale volume, grew by 27.5% in the first half of 2019 as compared to the first half of 2017. We
generated €187 million in net sales under our banners in food e-commerce during the six months ended June 30,
2019, and Cdiscount’s gross merchandise volume (“GMV”) was €1.75 billion over the same time period.

We were a first-mover in French food retail e-commerce through home delivery service partnerships that we
formed with Amazon and Ocado. Through our partnership with Amazon, Amazon Prime customers are offered
express two-hour delivery of Monoprix, Casino and Naturalia products in Paris and 35 neighboring cities. We
intend to expand the geographic area covered by this service to other major French cities by 2020. Through our
exclusive partnership with Ocado in France, we expect Monoprix to benefit by 2020 from a front-to-back online,
solution with the ability to provide customers with next-day delivery of 50,000 items with low preparation and
delivery costs, due in part to the construction of an automated warehouse in the Paris region.

We have further enhanced our brick and mortar French food retail operations with a number of digital initiatives.
For example, each of our principal French retail banners has a mobile application enabling customers to do their
shopping or monitor their loyalty card online. As of December 31, 2018, our banners’ applications have been
downloaded approximately 10 million times. Users of our Casino Max app generated approximately 13% of our
hypermarket and supermarket net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Furthermore, we have
implemented a number of digital solutions to enhance our customers’ shopping experience, such as permitting
mobile payments, digital receipts, and scan and go solutions through the Monoprix and Casino Max mobile apps.
Our banners’ apps also allow individual marketing capabilities, with personalized, targeted coupons and discounts,
which we believe is a key distinguishing factor from most of our competitors.

Cdiscount, our pure-play e-commerce platform, is the second-largest e-tailer in France by number of unique
monthly visitors, with an average of 19.6 million monthly unique visitors to its website during the second quarter
of 2019, based on a market study by Médiamétrie. In 2018, the difference in market share based on retail sales
value excluding sales tax between Amazon, the e-tailer with the largest share of the non-food products ecommerce market in France, and Cdiscount, the e-tailer with the second-largest share of the non-food products ecommerce market non-food e-tailer in France, is the smallest when compared to the difference between Amazon
and other European non-food e-tailers’ market share in their home markets. Cdiscount sold €3.6 billion in GMV
of products and services during the year ended December 31, 2018, of which 34% was sold by third-party
merchants through Cdiscount’s marketplace platform. The GMV contribution from products and services sold
through the Cdiscount marketplace has increased over recent years, from 32% of total GMV in 2017 to 34% in
2018 and 40% during the three months ended June 30, 2019. Cdiscount’s online marketplace is the most profitable
portion of its operations because Cdiscount is able to generate net sales through the commissions it receives from
marketplace sellers with limited associated operating costs or working capital investments. We aim to continue to
expand the share of GMV represented by the Cdiscount marketplace in the coming years.

We believe Cdiscount benefits from a strong competitive advantage through its nine million active customers and
its successful Cdiscount à Volonté loyalty program, through which over two million members have the ability to
have free one-day delivery of more than 280,000 items, with on-demand delivery within 30-minute time slots in

156


-----

Paris, as well as unlimited online access to 200 magazines. The delivery offerings through Cdiscount à Volonté
are made possible by our superior logistics infrastructure, which is capable of handling both heavy and small
products.

We have been able to leverage the Cdiscount platform to offer adjacent business-to-customer services, such as
discount travel, event ticketing, discount energy (through a partnership with GreenYellow), Coup de Pouce
consumer finance loans through its partnership with Banque Casino and insurance. We have also been able to
offer business-to-business services, including fulfilment services to our marketplace vendors, which accounted
for approximately 21% of Cdiscount’s marketplace GMV in 2018, and additional services, such as advertising
and visibility-boosting services. We intend to further develop and expand such service offerings in the future.

Finally, we have been able to roll-out Cdiscount’s reach beyond France to 25 countries in Europe, and have
established partnerships with 45 online European marketplaces as of September 2019. We intend to further expand
Cdiscount’s international operations in the future, such as through initiatives like International Marketplace
Network, our recent alliance with three online marketplaces – in each of Germany, Italy and Romania – that allows
marketplace vendors in each geographic region to access the wider consumer market of all four websites.

Our e-commerce ambitions are not limited to our sales of food products and Cdiscount alone. For example, in
2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, a website dedicated to the sale of shoes, fashion and other personal goods.
Monoprix intends to integrate and develop Sarenza as a key online player in the personal goods retail sector in
France.

**_Asset-light model and further acceleration in new businesses_**

In recent years, we have focused on developing an asset-light business model in France through the active
management of our real estate portfolio and encouraging the development of a franchisee network in stores across
our various French banners. We also have developed new lines of business, including solar energy, data analysis
for digital advertising and data centers, that take advantage of our physical footprint and accumulated know-how
from running a major retail group.

We believe that there is limited upside potential from the valuation of commercial real estate in France, and have
undertaken significant disposals of our real estate portfolio, including through entering into sale and leaseback
transactions. As of December 31, 2018, the market value of our owned real estate portfolio in France was estimated
to be approximately €2.6 billion, including transfer duties and excluding our share of property held by Mercialys,
a property development business in which we hold 25% of the voting rights. During 2019, we have sold, or entered
into agreements to sell, real estate assets for a total sales price of €750 million (excluding transfer duties). We
believe these disposals have strengthened our balance sheet, as we anticipate limited or no upside on the valuation
of commercial real estate assets in France, while giving us the operational flexibility to compete in a dynamic
competitive environment.

As for the real estate that we have retained, we have endeavored to upgrade our properties, including our Casino
Supermarkets and Monoprix stores, to improve customers’ shopping experience and boost sales. We have further
reduced average selling area in our hypermarkets by 11% from 2015, through space optimization and
specialization on premises, such as transforming selling or stocking areas into additional retail areas in shopping
centers that are adjacent to our hypermarkets and can be leased to third parties. As a result, based on information
from LSA Conso, the average selling area of our hypermarkets was 6,950 square meters as of December 31, 2018,
compared with 9,184 square meters for Carrefour hypermarkets and 10,460 square meters for Auchan
hypermarkets. We expect that hypermarket sales will represent an increasingly smaller proportion of our France
total gross sales in the coming years.

We have also encouraged the development of our franchisee network as a means of transitioning to an asset-light
model with lower capital expenditures. Growth in our franchisee network has also had a positive impact on our
France Retail sales: we estimate that new franchisees (including the Quattrucci family, whose stores generated
over €300 million in gross sales in 2017, before such stores were part of our Group) joining our network of French
retail stores in 2018.

The chart below shows the number of franchise stores in our network by banner and the percentage of the total
number of stores under each banner such franchise stores represent as of June 30, 2019.

(1) Including international franchised affiliates

(2) Including Naturalia franchisees

Finally, we have developed new business lines in France that we believe will provide us with significant
opportunities to grow our revenue and further monetize our asset base. These include:

  - GreenYellow, our solar energy and energy efficiency business. We have leveraged our in-house energy
efficiency and energy savings know-how in developing GreenYellow’s business with third parties.
GreenYellow had a pipeline of 350 MWp of future solar projects as of June 30, 2019. We believe the
potential of GreenYellow’s business has been further strengthened by our successful €150 million capital
raise from Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance in 2018.

  - 3W.relevanC, our advertising business in which we use our data analysis know-how to develop targeted
campaigns for our clients. As of September 30, 2019, 3W.relevanC had a database of 33.6 million
anonymized customers, with information on their in-store and online behavior from which it can create
specific customer profiles. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and the six months ended June 30,
2019, 3W.relevanC generated €41 million and €24 million, respectively, in net sales, and we aim to
increase 3W.relevanC’s net sales going forward.

  - ScaleMax, our recent data center business, which has set up its computing services in space available in
our warehouses and in stocking areas, allowing us to offer prices that are significantly below the market
average because, among other factors, we do not need to incur additional rental or security costs.
ScaleMax’s first data center was set up in a Cdiscount warehouse in the first half of 2019.

**_Proactive portfolio management to seize market opportunities and create value_**

We actively manage our businesses, seeking disposal and acquisition opportunities where we believe we can best
derive value for our companies. We also actively seek out and enter into partnerships with third parties in order
to better serve our customers and leverage market trends.

Our Group has historically been able to benefit from our acquisitions of banners with successful formats and name
recognition in markets characterized by favorable trends. Our Group was built through a series of key acquisitions
and combinations, including our acquisition of a stake in Monoprix in 1997, the entirety of which we purchased
in July 2013, the purchase of a majority interest in Franprix and Leader Price in 1997, our acquisition of a stake
in Grupo Éxito in 1999 (in which we acquired a further stake in 2007), our investment in CBD in 1999, our
acquisition of Naturalia in 2008 and, most recently, our purchase of Sarenza in 2018.

We also have a proven history of successfully monetizing our assets through the pursuit of opportunistic disposals.
For example, in 2016, we successfully completed a disposal plan of approximately €4.0 billion through the
disposals of our businesses in Thailand and Vietnam, with significant capital gains associated with these
transactions. In June 2018, following a review of our business portfolio, we announced the launch of an asset
disposal plan covering non-core assets, in particular real estate assets, for a value of €1.5 billion to be completed
by the end of 2019. This plan complemented our already planned disposal of Via Varejo, a Brazilian appliance
retailer, the sale of which was completed in June 2019. We successfully completed the entire plan ahead of
schedule in January 2019, primarily through the execution of sale and leaseback agreements with respect to certain
of our stores’ real estate and the sale of a 15% stake in Mercialys, a commercial real estate management business
in which we have kept a 25% minority stake. We therefore decided to increase the size of the plan to a targeted

158


-----

€2.5 billion, the Asset Disposal Plan, with the additional €1.0 billion of disposals due to be completed by the first
quarter of 2020. Of this €2.5 billion amount, agreements in respect of disposals of approximately €2.1 billion have
been signed to date, of which €1.8 billion have been completed following the closing of the sale of certain real
estate assets to Apollo Global Management, Inc. on October 17, 2019 and €0.3 billion have been signed and are
to be completed. We subsequently completed a strategic review of our assets in France and announced on August
20, 2019 that we would carry out a second phase of our Asset Disposal Plan for a target amount of €2.0 billion (in
addition to the existing €2.5 billion plan described above) to be raised by the end of the first quarter of 2021 in
order to accelerate the completion of our strategic focus on the best performing formats and most promising
geographic markets. In addition to the Asset Disposal Plan, we have also begun implementing the Rocade Plan,
pursuant to which we have undertaken a thorough review of our loss-making stores and have been disposing
and/or closing such stores. As of July 24, 2019, we had signed agreements for the disposal of integrated stores for
an aggregate sales price of €233 million and intend to continue rightsizing our footprint. Moreover, on September
19, 2019, following speculative news coverage of our business strategy, we confirmed that we were in talks with
Aldi in connection with a possible transaction involving Leader Price as part of our Asset Disposal Plan described
above.

Finally, we have sought and intend to continue seeking out partnerships with third parties to expand the products
and services we provide to our customers in an efficient manner. Such partnerships include the partnership
between our Group and Amazon in France, which began in March 2018, pursuant to which Amazon Prime
customers can receive home delivery of Monoprix groceries in Paris, which has recently expanded to include
Casino and Naturalia products and which we intend to expand to locations elsewhere in France. We also have
entered into a partnership with Ocado, the world’s leading online grocery specialist, to develop a scalable, modular
end-to-end solution for an e-commerce grocery platform, including a fully automated warehouse in the Paris
region. This solution will enable us to rapidly deliver large grocery orders to online customers. Moreover, in June
2018, our Group, together with the Auchan Retail, Metro and Schiever groups, announced the signature of several
agreements establishing the Horizon purchasing alliance, which aims to focus on moving away from purely
transactional negotiations toward a collaborative, balanced and innovative type of negotiations with suppliers.
After securing approval from competition authorities, Horizon has been operational since February 2019.

**_High-growth operations in attractive Latin American markets_**

Through our interests in GPA and Grupo Éxito, we have a highly developed network of retail banners in a number
of attractive formats in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Uruguay.

The Latin American business benefits from attractive and fast-growing markets with strong underlying
macroeconomic trends, including a growing population of over 300 million, which is favorable for food retailers.
As an established player in these markets, we believe we stand to benefit from the favorable demographics of
these countries, combined with their improving economies.

Despite a high rate of urbanization, the penetration rate of modern grocery stores in these markets remains
relatively low. As a result of this, as well as the rapid development in these countries of digitalization and
urbanization rates, we expect rapid structural changes in the region. In this context, we believe that retail groups
like ours with extensive digital know-how and omni-channel capabilities are especially well-positioned to benefit
from growth in Latin America, where digital media has had an extensive impact.

In Brazil, GPA was the largest player in grocery retail and one of the largest players in the cash & carry market
in 2018, with net sales of €11,416 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and €5,914 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2019, as compared with net sales of €5,561 million for the six months ended June 30,
2018. As of June 30, 2019, GPA had a network of 1,059 stores throughout the country. GPA is active across
various formats, channels and regions of Brazil.

The chart below shows GPA’s Brazilian banners as of June 30, 2019 and their respective contribution to GPA’s
net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

According to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2019 edition, Assaí, GPA’s cash & carry banner, was one of
the country’s largest players in this segment in 2018 based on market share in terms of retail sales price excluding
sales tax at fixed euro exchange rates and B2B sales. Assaí’s have shown organic growth in net sales of over 20%
for each of the past six years and, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, Assaí’s net sales accounted for 50% of
GPA’s total net sales, an increase from 24% for the year ended December 31, 2014.

GPA is also a pioneer in food e-commerce, digital transformation and innovation in Brazil. Its digital initiatives
include:

  - James Delivery: In December 2018, GPA acquired 100% of the startup that operates the application
James Delivery, a multiservice platform for ordering and delivering various products.

  - Digital loyalty program: The “My Discount” mobile application, which enables customers to access and
use customized coupons, has been downloaded more than 9.3 million times as of June 30, 2019,
representing a large portion of GPA’s 19.3 million customers registered under loyalty programs.

  - Cheftime: At the end of 2018, GPA entered into a partnership with Cheftime, a pioneering foodtech
startup that sells individual gastronomic kits and offers customers an online subscription service.
Implemented under the Pão de Açúcar banner, Cheftime has sold over 41,000 kits sold since its launch.

  - Partnerships with startups: GPA has created an internal lab to reinforce its cooperation with startups and
achieve increased speed and efficiency in its product launches. Approximately 300 startups have been
mapped through the lab, of which 33 have been approved.

  - Microsoft: GPA has entered into a partnership with Microsoft to design a new store model, with sensors
capable of interacting with its banners’ digital platforms and additional features such as lockers, facial
recognition and self-checkout.

We operate in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina through our interests in Grupo Éxito, which generated €1,988
million in net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and €4,153 million in net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

As of June 30, 2019, Grupo Éxito operated a network of 531 stores (excluding independent affiliate stores), with
a diverse range of formats and innovative propositions. Grupo Éxito also offers consumers a complementary
offering of financial services and consumer finance options through its finance joint venture Tuya. Finally, Grupo
Éxito has successfully leveraged its significant real estate holdings by launching and growing a commercial
property development business, Viva Malls, the largest commercial property developer in Colombia, with
approximately 565,000 square meters of gross leasable area (“GLA”) as of June 30, 2019.

In Colombia, Grupo Éxito has launched several initiatives in relation to food e-commerce, digitalization and
innovation. These initiatives include:

  - Mobile applications: The Éxito and Carulla banners launched mobile applications in the first quarter of
2019 which enable customers to access customized coupons. Since their launch, the applications have
been downloaded almost 1.2 million times.

  - Rappi: Grupo Éxito has entered into a strategic partnership with Rappi, a delivery service startup, to
improve its delivery services.

  - Customer service experience: Grupo Éxito is in the process of rolling out several payment solutions to
improve its customers’ shopping experience.

Grupo Éxito, through its banners Devoto, Disco and Géant, is a leading food retailer in Uruguay. Although Grupo
Éxito offers a range of different formats in Uruguay, it has particularly focused its expansion efforts on its Devoto
Express convenience stores. In addition, Grupo Éxito has implemented an operational excellence program in order
to boost productivity and counteract the effects of inflation on operating expenses. As a result of such efforts,
Grupo Éxito’s Uruguayan operations are highly profitable, with a 7.5% EBITDA margin for the year ended
December 31, 2018.

In Argentina, Libertad is present in the Córdoba region, with 24 hypermarkets and convenience stores. Libertad
also continued to seek opportunities to optimize its real estate portfolio, with a total GLA of approximately
170,000 square meters as of December 31, 2018. We believe Libertad is the third-largest real estate player in
Argentina.

**_Extensive record of financial achievements in France_**

We have a history of successfully executing plans to improve our France Retail financial performance and
financial position. Our France Retail trading profit, excluding property development activities, has increased at a
CAGR of approximately 22% from 2014 through 2018, and its trading profit margin, calculated as a percentage
of net sales, has increased by 0.4 percentage points per year over the same time period. Our France Retail same
store net sales have also generally evolved favorably since 2014.

We have been able to reduce our combined France Retail and E-commerce net debt over the past years, from €7.1
billion as of December 31, 2014 to €2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. We believe that a significant part of this
success is due to our ability to carry out targeted asset disposals through our various disposal plans as described
above. We believe that our successful track record in executing these opportunistic disposals has not only
generated significant value through the monetization of our asset base, but has also enabled us to focus our
business model in France on a core set of activities adapted to the needs of today’s consumers.

We intend to carry out a number of initiatives to improve our France Retail free cash flow generation to support
further reductions in our net debt. For further detail on our financial strategy, see “—Our Strategies—Continue
_transformation into a less capital-intensive business model with a strong focus on improving profitability and_
_cash flow generation and proactive deleveraging in France”._

**_Highly experienced management team to drive sustainable profitable growth_**

We benefit from the expertise of a senior management team that has significant experience in grocery retail and
corporate finance. Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CGP since 2005, acquired
our indirect majority shareholder Rallye, itself a former chain of supermarkets, in 1991, and implemented its
merger with Casino in 1992. Mr. Naouri holds degrees from the École Normale Supérieure and the École
Nationale d’Administration and has a doctorate from Harvard University. We also benefit from the services of
our talented team of divisional managers, who more closely oversee the day-to-day operations of our retail banners
and our purchasing functions. Each draws upon significant experience in the retail sector and most of them have
been with our Group for many years.

**Our Strategies**

**_Accelerate leadership in convenience, organic and premium formats in France_**

We intend to capitalize on French consumer trends by further focusing on and developing our well positioned
formats and product range. We aim to adjust our mix of formats to best position our business for long-term growth.
We also aim to continue to expand our premium and convenience stores, formats which we believe will continue
to be particularly promising over the medium term, with the goal of opening 300 new stores by 2021. In particular,
to take advantage of consumers’ increased preference for organic products, we intend to develop our organic
product offering in each of our banners and speed up the expansion of our Naturalia stores. Through this and the
promotion of organic products through our digital distribution channels, including our partnership with Amazon
Prime, we believe that our net sales of organic products will continue to increase over the next few years.
Moreover, we plan to further reduce our exposure to the hypermarket format from its 21% share of France total
gross sales under banner in 2018, by focusing on our most profitable locations. With respect to the remainder of
the hypermarket portfolio, we expect to focus on initiatives to maximize real estate efficiency and area utilization.

We also plan to enhance our existing store network in France to meet changes in consumers’ tastes and needs. We
intend to continue developing new concepts and services in our stores, such as the Franprix Noé concept, which

161


-----

consists of lifestyle stores focusing on organic, healthy and fair-trade products, Le Drugstore Parisien, a
partnership with L’Oréal Paris, and Le 4 Casino, a phygital store with several digital innovations. Most recently,
we have launched a pilot store in Paris for our newest concept, Darwin, a Franprix store offering consumers a host
of conveniences, including full kitchen access, a large seating and dining area and the ability to shop for products
from other brands, such as Cdiscount and home goods retailer Hema, in store. We also intend to provide catering
services across our various banners, such as in-store salad bars and snack areas. Finally, we intend to expand our
network of autonomous Monoprix, Franprix and Casino supermarkets in order to improve customer service and
increase net sales from expanded opening hours.

**_Continue to strengthen our leadership in digital and omni-channel initiatives in France and pursue_**
**_innovations in all parts of our business_**

Innovation and digital transformations are two major axes of our development strategy. We intend to leverage
favorable consumer trends and our strong experience in digital and omni-channel offerings by increasing our focus
on efforts to expand our e-commerce activities in food retail, further developing our Cdiscount business, growing
our digital customer relationships and rolling out further innovative concepts and solutions.

Leveraging on the full deployment of our partnership with Ocado to develop a fully automated warehouse and
with the expansion of the delivery area through which Amazon Prime customers can order Monoprix, Casino and
Naturalia products, we aim to generate significant food e-commerce sales in the near- to medium-term.

In our pure-play e-commerce business, we intend to increase Cdiscount’s GMV through the further development
of our marketplace, which we expect will account for an increasing share of Cdiscount’s net sales in the coming
years. We also intend to further expand Cdiscount’s business-to-business and business-to-customer services
offering within France, and to more generally expand Cdiscount’s operations to other European countries through
direct delivery to countries neighboring France and the further development of partnerships with marketplaces
abroad.

Finally, we aim to reinforce our digital customer relationships through the increased penetration of our banners’
mobile applications. We also plan to expand Scan & Go capabilities to all of our stores by 2021.

In October 2018, we launched Le 4 Casino, the first store in France without a traditional cashier, the technology
of which was deployed over 146 stores (with 188 stores targeted by the end of 2019), allowing for 24/7 store
operation without the presence of cashiers. In March 2019, we opened a logistics innovation lab in the Géant
hypermarket in Pessac, France, where 15 technology solutions are currently being tested in partnership with the
most innovative startups in the field.

These innovative solutions were made possible with the launch of Maxit, a “digital factory” covering our various
banners, employing 40 experts in the digital field and focusing on technology innovation, such as through the
development of the Casino Max, Leader Price and Vindémia mobile applications. Since their launch, these
applications have generated traffic of more than 5 million views per month. Maxit regularly liaises with startups
to develop projects to improve the customer experience.

In addition, Cdiscount runs dozens of tests with startups each year to develop innovative solutions. For instance,
in July, Cdiscount signed a partnership with FACIL’iti to adapt its website for people with disabilities.

Our innovation initiatives also include new activities with strong growth potential, such as the deployment of
electrical vehicle charging stations in our parking lots or ScaleMax, a cloud computing solution developed in our
warehouses and store stocking areas. Each of these projects, in line with our asset-light strategy, have been
developed in exclusive or limited partnerships with the most advanced startups, franchisees with long-standing
relationships with us or with other external specialist teams.

**_Increase pace of development of new activities in France_**

We believe that our new energy and data businesses in France will provide us with significant opportunities to
grow our revenue and further monetize our asset base.

In our solar energy business, we aim to further bolster our leadership position while developing newer activities.
We aim to consolidate GreenYellow’s leadership position in solar energy with a target to increase its installed
capacity, which has already grown significantly, with an installed base of 190 MWp as of December 31, 2018 and
a pipeline representing 350 MWp of future projects as of June 30, 2019. We also aim to consolidate our leadership
position in solar self-consumption in France by continuing to leverage our joint venture partnership with Engie,
pursuant to which we help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their
electricity needs. Further, we plan to continue growing our energy performance contract offering, which is a
contract with GreenYellow through which GreenYellow commits to achieve reductions in energy costs and total

162


-----

energy consumed, with external customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had already entered into approximately
€66 million of such contracts. Finally, we intend to further develop our business-to-customer services and expand
our offering through electricity sales to individual customers via Cdiscount Energie and the development of a new
natural gas offering that we intend to launch by the end of 2019.

We also plan to continue growing our data and data centers businesses in order to increase the potential
contribution from such businesses, which generated €41 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We expect to target such growth through accelerating the development of 3W.relevanC’s core activities, as well
as expanding its retail search marketing operations, which develop advertising campaigns linked to internet users’
searches. We also intend to license our Casino Max app and its targeted coupon platform to business-to-business
customers. Finally, through our ScaleMax business, we intend to generalize the use of data centers in our logistics
warehouses and hypermarket stocking areas.

**_Encourage fast growth in Latin America_**

We intend to grow the businesses of GPA and Grupo Éxito through the execution of a range of initiatives at GPA
in Brazil and Grupo Éxito in Colombia that we believe will lead to increased net sales.

In Brazil, GPA’s strategy is centered on four key pillars:

  - Portfolio optimization: GPA intends to continue expanding Assaí cash & carry stores and associated net
sales, with a target of 20 new stores to be opened by year-end. GPA also intends to revitalize and revamp
its other Brazilian banners, through converting certain Extra supermarket stores into Compre Bem and
Mercado Extra stores, renovating its Pão de Açúcar stores and improving the attractiveness of its
commercial retail spaces.

  - Review of our product range: GPA aims to increase the proportion of private-label products in its sales
mix through repositioning its Qualitá private label brand. In 2018, GPA introduced 500 new products,
worked closely with its suppliers to ensure higher production levels to improve profitability and launched
a new marketing model and promotional campaigns.

  - Digital transformation: GPA intends to increase revenue by continuing to pursue its digital and ecommerce initiatives, including through the deployment of delivery platform James Delivery in São
Paulo and 10 other cities by the end of 2019, expansion of GPA’s Cheftime application delivering meal
kits to the São Paulo region of Brazil and extending GPA’s click and collect and home delivery services
to a greater number of stores.

  - Operation / efficiency: GPA has developed a number of initiatives to optimize its gross margin, including
increasing the proportion of higher-margin product offerings, investing in tools to optimize pricing in
each of its store formats and regions and customizing promotions for a better return on investment.

We intend to continue Grupo Éxito’s transformation strategy through carrying out a number of different initiatives.

  - Focus on fast-growing formats: Grupo Éxito plans to expand the recently introduced cash & carry format
in Colombia through the additional openings and conversion of existing stores into stores under the
Surtimayorista banner. Grupo Éxito also intends to continue launching new concepts in Colombia, such
as the Éxito WOW concept in its hypermarkets, which offers a complete revamp of its food and nonfood product selection, and the FreshMarket concept in its Carulla premium supermarkets, with an
improved selection of fresh and healthy products.

  - Digital transformation: Grupo Éxito believes that local market conditions are favorable for the
development of omni-channel marketing solutions, including increased e-commerce, retail mobile
applications and last-mile delivery services. Consequently, Grupo Éxito intends to accelerate the
development of its digital and omni-channel activities in Colombia through efforts to increase the number
of users of the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications and expanding the Puntos Colombia loyalty
program application that Grupo Éxito has developed in partnership with Bancolombia with rewards that
can be used by customers at several companies.

  - Property development: Grupo Éxito plans to continue expanding its Viva Malls property development
business in Colombia, which has become the leading player in the Colombian commercial property
market.

**_Unlock additional value through simplifying our Group’s structure in Latin America_**

We are currently in the process of reorganizing the holding structure of our various Latin American holdings in
order to simplify our organization with the objective of improving the valuation of the publicly listed Latin

163


-----

American companies. On October 19, 2019, CBD announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Sendas had
published the first notice of an all-cash public tender offer to purchase any and all shares of Almacenes Éxito,
including the 55.3% of Almacenes Éxito shares indirectly held by CGP through Tevir. In addition, CGP and Onper
have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the 50% stake in Segisor, a French holding company of CBD,
held by Onper would be sold to CGP, leading to CGP being the 100% owner of Segisor. We intend to have CBD’s
shares migrated to the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 - Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. (formerly BM&F Bovespa)
stock exchange, which would entail converting CBD’s preferred shares (which are currently the shares that are
publicly listed) into ordinary shares at a one-to-one exchange ratio and aligning CBD’s corporate governance with
the stricter rules imposed by the Novo Mercado.

After the implementation of the Latam Reorganization Transactions, CGP will hold 41.4% of GPA’s shares and
GPA will control Grupo Éxito and its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Argentina. Upon completion of the Latam
Reorganization Transactions, CGP will indirectly hold 41.4% of CBD. We expect to be able to continue fully
consolidating GPA and Grupo Éxito into our consolidated financial statements. However, neither GPA, Grupo
Éxito nor their respective subsidiaries will be considered our subsidiaries for purposes of the covenants in the
Indenture. Consequently, the covenants will not restrict any actions at those entities. See “Summary—The Latam
_Reorganization Transactions”. This is expected to materially increase the liquidity of the market in GPA’s shares_
and increase their appeal to international investors.

Although we estimate that the reorganization will have a net negative cash impact on our French business of
approximately €100 million after giving effect to the repayment of €195 million under the outstanding Segisor
loan, we believe that such reorganization will eliminate the implicit holding company and corporate governance
discounts to the valuation of the Latin American businesses.

A comparison of our current Latin American shareholding structure and the intended simplified shareholding
structure following the reorganization is below.

For further information on the structure of our Group following the reorganization of the Latin American
businesses, see “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure”.

**_Continue transformation into a less capital-intensive business model with a strong focus on improving_**
**_profitability and cash flow generation and proactive deleveraging in France_**

We have launched a number of initiatives to achieve improvements in several financial metrics in France,
including our costs of operations, trading profit, capital expenditures, net debt and working capital requirements.

We intend to optimize head office expenses at the corporate level and at the level of each of our banners and
reduce store costs, continue to negotiate better purchasing conditions for goods, realize logistics synergies through
unifying the logistics serving our Casino, Franprix and Leader Price banners and close or dispose of loss-making
stores through our Rocade Plan in order to save costs. During the first half of 2019, we have already made
significant progress toward our cost savings goals. We have already achieved significant run-rate savings,
including approximately €60 million in cost savings through head office and store costs reductions of
approximately €29 million, purchasing savings of approximately €16 million and logistics synergies of
approximately €15 million, each on a full-year basis. In addition, through our progress on the Rocade Plan, we
disposed of 15 hypermarkets, 13 supermarkets and 11 Leader Price stores and closed a further 56 stores across
our various French banners, leading to a positive impact on trading profit that we estimate would be approximately
€52 million on a full-year basis. We have also disposed of eight franchised supermarkets and nine franchised
Leader Price stores and have closed 62 franchised stores, leading to an estimated positive impact of approximately
€27 million in trading profit for the franchisees on a full-year basis, with an expected €13 million of normalized

164


-----

net income for our Group. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We may not be able
_to implement our business strategy”._

We also seek to improve our France Retail trading profit through improvements in format mix and an emphasis
on organic and fresh food products, through developing retail-adjacent sources of revenue from our new
businesses GreenYellow, 3W.relevanC and Scale Max, and through the continued disposal of loss-making stores.

We are continuing to focus our retail gross capital expenditures on initiatives that we believe will have a favorable
impact on the development of our business, with a targeted level of approximately €350 million per year from
2019 through 2021. We believe this will include investments in the further digitalization of our retail activities,
such as the recent launch of the Leader Price mobile application, the development of e-commerce initiatives such
as our partnerships with Ocado and Amazon. We believe this level of capital expenditure is adequate after years
of significant investment in revamping our banners and implementing new concepts, such as the Mandarine
concept in Franprix stores, intended to transform them into friendly, practical and pleasant stores. In addition, the
development of franchises has reduced our capital expenditure requirements, as franchisees finance the capital
expenditures for the stores that they operate.

We aim to reduce our year-end net debt through continuing our favorable track record of deleveraging in France.
We intend to achieve this goal through improving our free cash flow generation, continuing the Rocade Plan,
pursuing our €4.5 billion Asset Disposal Plan and the absence of dividend payments until the end of 2020. We
believe we have made significant progress on these initiatives already, having already signed approximately €2.1
billion of asset disposals out of the announced €4.5 billion, of which transactions approximately €1.8 billion have
closed. As of July 24, 2019, we had also signed agreements for the disposal of integrated stores for an aggregate
sales price of €233 million.

Finally, we aim to improve our working capital requirements, primarily through reducing inventories. We aim to
reduce inventories through a number of different initiatives, including ceasing to offer products which are cashconsuming, extending logistics pooling between our banners, which previously had been limited to frozen goods,
to a wider range of products and closer tracking through advanced digital inventories solutions. We have already
demonstrated improvement in this respect, having generated a cash inflow from changes in inventories during the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019 of €105 million, which is an improvement on our performance in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018.

In the context of such performance and strategic positioning initiatives, we have set ourselves a target of reducing
our France Retail net debt to €1.5 billion on a sustainable basis.

_The foregoing discussion includes forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to uncertainty. Our_
_ability to realize these targets may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,_
_including the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Listing Prospectus. The occurrence_
_or exacerbation of one or more of the risks described under “Risk Factors” could have a material impact on our_
_ability to realize the targets described above. We make no undertaking to update any of the foregoing targets_
_except as required by applicable laws and regulations._

**Our Businesses**

Our business comprises both retail and non-retail operations. Primarily, we operate as a retailer, offering a wide
range of products and services in two principal geographic areas, France and Latin America, as well as through
our pure e-commerce platform (primarily in France), Cdiscount. Our products are offered through a diverse
portfolio of strategic banners and distribution channels aimed at providing our customers with a seamless multichannel shopping experience tailored to their preferences. In addition to our retail businesses, we also operate a
number of other non-retail lines of business, principally in the French and, through GPA and Grupo Éxito, Latin
American markets, that allow us to monetize some of our core assets. Our non-retail businesses operate in various
industry sectors that align with and complement our retail activities, such as solar energy, data monetization, real
estate development and management and consumer finance. Certain of our non-retail businesses are established
as joint ventures with key strategic local partners.

**_Our Retail Businesses_**

We operate retail businesses through both brick-and-mortar retail outlets and via online sales. Our operations are
established in two balanced and structured geographic regions: France and Latin America. We are generally
focused on selective international development and on high potential markets, such as Brazil and Colombia, where
GPA and Grupo Éxito hold co-leadership and leadership positions, respectively.

Our physical retail businesses operate under several banners, each of which has a distinct format. The principal
formats of our retail stores include:

165


-----

  - _supermarkets, which are large self-service stores that primarily sell food products;_

  - _convenience stores, which are small stores that typically carry everyday essential food and non-food_
products and are generally located in city and town centers;

  - _premium stores, which cater to an urban clientele, offering food products with a large proportion of fresh,_
organic options and service counters and superior quality non-food products;

  - _hypermarkets, which are stores with very large surface areas that offer a wide range of food and non-_
food goods under a single roof, typically located in suburbs and other locations outside of city centers;

  - _discount stores, which are supermarkets and convenience stores that cater to a price-sensitive clientele;_
and

  - _cash & carry stores, which offer goods on a self-service wholesale basis to customers._

As a modern major retailer operating in competitive markets, we are also focused on developing our multi-channel
pioneering position by leveraging our deep local roots to establish ourselves as a leader in the e-commerce market.
From Cdiscount’s leadership model in France, to the specific digital strategies of our banners and key partnerships
with international leaders in technology and logistics, we are committed to adapting to our customers’ changing
preferences in the global multi-channel space.

As of December 31, 2018, 7,012 stores in our network were operated by franchisees. We have franchise contracts
pursuant to which a franchisee pays a fee to license the rights to a banner, receives a fixed allowance from us to
set up the store, and then mostly purchases merchandise for sale through our central purchasing agency, on which
we earn a margin. In addition, some joint ventures have been set up between us and a master franchisee that in
turn owns one or more franchised stores.

Through franchises, we can expand our store network while pursuing our asset-light strategy. Franchising allows
us to maintain net sales while minimizing cost outlays. Through franchise contracts, we recognize net sales on the
goods we sell our franchisees through our central purchasing agency. On the other hand, overhead costs like leases
and personnel costs, as well as capital expenditures, are shared or limited. For joint venture franchises, we either
fully consolidate or recognize our share of the net income of such stores.

As part of our international strategy, we enter into partnerships in markets in which we are not present, either
through licensing our banners to affiliates in international markets or through private-label product supply
agreements. In addition, we have a number of supply agreements in place whereby we provide private-label
products to leading local retailers in various international markets. We believe that these brands can be particularly
popular with consumers, as they represent a sought-after French lifestyle.

_France_

Our France Retail operations, which include both our French food retail and non-retail businesses, are
concentrated in France, the historical birthplace of Casino Group, where we are a leading retailer. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019, our France Retail segment recorded net sales of €18,796 million and EBITDA of
€903 million (without giving effect to the impact of IFRS 16). 37.4% of our net sales for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019 was generated by hypermarkets and hard discount stores, 62.6% was generated by supermarkets,
convenience stores and premium banners.

_Retail Businesses_

Our French retail businesses serve customers through a network of 8,640 stores as of June 30, 2019. We conduct
our retail businesses within the France Retail segment under several banners, each of which offers a key range of
products that are constantly evolving to anticipate new modes of consumption and adapt to all types of customers,
local lifestyles and environments. These diverse banners present a balanced mix of activities, brands and formats,
including urban, service, convenience, hypermarket and hard discount store formats, each of which reach out to
customers through multiple channels.

Monoprix

Our premium banner, Monoprix, is the leading French omni-channel city-center retailer, aiming to maximize
convenience and customer enjoyment through providing innovative services and a differentiated offering. As of
June 30, 2019, 771 stores operated under the Monoprix banner in France and abroad. For the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019, Monoprix stores, including all of its various formats, recorded net sales of €4,538 million.

166


-----

Monoprix stores are located in more than 250 town and city centers in France and aim to provide consumers with
a diversified product offering, including both food and non-food items such as cosmetics, apparel and housewares,
from both name brands and private-label brands, all under a single roof in a modern and friendly environment.

Monoprix has also developed other formats:

  - _Naturalia a leading retailer specializing in natural and organic products, with 195 stores as of as of June_
30, 2019 offering more than 6,000 items.

  - _Monop’ an ultra-convenience concept. These practical, welcoming stores provide a varied offering that_
meets basic daily needs and provides specialty product options. Monop’ operates in busy urban areas,
including in partnership with train stations, and along motorways. As of December 31, 2018, 149 stores
operated under the Monop’ concept, catering to an active, urban clientele.

  - _Monop’Daily a concept combining fast food with ultra-fresh products. With an average selling area of_
50 to 100 square meters, Monop’Daily stores offer a broad range of snacks, ready meals, dairy products,
beverages, fruit and desserts. As of December 31, 2018, 37 stores operated under the Monop’Daily
concept.

In 2018, we ramped up Monoprix’s omni-channel strategy by signing a partnership with Amazon to offer
Monoprix grocery items with express same-day delivery to Amazon Prime Now customers in Paris. This
agreement complements Monoprix’s exclusive alliance with Ocado in France, entered into in late 2017, which
provides for the construction of an automated warehouse in the Paris suburbs for home delivery of large basket
sizes. Lastly, in 2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, an online fashion and personal goods retailer, with a view to
making Monoprix.fr a leader in the fashion and personal goods segment in France, and to consolidate its position
in non-food e-commerce.

Casino Supermarkets

Casino Supermarkets is a banner of supermarkets operating in French city centers and rural areas, focused on a
strong commitment to pleasure, taste, high-quality fresh produce, knowledgeable food service personnel, choice
and customer service, and backed up by innovative digital solutions. As of June 30, 2019, 420 stores operated
under the Casino banner, of which 112 stores were franchises. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, Casino
Supermarkets recorded net sales of €3,015 million.

Casino Supermarkets are concentrated in three primary regions of France: southeastern France, the Rhône Valley
and greater Paris. Casino Supermarkets have an average selling area of 1,740 square meters. Casino Supermarkets
offer mainly food products, including organic and fresh produce, in-house pastries and baked goods, as well as an
array of non-food products, including capsule homeware and apparel collections.

Casino Supermarkets continue to develop their omni-channel offering and novel ways of expanding customers’
digital experience. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 95% of Casino Supermarkets offered e-commerce
solutions to their customers, such as click-and-drive service, where consumers can order their groceries online
and pick them up at a drive-through or a dedicated counter. More recently, Casino Supermarkets opened Le 4
Casino in Paris, which was designed to offer customers a unique shopping experience, including a variety of
innovative digital services enabling customers to shop 24 hours a day, seven days a week without going through
a physical checkout, to easily locate products in store, to choose from a broader range of products and services

Franprix

Franprix is the Group’s main hyper-convenience banner for urban areas. Franprix stores are mainly established in
Paris and its surrounding areas, with almost all of its stores concentrated in this region, and in the heart of large
French cities in the Rhône Valley and the Mediterranean basin. As of June 30, 2019, a total of 888 stores operated
under the Franprix banner, including 443 franchises. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, Franprix stores
generated net sales of €1,566 million.

With an average selling area of 410 square meters per store, Franprix stores offer a range of food products intended
to satisfy the daily needs of consumers, combining essential national brands and private-label brands. In 2015, we
launched the Mandarine concept for Franprix stores, intended to transform them into friendly, practical and
pleasant stores. Since then, the concept has grown in line with the innovations created by the banner to drive food
service solutions, healthy and responsible ranges (e.g., scoop-and-weigh), and services aimed at giving Franprix
stores the feel of a local grocery store. These include in-store snacking areas, fresh fruit juicers, bicycle pump
access, phone charging stations, public WiFi access, in-store microwaves and quick delivery options. Ease of
access and flexible opening hours also contribute to the success of the Franprix banner, which launched its first

stores that are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week in 2018. Recently, the Franprix banner has explored new
store concepts, including Noé, which offers an increased range of organic and vegan products in an inviting
atmosphere, and Le Drugstore Parisien, a partnership with L’Oréal Paris offering a wide selection of beauty
products.

Franprix continues to focus on innovation in the food retail sector. In September 2019, it entered into a partnership
with Hema, a Dutch company specializing in low-cost trendy housing gadgets and décor, to offer Hema products
in its stores. That same month, Franprix opened a pilot store in with its new, innovative Darwin concept, which
offers customers full kitchen access, including access to pizza ovens and fryers, a large seating area, larger scoopand-weigh offerings and a selection of Hema and Cdiscount products.

Géant Casino

Géant Casino is our French hypermarket banner which offers leading food brands with high-quality traditional
food selections, local fresh produce and a large organic product range and non-food products. Géant Casino
hypermarkets provide ample retail space on a human scale, with the average area measuring approximately 6,950
square meters as of December 31, 2018, which is less than the average surface area of our hypermarket competitors
in France. As of June 30, 2019, 113 hypermarkets operated under the Géant Casino banner, of which 6 stores were
operated by affiliates in France and 5 stores were operated by affiliates outside of France. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, Géant Casino stores recorded net sales of €4,501 million.

In recent years, we have focused on our most profitable locations, reduced retail space and repositioned our Géant
Casino offering to favor product categories and channels adapted to customers’ preferences. For example, our
non-food offering is presented in a connected, user-friendly boutique format and focuses on leisure goods,
homeware and apparel collections, enhanced by in-store Cdiscount sales counters focused primarily on technical
goods. As of June 30, 2019, there were 55 Cdiscount counters in Géant Casino’s hypermarkets, which we believe
has had a positive impact on our sales. In line with its multi-channel approach and with a view to digitizing the
store experience, the banner has adopted the Casino Max app, which offers features including express scanning,
payment facilities, and targeted digital promotions.

Leader Price

Leader Price is our French banner operating stores with a hard discount retail format, and has been a major player
in the sector over 30 years. Leader Price is focused on meeting two criteria: very low prices and good-quality
products. It targets price-sensitive customers without compromising the quality of its product offerings. Leader
Price stores offer a comprehensive food range of over 5,000 items, including both private label and key nationalbrand products. A large number of Leader Price stores are operated through franchises. As of June 30, 2019, 665
stores operated under the Leader Price banner, of which 330 were franchise stores. For the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019, Leader Price stores recorded net sales of €2,320 million.

Leader Price has adapted its in-store experience to leverage its position as a discount food retailer to cater to the
ongoing price sensitivity of French shoppers, while respecting customers’ expectations for stores’ appearance and
product selection. For example, in 2018, Leader Price launched the “discount pleasure” concept, building on its
fundamental values of quality, price and efficiency to match the expectations of its customers, marked mainly by
a refreshed purchasing experience and reinforcing its offer of fresh and organic produce. The performance of
Leader Price stores has benefited from this as well as conversions to the “Next” concept, which sought to improve
customers’ in-store experience through fully redesigned retail spaces and revitalizing Leader Price stores’ fresh
produce departments.

On September 19, 2019, following speculative news coverage of our business strategy, we confirmed that we were
in talks with Aldi in connection with a possible transaction involving Leader Price.

Convenience Stores

Convenience stores round out our retail offering in France, consisting of smaller shops that are located in the heart
of towns, villages and urban centers. As of June 30, 2019, 5,142 convenience stores operated under our banners.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our convenience stores recorded net sales of €1,324 million.

Our principal convenience banners include:

  - _Le Petit Casino, which is the Group’s historical convenience format, offering an extensive range of food_
products including high-quality fresh produce in urban and suburban areas;

168


-----

  - _Vival, which operates mainly in villages. Vival stores have a food offering comprising mainly Casino-_
brand goods, as well as other useful day-to-day services, including a loyalty program, home delivery,
parcel collection, gas canister collection, in-store postal service and fresh bread; and

  - _Spar, which operates in seasonal destinations and urban and suburban areas, offering a range of_
convenience food products and related services for local, tourist and international customers.

_Non-Retail Businesses_

Our non-retail operations in France span across a range of industry sectors, including energy, digital advertising,
data solutions, real estate, fast-food services and financial services.

GreenYellow

In 2009, we created GreenYellow, a business centered on solar energy and energy efficiency. Although
GreenYellow primarily operates in France, it has expanded its operations to international markets. GreenYellow
capitalizes on our expertise in the real estate sector through our knowledge of property development, construction
and operation, as well as on the favorable geographic location of our stores, to offer public and private customers
a wide range of solutions to produce and manage their energy.

GreenYellow, which began by installing rooftop photovoltaic systems and energy efficiency solutions in our
stores, today ranks as a leading French player in rooftop photovoltaic systems, with a robust set of external clients
representing an installed base of 190 MWp as of December 31, 2018 comprising more than 150 installations
covering approximately 1,013,000 square meters of shopping center and solar canopy rooftops (mainly on sites
belonging to our Group) at the end of 2018, and a pipeline of 350 MWp of future projects as of June 30, 2019.
Based on the installed base of 190 MWp at the end of 2018, we estimate that such systems save nearly 24,200
tons of carbon dioxide per year and are sufficient to cover the annual consumption of approximately 57,000
households.

GreenYellow’s main areas of expertise include:

  - The decentralized production of energy, such as through the integration of solar panels on roofs and car
parks: GreenYellow has developed, built and operated over 150 power plants in France and
internationally, both on sites that belong to our Group as well as sites belonging to third parties, including
industrial sites, communities and businesses. One example of a GreenYellow installation is its
construction of the largest solar plant in Colombia on the roof of our Éxito Panorama store in Baranquilla.
This plant has approximately 6,300 square meters of solar panels that can produce approximately 780
MWh per year, representing approximately 24% of the site’s electricity consumption.

  - Promoting energy efficiency through energy performance contracts: Through energy performance
contracts (“CPEs”), GreenYellow offers customers an innovative solution with an energy-saving
guarantee without investment from the client and with net gains from the first year. GreenYellow installs
energy efficient installations at a client’s site, the funding for which is fully compensated by the energy
savings realized by the installations. These gains in efficiency are guaranteed over the length of the CPE
by GreenYellow, which monitors the site’s energy consumption closely.

  - Purchasing energy and monitoring consumption: GreenYellow provides purchasing and monitoring
services for over 5,000 points of consumption.

  - Supplying energy to private individuals: Since 2017, GreenYellow has provided energy directly to
consumers.

GreenYellow continues to consolidate its leadership in the photovoltaic systems market. Its installed base includes
projects with industrial customers and local authorities in France, Thailand, Colombia, Morocco and Brazil.

3W.relevanC

We created 3W.relevanC in 2018 to leverage the large amounts of quality data about our customers and their
buying habits in stores and online to which we have access as part of our food retail business operations and
Cdiscount. 3W.relevanC is focused on the production of studies on purchasing behavior, the implementation of
targeted advertising campaigns offering more tailored deals to customers and measuring the impact of these
campaigns on in-store sales. In June 2019, 3W.relevanC entered into a partnership for digital direct advertising
with Conforama, a European leader in home furnishing and building supplies. As of September 30, 2019,
3W.relevanC had a database of 33.6 million anonymized customers, with information on their online and in-store

behavior from which it can create specific customer profiles. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and the
six months ended June 30, 2019, 3W.relevanC generated net sales of €41 million and €24 million, respectively.

ScaleMax

In 2018, as part of our asset monetization strategy, we entered into a strategic partnership with Qarnot computing
to launch ScaleMax, a business that installs and operates new-generation data centers for clients in France seeking
access to high-performance computing capacity that is both sustainable and secure and can be rapidly deployed
on a large scale. In 2019, ScaleMax installed and began operating its first data center at a Cdiscount logistics
warehouse in the Greater Paris region, and as of June 30, 2019, over 10,000 cores (equivalent to approximately
1,000 servers) had already been deployed for customers other than Group entities. We expect that ScaleMax will
have signed or deployed nearly 16,000 additional cores at further data centers by the end of 2019.

Real Estate Activities

In addition to the active management of our own property portfolio (see “—Real Estate/Properties” below), we
also offer real estate ownership and management services through IGC (“Immobilière Groupe Casino”) that
owns most of our property assets, excluding shopping malls. In addition, we own a 25% stake in Mercialys, a
public company that leases and manages shopping centers and city center retail space in France. As of December
31, 2018, the market value of the Group’s owned real estate portfolio in France was estimated to be approximately
€2.6 billion, including transfer duties (and excluding our share of property held by Mercialys). As of that date,
Mercialys managed over 48 shopping centers and seven city center assets with a combined area of over 873,000
square meters. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, Mercialys recorded revenue of €191 million.

Casino Restauration

Casino Restauration is one of our subsidiary companies that was historically positioned in the fast-food segment
through its operation of a chain of fast food franchise cafeterias in France. In recent years, however, Casino
Restauration has been repositioned through new concepts, including family restaurants such as À la Bonne Heure,
themed restaurants such as Villa Plancha, take-away food, such as Coeur de Blé and events catering services such
as its St Once business line.

Casino Restauration also owned R2C, a corporate food service business, the disposal of which was completed in
the first half of 2019 as part of the Asset Disposal Plan.

Banque Casino

Created in 2001, Banque Casino is a joint venture with French bank Crédit Mutuel CIC (“CM-CIC”), of which
we own 50%, that provides consumer finance programs and insurance products to Cdiscount and Géant
hypermarket customers. It has capitalized on our long-standing retail background and on the financial solidity of
CM-CIC to become an online banking option for customers, providing them with a wide choice of credit cards,
easy terms of payment and fully accessible on-line insurance. It has also developed innovative solutions for etailers, providing them with custom-made services such as payment by installments, allowing customers to pay
for goods online through a completely digital process in three or four separate installments. In 2018, Banque
Casino served 2.7 million customers and issued over €1.7 billion in loans.

_Indian Ocean Region_

Vindémia is the subsidiary through which we conduct our business operations in the Indian Ocean region,
including Madagascar, Mayotte and Mauritius. Currently the area’s retailing leader, we have a multi-format
presence in the Indian Ocean region, positioned through hypermarkets, supermarkets, discount stores,
convenience stores and franchised stores. Our banners in the region include Douka bé, Jumbo, La Croissanterie,
Score, Score Express, Sherpa, SNIE, Supercash, SuperMaki, Spar and Vival. As of June 30, 2019, we had a total

employee representative bodies and is subject to approval by the French Competition Authority.

million (including the impact of IAS 29) and EBITDA of €826 million, without giving effect to the impact of

of our stake in Grupo Éxito was approximately €1.2 billion as of October 2019, based on the three-month volume
weighted average price of Almacenes Éxito’s shares (€4.70).

Retail Businesses

operations, we operate a pure non-food e-commerce business under the Cdiscount banner through our publicly
traded subsidiary, Cnova, in which we have 63.4% of the voting rights and a 64.8% economic interest. Cdiscount
acts as both a direct retailer and service provider to customers in 25 countries in Europe, as well as a marketplace
for third parties offering products and services to customers using Cdiscount’s hosting platform. As of
June 30, 2019, Cdiscount offered approximately 9.2 million active customers (defined as a customer having
purchased at least once through one of Cdiscount’s websites or its app during the prior twelve months) access to
a wide and growing assortment of more than 48 million product offerings, as well as a range of services. Cdiscount
is the number two e-commerce site in France in terms of UMV, attracting an average of 19.6 million UMV during
the second quarter of 2019 and 956.7 million total site visits during all of 2018. Cdiscount offers a customer
loyalty program, à Volonté, which had 2 million registered members at the end of June 2019. For the twelve

electrical and plumbing work or appliance repairs can find providers to meet their needs.

Consumers are able to purchase products on Cdiscount’s sites either directly from Cdiscount or via a marketplace
from third-party vendors. Merchants pay a monthly subscription fee for Cdiscount to host a store on one of its
websites, and Cdiscount also receives a commission on all sales carried out by third-party merchants through
Cdiscount’s marketplace, which varies based on product category and whether the product is new or used.

In addition, Cdiscount offers ancillary services to merchants using its marketplace. For example, since 2014,
Cdiscount has proposed fulfillment services to third-party sellers in France to promote the competitiveness and
growth of the Cdiscount marketplace as well as to shorten marketplace delivery times. Cdiscount’s fulfillment
services handle storage, preparation, shipping and customer service on behalf of its marketplace sellers, which
enables sellers to increase their turnover and benefit from speedy delivery and increased customer satisfaction.
Moreover, merchants can purchase monthly subscriptions to various Premium Packs, which bundle services such
as customizable online shops, activity reports and analysis. As of December 31, 2018, Premium Packs were

Cdiscount’s delivery solutions remain at the cutting edge of technology: roll-out of real time geolocation on large
parcel delivery now covers approximately 97% of Cdiscount’s order flow and on-demand delivery was launched
in June 2018.

Although Cdiscount generates a substantial majority of its net sales from online transactions, Cdiscount also has
a physical presence in certain of our French retail banners’ stores. During 2018, 45 new Cdiscount showrooms
opened in Géant hypermarkets, bringing the total network to 49 as of December 31, 2018, with further openings
planned in 2019.

Finally, to capture new clients outside its 2017 geographic footprint, Cnova has successfully expanded in Europe
through partnerships with marketplaces in foreign countries and direct deliveries from its French warehouses.
Cnova products are currently available in 25 European countries. In September 2019, Cdiscount announced an
acceleration of its international strategy through its alliance with three European marketplaces: real.de in
Germany, ePrice in Italy and eMag in Romania. This alliance, International Marketplace Network, or IMN, which
was implemented in October 2019, will allow marketplace vendors of these websites to easily and automatically
broadcast and sell their products on all four websites.

**Our Store Network**

We lease the majority of our properties. As of June 30, 2019, 11,815 stores in France, the Indian Ocean and Latin
America were in our network. A breakdown of the number of stores in our network by banner and geography as
of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and June 30, 2019 and retail space by banner and geography as of December
31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 is presented below.

**Management of Real Estate Portfolio**

We actively manage our property assets in France in line with our debt reduction plan and our transformation
toward a less capital-intensive model. As of December 31, 2018, the market value of the Group’s owned real
estate portfolio in France was estimated to be approximately €2.6 billion, including transfer duties (and excluding
our share of property held by Mercialys), compared with €3.9 billion at the end of 2017, mainly due to disposals
of real estate assets in the amount of €1.1 billion, including transfer duties, as well as various effects for €0.2
billion (for example, the annual review of rates of rental yield and market rental values, taking into account trends
in the commercial real estate market, acquisitions and revaluations of property).

Our integrated internal teams create value for our Group as well as for third parties that own the real estate assets
where we operate our retail stores through research and design, strategic land purchases, delegated project
management, property development and management, property letting, management of related legal affairs and
asset value enhancement and management.

To address changing consumer habits, we have adapted our hypermarket model by reducing selling areas and the
percentage of non-food product offerings and by optimizing other spaces, particularly stock rooms. This optimized
space presents an opportunity to increase the size and appeal of shopping malls by hosting specialist mid-sized
retailers. In 2018, we executed our strategy of reducing retail space devoted to non-food items in our hypermarkets
and creating additional shopping mall space through (i) the delivery of three hypermarket transformation projects
in Annecy, Besançon and Angers La Roseraie which created 4,000 square meters of shopping mall space, (ii) the
sale of two Géant hypermarket projects in Saint-Nazaire and Montpellier Argelliers in furtherance of the plan to
reduce the retail space of the Géant outlet to create medium-sized areas covering 3,500 square meters of GLA and
(iii) the opening of the first phase of the planned extension of the Port Sacré-Coeur site in Réunion, with a shopping
mall development covering 8,300 square meters of GLA.

**Valuation of IGC’s Real Estate Portfolio**

Certain independent property valuation specialists have carried out a valuation of a large part of IGC’s real estate
assets on an individual property basis as of December 31, 2018, from which all figures in the section “Summary—
_IGC—Overview of Real Estate Assets” are derived. The valuations were prepared on the basis of certain_
qualifications and assumptions, estimates and projections.

In particular, the valuation process did not include a review of all of IGC’s properties or lease agreements and is
thus based on a sample of physical visits over the last three years. The valuation process included a review of
high-level information provided by management, including the possibility to obtain specific building permits, the
properties’ financial performance, property refurbishment and expansionary capital expenditures, material
structural issues and summary lease information. Valuation specialists based their valuation on the assumption
that IGC and its subsidiaries held good title to the properties and that lease terms did not contain restrictive or
unusual terms or any unusual, tax, environment, planning or other restrictions associates therewith.

The valuations are based on the projected mature trading potential of our properties, including assumptions
regarding rental revenues, capital expenditure levels based on our historical and budgeted expenditure levels, or
alternative use value for a limited number of obsolete facilities that we have closed and expect to sell. Most
valuations also took into account the market liquidity of the property, along with market comparables. The thirdparty valuations also did not consider any potential environmental contamination, lead, radon, infestation or other
pollutants or hazardous materials at the properties, which would have a negative impact on any valuations. In
addition, as the valuation process was conducted on an individual property basis, central costs were not considered.
Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our property portfolio. Moreover, the third party valuation and

176


-----

update included herein could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the actual sale of our property
portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Accordingly, the valuation and update should not be
considered as a guarantee of present or future value.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We cannot assure you that the projections or
_assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third party valuation of IGC’s portfolio of real_
_estate assets are correct, accurate or complete”._

**Suppliers & Logistics**

We have a large network of suppliers and we believe that we provide an important channel for these suppliers to
access customers. In 2018, our top 10 suppliers represented 10.4% of our cost of goods sold. We work with over
60,000 suppliers who supply us with both private-label and national brand products. Our supplier base is
characterized by numerous stable, long-term relationships with suppliers from a wide variety of backgrounds,
including suppliers of leading or national brands, suppliers of our private-label products, small-to-medium
enterprises or cooperatives and farmers who supply our stores locally and suppliers of goods and services for
general and administrative purposes. Typically, supplier contracts are renewed on a yearly basis. We select our
suppliers based on strict specifications related to product quality. We do not believe that we are dependent on any
one supplier or that the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business.

We actively seek to maintain regular and constructive dialogue with our suppliers and have won awards for our
supplier collaborations, including three Grés d’Or prizes rewarding our relations with small-to-medium
enterprises in France.

To limit the social and environmental impact of our purchases, we have circulated the Supplier Ethics Charter
since 2011. This Charter specifies our expectations regarding freedom of association, which must be respected
across the supply chain, by reaffirming our commitment to banning all illegal practices in business relations and
requiring compliance with applicable laws and standards; upholding human rights and ensuring occupational
health and safety; and taking constant care to protect the environment through the efficient use of natural resources
and diligent waste management and pollution abatement. In 2014, we signed an initial Corporate Social
Responsibility agreement which affirmed the importance of encouraging suppliers to address CSR issues in their
own supply chain and to promote their responsible products; the need to continue training buyers in the standards
defined in the Supplier Ethics Charter and to take working conditions and environmental criteria into account
when selecting suppliers; and the importance of auditing supplier production facilities in countries deemed at risk
and assisting them, to the extent possible or necessary, in deploying corrective action plans.

Our supply chains are organized at the country level and differ banner by banner. For example, in France, for our
retail operations, our specialized subsidiary, Easydis, makes deliveries from 16 sites throughout the country
representing approximately 740,000 square meters of warehousing. We also outsource certain of our logistics
needs, such as transport and courier services, and enter into logistics partnerships designed to reduce supply chain
costs. Our supply chain management information system, from our suppliers to our retail stores, is covered by an
integrated information system. We use specific software to analyze the information we gather from our
distribution network. We believe that the strength and quality of our logistics network is critical to the freshness
of our products, quality control and customer satisfaction. We aim to optimize our logistics systems through
automation, robotization, pooling of warehouses and partnerships with last mile delivery experts. We seek to
reduce the environmental footprint of our supply chain by using alternative modes of transport.

Logistics is particularly crucial to the success of our e-commerce business. Cdiscount has a network of 10
distribution centers in France with a combined total of 523,000 square meters spread across three main regions:
Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux. To support its growing product assortment, a new warehouse of 80,000 square meters
was opened near Paris (Moissy) in June 2018 and a new warehouse of 60,000 square meters was opened near
Lyon in Andrézieux, France in July 2019. To efficiently process the large number of orders received, Cdiscount
has automated and custom-designed its warehouse space, using 3D packing machines which allow the creation of
customized packaging for each order, generating cost savings, and reducing cardboard usage with up to 30% less
wasted space, and installing automated sorting systems to increase the speed of order processing.

In Brazil, GPA operates 22 distribution centers and depots strategically located across the country, with a total
storage capacity of 650,000 square meters as of June 30, 2019. The locations of the distribution centers enable
GPA to make frequent shipments to retail stores, which reduces the need for large in-store inventory spaces, and
limits non-productive store inventories. GPA uses pd@net, a business-to-business technology platform, which
links GPA’s computer-automated system to distribution centers and suppliers in order to automatically replenish
retail store inventory.

**Quality Control**

Product quality and safety are our top priorities. We have developed an end-to-end system from product
specifications to store operations that ensures we sell safe, healthy products of the highest quality. Our
international quality control system is deployed through a number of different channels, including through our
centralized internal Group Quality department that is fully dedicated to monitoring and enforcing quality
assurance and food safety standards and procedures, and managing any quality or food safety issue across our
entire supply chain. The Group Quality department coordinates with subsidiary quality departments to share best
practices and procedures in such areas as product quality and safety policies, traceability, supplier audits, crisis
management and product withdrawal and recall. We perform regular on-side audits of production facilities, with
emphasis of health and safety risks in compliance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point principles. In
particular, our audits focus on the inspection of suppliers of private-label food products, our own warehouses to
verify that best practice procedures and guidelines are being followed and our retail store locations in France.

In addition, we conduct various product quality controls throughout the year, including several inspections of our
private-label products by independent laboratories, microbiology analyses by our banners’ quality departments to
manage any potentially serious health risks, sensory analyses conducted with customers to monitor taste, aroma
and sensory characteristics of our products, and grading of produce and butcher meats in warehouses through
approximately 320,000 annual inspections.

Our French and Latin American operations are members of initiatives which set global benchmarks for food safety
standards throughout the supply chain. For example, in 2018, we conducted a total of 33,994 microbiology tests
in France to control food, household and health and beauty products.

We sell high quality private-label food products and work to ensure the quality and safety of our products across
every private-label product range. To that end, we have defined strict contractually binding specifications for
every sourced private-label product which ensure that the supplier delivers a product that complies both with
applicable legislation and the quality grade expected by the banners. These specifications consist of descriptive
technical data, compliance statements and analysis reports.

In addition to the foregoing systems that are deployed on an international level, our individual subsidiaries also
develop and deploy their own quality control and product safety programs.

**Information Systems**

Our information systems are critical to our business operations. They provide management, analytical and
performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake business processes. Our technical
infrastructure and computer applications are also used for the day-to-day management of our business, including
purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, loyalty program management, data exploitation, invoicing, cash
collection, reporting, consolidation and electronic data interchange. Our business depends on the ability of our
employees to process transactions on secure information systems and our capacity to store, retrieve, process and
manage information.

Our information systems are highly integrated, covering most of our fundamental business service areas. We have
developed a target model based primarily on two well-known management software suites for administrative
functions and sales functions. This model encompasses IT standards and governance frameworks to ensure that
our information systems are geared to our current and future objectives.

We have a dedicated department, the Group Information Systems Security Department, that ensures the security
of our information systems by regularly assessing each unit’s information systems security, ensuring that action
plans have been drawn up to address areas for improvement and leveraging synergies between information
systems security departments to coordinate initiatives and ensure a consistent level of security across our lines of
business.

We believe that our information systems are robust, adequate to support our activities and operate at standards
that are comparable to other operators in our industry.

**Customers, Publicity and Marketing**

We seek to promote quality dialogue with our customers to stay in tune with customers’ expectations and to
promote customer service. Each of our banners has an organization dedicated to customer service functions.

Our main banners have established loyalty programs (including digital programs) to improve customer
satisfaction, monitor customer needs and allow customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future
purchases. Our loyalty programs are a key tool in giving loyal customers access to preferential offers tailored to

178


-----

their shopping habits. For example, the Éxito loyalty program had 5 million members as of December 31, 2018
and is Colombia’s largest. Furthermore, Cdiscount’s à Volonté loyalty program had over two million members to
date and provided its member customers free one-day shipping and other advantages such as free and unlimited
online access to 200 newspapers and magazines.

Each of our banners has a customer service center that is open 24/7 by telephone, mail or the Internet where
customers can obtain information on stores and products and have their questions answered. We also connect with
our customers through dedicated applications, as well as our banners’ social networks, which allow customers to
exchange directly with our stores and have their questions answered in real time, and through surveys and
questionnaires that address a wide variety of issues that affect customer satisfaction, from store cleanliness and
service quality to the range of products offered.

Marketing is an integral part of the promotion of our banners, stores and products. We carry out a number of
branding and advertising initiatives through our stores, websites and mobile applications, and, to a lesser extent,
through print and broadcast advertising campaigns. We develop integrated marketing campaigns specific to each
store banner in which we operate that are structured and directed to the banner’s target consumer market. The
Group is engaged in customizing its marketing efforts through the development of mobile applications like Casino
Max in France or Meu Desconto in Brazil, which enables customers to access customized coupons.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 220,060 employees, including those individuals employed by GPA
and Grupo Éxito, of which 214,458 were full-time equivalent employees. Of our full-time equivalent employees,
11,624 were managers, 22,099 were supervisors and 180,735 were supporting staff. Typically, the total number
of employees increases at the end of the year due to seasonal hires. A majority of these employees, 68%, are based
in South America, while the remaining 32% of the employees are based in France.

A breakdown of the employee workforce by country as of December 31, 2018 is set forth below:

**As of December 31, 2018**

France ............................................................................................... 32%

Brazil ................................................................................................ 46%

Colombia .......................................................................................... 17%

Argentina & Uruguay ...................................................................... 5%

As of December 31, 2018, 94% of these employees were employed under permanent contracts. Fixed-term
contracts are used primarily to replace staff on leave or to support in-store teams during peak season periods.
Trends in our business resulted in the hiring of more than 115,650 people on permanent or fixed-term contracts
in 2018, which reflects an increase of 6% over the prior year. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 83% of
the total employees were employed full-time. Our turnover rate was 25.8% in 2018.

Our compensation policy takes into account each employee’s skills, level of responsibility and experience. We
are committed to offering at least the legal minimum wage with fair, competitive compensation in line with market
practices observed for each job and tailored to the specific local characteristics of each host country. We also offer
variable compensation to most managers, supervisors and employees to encourage individual and group
performance based on the fulfilment of quantitative and qualitative objectives. We regularly carry out surveys,
mainly concerning management positions and other jobs that are difficult to fill, in order to assess the
competitiveness of our compensation as compared with our peers.

Every unit across our business in France has signed collective bargaining agreements with representative unions,
covering issues such as working hours and compensation. We maintain regular dialogue with trade unions. There
are currently more than 10 agreements and action plans in force, the implementation of which is regularly
monitored and presented to the representative trade unions annually. We believe we have good working
relationships with our employees and their representatives and have not experienced any significant labor disputes
or work stoppages.

In each of the countries in which we operate, we have developed and implemented innovative human resources
and management policies that are sensitive to local cultures. These policies are designed to foster the professional
development of employees, enhance employee talents, combat discrimination, support equal opportunity, nurture
constructive and innovative social dialogue, promote employee health, safety and well-being in the workplace and
offer fair, progressive compensation and benefits. We are committed to promoting diversity in our hiring practices,
helping young people enter the workforce, providing growth opportunities for employees and taking action to
protect employees’ health and well-being.

179


-----

We are committed to providing career growth opportunities to our employees, who are the driving force behind
our operating performance. We prioritize internal mobility in order to facilitate employee career development and
ensure that we have adequate resources to meet our current and future needs. For example, we are committed to
filling at least 50% of our management positions by promoting from within. We believe that our training
capabilities are a powerful driver of employability and upward social mobility. Each of our subsidiaries’ human
resources departments offers training plans to support our employees’ growth and career development and to
guarantee the smooth integration of new hires. In every unit, training focuses on four main subjects: (1) health,
safety and quality rules and practices; (2) technical training in our business; (3) training in customer service; and
(4) management and leadership training. Our training is delivered by dedicated teams, such as Campus Casino,
Assaí University or Leader Price University, and through our in-house training centers, which offer a diversified
range of classroom and online programs to address the development of skills needed by the retail trade, the
acquisition of technical capabilities and management practices.

**Intellectual Property**

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks in our business and rely on trademark and copyright
laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. We
believe that the brand names of each of our various banners enjoy high brand recognition in their respective
geographic markets and are material to our business. Our intellectual property policy is centered around the
protection of our brands and our domain names. This policy involves filings and reservations on either a local
country basis or in the full range of countries where we operate or wish to preserve and protect our rights.

Our principal trade names (that we own, or, in the case of Spar, which we license) include: Casino, Casino
Supermarché, Cdiscount, Franprix, Géant, Géant Casino, GreenYellow, Le Marché Franprix, Le Petit Casino,
Leader Price, Monop, Monop’, Monoprix, Naturalia, Petit Casino, Spar, Vival and Vival by Casino.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance coverage against the risks inherent in our various businesses. Our insurance policies cover
combined property damage and business interruption coverage, civil liability coverage, environmental liability
coverage, cybercrime coverage, transported goods insurance, corporate officers’ liability insurance, building
manager and/or property portfolio manager professional liability coverage, fleet insurance, construction liability
coverage and health and death or disability insurance in France. When allowed by law, we pursue our policy of
purchasing worldwide master insurance policies in order to improve and increase the levels of cover where we
believe necessary. In addition, to manage and control our insurance costs, we self-insure small, high-frequency
claims corresponding mainly to civil liability and property damage claims. We consider our policies adequate to
cover the major risks of our business, but there can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover
the cost of defense or damages in the event of a significant claim. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Business and Industry—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to_
_significant financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate”._

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, we may be party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the normal
operations of our business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers and customers and disputes with
our lessors at the renewal of our commercial leases. A description of material legal proceedings and investigations
to which we are party is below.

**_Arbitration between GPA and Peninsula_**

On September 12, 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro Península
(“Península”) in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related to leasing
agreements concerning stores owned by Península and operated by GPA. The leases in question have a duration
of 20 years as from 2005 and are renewable for another 20-year period at the sole discretion of GPA and set out
the method for calculating rental charges. Despite the discussions concerning application of the lease terms, the
request for arbitration has no impact on the operation of the leased stores, which is contractually guaranteed. The
arbitration is ongoing. As of June 30, 2019, GPA had not set aside any provision in relation to this arbitration.

**_DGCCRF proceedings_**

On February 28, 2017, the French Ministry of the Economy, represented by the Department of Competition Policy,
Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (the “DGCCRF”), brought an action against Casino in the Paris Commercial
Court concerning a series of credits totaling €22.2 million issued in 2013 and 2014 granted to our Group by 41
suppliers. The DGCCRF claims that we demanded that these credits be given to us in an illicit manner outside the

180


-----

scope of our annual supply contracts and conditioned our future business relations on the grant of such credits.
The DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned and the imposition of a fine of €2
million.

Additionally, on April 11, 2017, the DGCCRF also brought an action in the Paris Commercial Court against the
common purchasing entity Intermarché-Casino Achats (“INCA-A”), and its parent companies Intermarché and
Casino, claiming that INCA-A had engaged in abusive commercial practices and benefited from an economic
imbalance when we were engaged in supply negotiations with 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and
fragrance industry in 2015. The DGCCRF is seeking restitution of sums to the suppliers in question and the
imposition of a fine of €2 million.

Proceedings related to both cases are still in progress. We believe that we complied with applicable law and
regulations during our negotiations with our suppliers and intend to continue to vigorously defend our position.
As of June 30, 2019, we had not set aside any provision in relation to these matters.

**_Investigations by French and European Competition Authorities_**

We have been subject to inquiries by the French and European competition authorities concerning certain of our
business practices.

In February 2017, representatives of the French Competition Authority carried out a search of the premises of
Vindémia Logistique and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply
and distribution activities in Réunion. At this stage, the French Competition Authority has not issued any
complaint in connection with these searches and our appeal contesting the legitimacy of the searches is still
pending.

Additionally, in February 2017, representatives of the European Commission carried out a search of the premises
of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon Achats Marchandises Casino (“AMC”) and INCA-A, in connection with an
investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services to manufacturers
of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers. In May 2019,
representatives of the European Commission conducted additional searches of the premises of AMC, INCA-A
having since ceased operations. Although the European Commission has not yet issued any complaint in
connection with the abovementioned searches, the European Commission publicly announced on November 4,
2019 that it had launched an official investigation to assess whether we and Intermarché have coordinated our
conduct in the market in breach of EU competition rules. Applications filed by our Group to contest the legitimacy
of the European Commission’s first series of searches are still pending before the General Court of the European
Union and we also intend to contest the legitimacy of the second series of searches before the same court.

Moreover, in July 2018, after receiving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015,
the French Competition Authority launched an informal investigation into the creation of joint purchasing
organizations in the food retailing sector. The investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing
organization set up between Auchan, Casino, Metro, Schiever and Dia. The investigation is still in progress.

**REGULATION**

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and industry standards administered by local, national and_
_other government entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The following provides a brief description of_
_the main laws and regulations that govern our activities and personnel in our principal geographic markets,_
_France, Brazil and Colombia. References and discussions to directives, laws, regulations and other administrative_
_and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such directives, laws, regulations and other_
_administrative and regulatory documents themselves._

**Food Safety and Hygiene**

As a major international food retailer, we are subject to food safety and hygiene regulations and directives
promulgated by the jurisdictions in which we operate.

**_European Union_**

The main food safety regulator at the EU level is the European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”), which was
established in 2002 by Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002, as amended and supplemented (the “General Food Law
**Regulation”). The EFSA assesses and communicates risks associated with the food chain in order to inform the**
policies and decisions of food safety risk managers.

The General Food Law Regulation sets forth the general principles and requirements of food safety legislation to
be implemented into national law by all member states of the EU. In particular, the General Food Law Regulation
requires food business operators to ensure that businesses under their control satisfy relevant requirements and to
verify that such requirements are met at all stages of production, processing and distribution. It also imposes a
mandatory traceability requirement along the entire food chain that applies to all food and all types of operators
in the processing, transportation, storage, distribution and retail stages, among others. Each food operator is
required to register and keep for a reasonable period of time (the guidance of the Standing Committee (on the
Food Chain and Animal Health) states that five years is a reasonable time) detailed product information (including
the name and address of the producer, the nature of the product and the transaction date) and make such records
immediately available to competent authorities upon request.

Our food products sold in our French retail locations are also subject to specific European food hygiene legislation
under Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 of April 29, 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, which applies to all food
businesses, and to Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of April 29, 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the
hygiene of foodstuffs of animal origin (together, the “EU Hygiene Regulations”). The EU Hygiene Regulations
require that we obtain and maintain hazard analysis and critical control point (“HACCP”) certification, including
instructing employees in this regard and conducting appropriate record-keeping. HACCP is a systematic
preventive approach used in the food industry to identify potential food safety hazards, so that key actions (known
as critical control points) may be taken to reduce or eliminate risks, while considering all key aspects of product
manufacturing, from the safety of the raw materials, to process validation (for example, cooking and washing), to
shelf life and finally end-consumer usage. In addition, the EU Hygiene Regulations include more stringent
requirements for food products of animal origin, such as meat, fish and dairy products, and food containing such
products. European legislation regulates the temperature settings at which these products must be kept as well as
the length of time for which they can be displayed.

In addition, our French operations are subject to European legislation governing the production, transport and
storage of frozen foods intended for human consumption. Council Directive (EEC) No. 89/108 of December 21,
1988 (amended, inter alia, by European Directive 2006/107/EC dated November 20, 2006), establishes the general
European regulatory framework for the trade and manufacture of frozen foods. European Directive 92/2/EEC
dated January 13, 1992 and Regulation No. 37/2005 dated January 12, 2005 set out specific technical measures
for the implementation of the framework established by Directive 89/108/EEC. Directive 92/2/EEC establishes
the sampling procedures and the European Union’s method of analysis for the official control of such samples.
Regulation (EC) No. 37/2005 dated January 12, 2005 also details the monitoring of temperatures during the
transport, warehousing and storage of frozen foods.

**_France_**

In France, the principal food safety regulator is the Agency for Food, Environment and Occupational Health and
Safety (Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail, or the
“ANSES”). The ANSES is the independent expert within the French administration for public health safety
matters. The ANSES may make any recommendation to the French authorities in this respect. In addition, French
food safety regulation requires each establishment that brings to market products of animal origin or food
containing such products to obtain an official authorization. Further, we are subject to several provisions of the

182


-----

French Rural Code (Code rural), as amended, dealing with, among other things, with food safety epidemiology
concerns related to products of animal origin and animal feed, and animal health.

**_Brazil_**

In Brazil, the safety of the food supply is governed by a number of regulatory agencies. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (“MAPA”) and the Ministry of Health (“MS”), through its National
Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (“ANVISA”), are the primary regulators of agricultural products. MAPA
enforces a large number of regulations pertaining to the production, marketing, import and export of animal
products, fresh fruits and vegetables, alcoholic beverages, juices, grains, seeds and animal feed (including food
for pets). ANVISA enforces most of the regulations governing processed food products. The Brazilian Consumer
Protection Code (Law n° 8,078/90) (“CDC”) also treats consumer health and safety protection.

**Food Labelling and Nutrition**

In addition to the hygiene and safety of our food products, we are also subject to regulations and directives
governing food labelling and nutrition of the food products that we sell to customers.

**_European Union_**

Our food products sold in our French retail locations are subject to Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of October
25, 2011 on the provision of information to consumers (the “Food Labelling Regulation”), which replaced and
consolidated into one piece of legislation previous labelling rules deriving from Directive 2000/13/EC regarding
labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling of foodstuffs,
and other legislative acts for specific categories of foods. The Food Labelling Regulation, which introduced key
changes such as mandatory nutrition disclosure on processed foods and amendments to nutrition labelling formats,
entered into force on December 13, 2014 (save for the obligation to provide nutrition information applicable from
December 13, 2016). Additional provisions regarding allergen labelling in hot beverages also apply. In recent
years, national and local authorities have begun introducing regulations and requirements motivated by concerns
regarding nutrition and environmental sustainability. These measures have included, among others, greater
emphasis on food labelling and disclosure of nutritional content, requirements to utilize recyclable packaging
materials, and additional taxes on food and beverage items with high sugar content.

**_Brazil_**

Since 2011, Brazilian law has required the use of labels containing nutrition facts on most food products, with
some categories of products exempt from these regulations. Pursuant to the CDC, product labels are required to
include the product’s quantity, composition, price, guarantee, shelf life, origin and a description of any risks to
the consumer’s health and safety. All imported products are required to present food labels in Portuguese and
reflect metric units or a metric equivalent. ANVISA is responsible for the development and enforcement of food
labelling regulations, including by providing specific guidelines for food labelling content.

**_Colombia_**

In Colombia, food product labelling is mandated by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (“MHSP”),
which establishes standards for labelling of packaged and raw food products for human consumption. Through
Resolution 5109 of December 29, 2005, MHSP regulation mandates that labels relating to packaged food products
and raw materials for food for human consumption must provide clear and comprehensive information with the
goal of allowing consumers to make informed choices about the products they purchase. Such information must
be provided in Spanish.

**Consumer Protection**

**_France_**

The marketing and sale of our products to consumers subject us to various consumer protection laws and
regulations. In France, this requirement arises under, in particular, the French Consumer Protection Code (Code
_de la consommation) and also the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (loi n°2004-575 du 21 juin 2004 pour la_
_confiance en l’économie numérique) (“LCEN”), which defines e-commerce and sets out specific obligations_
applicable to online retailers. A department of the Ministry of Economy, the Department for Competition,
Consumer Protection, and Anti-Fraud Enforcement (Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation
_et de la Répression des Fraudes) is specifically responsible for protecting consumers and their safety. From time_
to time it conducts audits of the Group’s operations on-site and through document reviews. In addition, the
“Hamon Law” (loi n°2014-344 _du 17 mars 2014 relative à la consommation) that transposes into French law the_

183


-----

provisions of Directive 2011/83/EU of October 25, 2011 on consumer rights was implemented on March 17, 2014.
It introduced a number of changes related to the quality of pre-contractual information to be provided to
consumers, extended the cancellation period for distance contracts to fourteen days, introduced the possibility for
group actions, forbade additional payments as a default option and prohibited retailers from having loyalty card
offerings that are subject to payment on credit. Additional pre-contractual transparency obligations for certain
operators of online platforms were introduced by the Law for a Digital Republic (loi n°2016-1321 du 7 octobre
_2016 pour une République numérique), which became effective in 2018._

**_Brazil_**

In Brazil, the Procuradoria de Proteção e Defesa do Consumidor (“Procon”) offices serve as an important source
of guidance for consumers. Procon is responsible for guiding consumers with their grievances and providing them
with information about their rights. The first Procon office was established in São Paulo in 1970. Procon’s
presence has grown to now include an office in every Brazilian state capital. Brazil’s consumer defense policies
are regulated by the Consumer and Protection Defense Department (“DPDC”).

**_Colombia_**

Consumer protection in Colombia is governed the Consumer Protection Act (Law No. 1480 of 2011) and Article
78 of the Colombian constitution. The Superintendence of Industry and Commerce is the state agency responsible
for ensuring consumers’ rights. Through the authority granted by the Consumer Protection Act, the
Superintendence of Industry and Commerce is charged with protecting consumers from hazards to their health
and safety, ensuring the provision of adequate information to consumers so that they may make informed choices
and prioritizing the protection of children and adolescents as consumers, among other initiatives aimed at
protecting Colombian consumers.

**Consumer Credit**

**_France_**

Our Banque Casino operations in France, through which we offer various forms of consumer loans and consumer
credit, subject us to regulations that govern the French consumer credit regulatory framework. The EU Consumer
Credit Directive 2008/48/EC was adopted in April 2008 and has been implemented in France through a number
of consumer credit regulations. Certain obligations introduced by Law 2010-737, dated July 1, 2010 and the
Ordinance n° 2016-301 dated March 14, 2016 relating to the legislative part of the French consumer code ratified
by Law 2017-203 dated February 1, 2017, reforming consumer credit and lending, apply to regulate more strictly
the availability and use of consumer credit.

The law requires, inter alia, that, before making a loan, lenders must (i) verify the solvency of, and provide an
explanation and information to, borrowers, (ii) deliver a precontractual information sheet to the borrower, (iii)
consult the credit rating reports showing any incidents of failure to repay a debt and (iv) provide a legally mandated
withdrawal period (which is set by law at 14 days), during which the borrower may decide to cancel the loan
without cause and without penalty. Regulations also affect the maximum amounts that consumers can borrow and
maximum interest rates (usury rates). Furthermore, specific provisions apply to loans made at the point of sale:
the law provides for (i) an obligation to specifically train sellers in retail outlets in making consumer loans, (ii)
the regulation of commissions paid to sellers and (iii) an obligation on retailers to deliver a questionnaire and
information sheet to be completed by the seller and the borrower. For loans exceeding €3,000, the questionnaire
must be supplemented by supporting documents. Certain types of consumer loans, such as revolving credits or
specific purchase loans, are subject to additional requirements.

**_Brazil_**

Financial institutions in Brazil must seek authorization to operate from the Brazilian Central Bank, a supervisory
body that functions under the mandate of the National Monetary Council policy committee of Brazil, which is
composed of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Planning, Budget and Management and the Governor of the
Central Bank. The Central Bank is responsible for the surveillance of financial institutions, the implementation of
monetary and credit policies and the enforcement of regulations applicable to financial institutions in the public
and private sectors.

**_Colombia_**

The foundation of the regulatory framework for financial regulation in Colombia is Article 335 of the Colombian
constitution, which specifies that financial activities are of public interest and may only be undertaken with prior
and express government authorization. The Colombian Congress has the authority to legislate on matters relating

184


-----

to financial activities. Among such laws are Law No. 45 of 1990, which establishes the government’s power to
intervene, inspect, supervise and control the financial markets, as well as Law No. 1328 of 2009, which sets out
the general principles for financial consumer protection. In addition, the Ministry of Finance issues decrees setting
out policies for the financial sector and the Superintendence of Finance issues resolutions and letters that
implement and enforce banking regulations.

**Restrictions on Promotions of Food Items**

In France, our flexibility in pricing food items sold by our various banners is limited by the law of October 30,
2018, which is also known as the Égalim Law (the “Égalim Law”). The Égalim Law, as completed by the
provisions of a number of ordinances and decrees promulgated after its enactment, limits the ability of food
retailers to sell products to consumers at a loss. The Égalim Law also limits food retailers’ ability to carry out
promotional campaigns for food products for a trial period of two years, beginning on January 1, 2019, including
the following limits:

  - food rebates are capped at 34% of the value of the product, meaning that food retailers may no longer
offer two-for-one sales (although three-for-two sales are permitted);

  - promotions can only concern 25% of the annual merchandise volume sold by the banner; and

  - the use of the word “free” is prohibited for the promotion of a food product.

**Security Standards**

**_France_**

In France, certain of our premises may fall under the safety standards applicable to buildings open to the public
(établissements recevant du public), as set forth in Articles L. 123-1 to L. 123-4 and Articles R. 123-1 to R. 12356 of the French Construction and Housing Code (Code de la construction et de l’habitation). These provisions
include the safety rules for such buildings and, in particular, the protective measures required to minimize the risk
of fire and panic. Buildings open to the public include any building, premise or closed space where people are
admitted, either free of charge or in consideration of a fee or other payment, or where meetings are held that are
open to all, or upon invitation, whether for a fee or otherwise. Builders, owners and operators of buildings open
to the public are required, both during construction and operation, to comply with certain preventive and protective
measures to ensure safety, and must also ensure that the facilities and equipment are maintained and repaired in
accordance with applicable regulations.

A specific authorization is required for premises open to public, classified on a scale of 1 to 5 depending on how
many persons can simultaneously be in the premises at any given time. If a building is classified in categories 1
to 4, the relevant mayor must issue an order (arrêté) authorizing the opening of the premises after receiving a
positive assessment from the competent safety commission once he or she has carried out an inspection visit. The
safety commission will visit the building regularly to check its safety standards.

**_Brazil_**

In Brazil, businesses seeking to open and operate stores must obtain a business permit, health and safety permits,
site approval and an inspection certificate from the local fire department. Retail stores are subject to regular
inspection by city authorities.

**Data Privacy**

As part of our business operations, we process customer data for several purposes, including for marketing. Our
collection of such consumer data subjects us to regulations governing our practices of consumer data collection
and use.

**_European Union_**

In the European Union, we must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws that restrict our ability to
collect and use personal information relating to individuals, including customers and potential customers,
including the marketing use of that information. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, which
became applicable on May 25, 2018 (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”), increased both the
number of and the restrictive nature of obligations for the collection and processing of personal data. The GDPR’s
range of compliance obligations carry financial risks resulting from penalties for data breach or improper
processing of personal data, including a possible fine of up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the

185


-----

preceding financial year for the most serious infringements. The territorial scope of the GDPR now extends to
entities outside the EU that target or sell to individuals in the EU.

**_France_**

In France, we are subject to Law No. 78-17, dated January 6, 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and
Civil Liberties, as amended on June 21, 2018, for our collection and processing of personal data, including
customer data (the “LIL”) and the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (Code de postes et de
_communications électroniques (the “CPCE”)_

The LIL sets out the national derogations from the GDPR, defines individuals’ rights to their personal information
and gives the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, or
“CNIL”) notably the power to intervene on their behalf. It also covers other matters not addressed by the GDPR,
such as implementation of EU Law Enforcement Directive (EU 2016/680). The CNIL has a wide range of powers,
including the power to temporarily or permanently suspend data processing operations, order the deletion of data,
conduct investigations and spot audits and/or request a competent court to order the adoption of any necessary
measures. The CNIL can issue the sanctions permitted by the GDPR and additional fines for non-compliance and
it may also order the publication of its enforcement actions. Criminal sanctions can also apply for non-compliance
with the LIL under the French Criminal Code.

The CPCE (as amended by the LCEN) implements certain obligations of the EU Directive on privacy and
electronic communications (2002/58/EC), as amended (the “ePrivacy Directive”), including rules relating to direct
marketing by electronic means (e.g., email, SMS, online messaging), which are of particular relevance to the
marketing activities of the Group. The ePrivacy Directive will be replaced by EU regulation some time in 2020,
and like the GDPR it will be directly applicable within the Member States. The final text of the regulation has not
been agreed, therefore there is uncertainty regarding the ultimate scope of the regulation and whether it will
maintain existing rules regarding electronic marketing or whether such activities will be subject to additional
compliance obligations. Sanctions for breach of the new regulation will be equivalent to those contained in the
GDPR.

**_Brazil_**

Brazil’s data privacy regulations include the recently-enacted General Data Protection Law (Law No. 13.709/218) (“LGPD”), which is based on the GDPR governing the EU. The LGPD was enacted on August 14, 2018 and
will apply as of August 16, 2020 (per Provisional Measure 869 of December 27, 2018). It is intended to prevent
abuse in the processing and use of personal data. Subject to a few exceptions, the LGPD applies to activities,
whether by individuals or public and private entities, involving information pertaining to an identified or
identifiable person. The Brazilian Data Protection Authority is expected to issue further information regarding the
specific requirements of the LGPD in the near future. Failure to comply with the regulations set forth therein may
subject the infringing party to civil liability, administrative sanctions and public acknowledgment of noncompliance.

In addition to the LGPD, data protection in Brazil is governed by the Civil Code, the CDC, Law No. 12,414/2011
(regulating credit information relating to individuals and legal entities), the Internet Civil Framework (Law No.
12,965/2014, (providing for the protection of internet users’ privacy) and Decree 8,771/2016 (governing data
protection by application providers).

**_Colombia_**

In Colombia, the processing of personal data is regulated by two principal laws as well as several decrees that set
out data protection obligations. Statutory Law No. 1266 of 2008 regulates the processing of financial data, credit
records and commercial information collected in Colombia or abroad. It also defines general terms on habeas data,
a legal remedy for the violation of individual’s right to privacy due to the gathering, collecting or storing of data
regarding the individual, and establishes basic data processing principles, data subject rights, data controller
obligations and specific rules for financial data. It further requires those who process and control personal data to
guarantee that such data is maintained pursuant to strict security measures and confidentiality standards, will not
be modified or disclosed absent prior data subject consent and will only be used for purposes identified in a privacy
policy or notice.

In addition, Statutory Law 1581 of 2012 regulates personal data processing, as well as databases, by defining
special categories of personal data, including sensitive data and data collected from minors. The law further
regulates data processing authorization and procedures and creates the National Register of Data Bases. Subject
to certain exceptions, it is applicable to all data collection and processing in Colombia.

**Online Communications and Website Hosting Services**

**_France_**

The LCEN sets out rules for the liability of Internet service providers, hosting service providers and caching
providers, which include website editors, e-merchants and website hosting companies, including those conducting
e-commerce. The LCEN makes direct or indirect identification compulsory for publishers of online
communications services and distinguishes between editors of online communication services and website hosting
service providers. Under the LCEN, editors of online communication services are required to provide certain
identification information and are subject to a general obligation to monitor the information made publicly
available through their websites. Editors may be held liable for the content of such information, or in certain cases,
for example, “diffamation”, may be subject to criminal sanctions.

Under sections 6 I 2 and 6 I 7 of the LCEN, website hosting service providers have neither a general obligation to
monitor the information that they transmit or store, nor a general obligation to actively seek facts or circumstances
indicating illegal activities. The LCEN clearly provides that website hosting service providers cannot be held
civilly liable for illicit content stored, absent actual knowledge of the illicit nature of such content or of facts or
circumstances evidencing illegality and if they have promptly withdrawn evident illicit content as from they have
been duly notified by any entitled third party. To this end, website service providers shall maintain a passive role
in regard to the stored content. In particular, verification of the content posted on the website (including comments
or advertisements) shall be purely automatic and technical.

However, despite this limited liability, website hosting services remain subject to several obligations, including
assistance in preventing the spread of certain offences by implementing a reporting mechanism, assistance in
removing illegal content once informed of its illegality and a targeted and temporary monitoring obligation when
requested by a judicial authority.

**_Brazil_**

The CDC, through Law No. 8,078/90, establishes specific rules applicable to electronic commerce in Brazil.
Pursuant to this law, e-commerce retailers are required to present the following information on their websites:
their names, taxpayer registration numbers, physical and electronic addresses and essential information about the
products or services they offer. In addition, e-commerce providers are subject to additional requirements, such as
to maintain an adequate and effective service for addressing consumer demands (including specified time limits
within which such demands must be addressed), to promptly confirm receipt of the order upon the sale of products
and to ensure proper channels for product returns.

**French Commercial Lease Law**

**_General_**

Commercial leases are regulated by Decree No. 59-960 of September 30, 1953 (“Decree 53-960”), codified in
part in Articles L. 145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. The aforementioned commercial leases regulation
automatically applies to leases of (i) buildings or premises, (ii) when the lease is granted for commercial, industrial
or handcraft activity, (iii) when the lessee is running its business (fonds de commerce) from the premises
(irrespective of whether this business is run by a merchant or a manufacturer) and (iv) when the lessee is registered
with the French trade and companies registry or with the craft directory.

Most of our stores and warehouses are leased under commercial lease agreements subject to Articles L. 145-1 et
_seq., R. 145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the non-codified part of Decree 53-960, which give the_
lessee certain rights (particularly the right to renew a lease agreement or receive compensation should the lessor
refuse to renew the lease).

**_Terms of Commercial Leases_**

Pursuant to Article L. 145-4 of the French Commercial Code, the minimum term of a commercial lease is nine
years. This provision of the French Commercial Code is a matter of public policy, and therefore any contractual
provision providing its exclusion is void. Parties can also provide for a longer term, but commercial leases rarely
exceed twelve years because in such case, they must be drafted in the form of a notarial deed and must be registered
(at some cost) with the French land registry.

The lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease every three years, although this right can be waived by
an agreement between the parties in certain limited cases (for example, if the duration of the lease agreement is
longer than twelve years or if the lease concerns premises used exclusively for office purposes, premises only

187


-----

used for a specific activity or premises used for storage activity). The lessor may only terminate the lease at the
end of each three-year period in very limited circumstances, notably if it intends to build, rebuild or raise the
height of the existing premises.

At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to have the lease renewed. Pursuant to Article
L. 145-8 of the French Commercial Code, the right of renewal is granted to a lessee who owns a business provided
that the lessee has effectively carried on the same business in the leased premises during the three years preceding
the expiry of the lease, and provided that the lessee’s right has been registered with the French trade and companies
registry.

If the lessor refuses to renew the lease, the lessee is entitled to receive compensation for eviction corresponding
to the loss it suffers unless the lessor can show serious and legitimate cause (un motif sérieux et légitime) (usually
the lessee’s serious and repeated non-compliance with the terms of the lease agreement). This compensation must
correspond to the harm suffered by the lessee due to the non-renewal of the lease agreement and includes all losses
suffered and expenses incurred as a result of the loss of the premises. If the non-renewal of the lease results in the
loss of clientele and thus of the lessee’s business, the amount of the compensation is then assessed according to
the open market value of the lessee’s business or the value of the right of use.

Upon the expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take no action to renew or terminate the lease,
the original lease is automatically extended. However, a tacitly extended lease may be terminated at any time by
either the lessee or the lessor upon six months prior notice for an effective termination on the last day of a calendar
quarter.

**_Rent and Rent Revision_**

The parties are free to set the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the property. The rent
may be fixed, variable or composed of a fixed portion (e.g., a guaranteed minimum) and a variable portion (e.g.,
determined by reference to a certain percentage of turnover at the leased premises). Generally, an annual rent
indexation clause is provided for in the lease.

Furthermore, commercial lease regulation provides for the possibility of a judicial rent review (a public order
regulation, which cannot be carved out) every three years as from the date on which the amount of the rent had
been previously agreed or determined by a judge, so as to correspond to the rental value, but without exceeding
the variation in the ILC (Indice des loyers commerciaux, or commercial rent index), in the case of leases used in
commercial or artisanal activities, or the ILAT (Indice des loyers des activités tertiaires, or the service industries
rent index), in the case of leases for other activities, published since the last rent review, unless a material change
in local economic factors has modified the rental value of the leased premises by more than 10%. Moreover, if
the lease provides for annual rent indexation, the rent may be subject to review by a judge if it increases or
decreases by more than 25% compared to the amount previously agreed to by the parties or determined by the
court, by reason of such indexation. Either party can apply to the court to assess the reviewed rent if the parties
fail to agree on it.

**_Rent of Renewed Leases_**

According to Article L. 145-33 of the French Commercial Code, the renewed rent shall, in principle, correspond
to the market value determined by the court, taking into account the nature and the possible uses of the premises,
the parties’ obligations under the lease and commercial factors such as location, neighboring businesses, proximity
to transport routes and comparable local rents.

However, pursuant to Article L. 145-34 of the French Commercial Code, the increase in rent upon renewal of the
lease may be limited, depending upon the activity carried out in the rented premises and the duration of the lease.
In such case, the renewed rent cannot be higher than the original rent, as adjusted according to the variation of the
ILC (or, as the case may be, the ILAT) since the date on which the rent in the original lease was set. This cap will
not apply if there have been significant changes to the parties’ obligations or the nature, use or environment of the
premises in the interim. The cap will also not apply to: (i) leases for office use only, (ii) leases of premises built
for a specific single purpose (for example, those built or altered for a specialized purpose rendering them
unsuitable for another use without alteration), (iii) leases of an initial term exceeding nine years, (iv) leases of an
initial term of nine years but which, due to automatic extension, have an effective term exceeding a twelve-year
duration and (v) unless the parties have agreed otherwise, leases that provide that the rent is variable or is
comprised of a fixed portion and a variable portion. Since June 20, 2014 and according to Article L. 145-34 of the
French Commercial Code, the resulting variation in the rent may not lead to an increase, in any given year, of
more than 10% of the rent paid over the past year.

188


-----

In the absence of any agreement between the parties on the amount of the renewed rent, and except for leases
providing for a variable rent, the new rent of the renewed lease will be determined by a competent court by
applying Articles L. 145-33 et seq. and R. 145-2 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.

**_Subleases_**

Article L. 145-31 of the French Commercial Code states that, unless otherwise provided in the lease, any
subletting, whether of the whole or parts of the premises, is prohibited.

Some of our premises are sublet to lessees through commercial subleases. The sublessee has the right to request
the lessee to renew its commercial sublease, but only for the remaining duration of the principal lease.

The termination of the principal lease at the end of its term automatically triggers the termination of the sublease,
without any compensation for the sublessee. The sublessee may be entitled to damages only in the case of an early
termination of the principal lease.

**Labor Law**

Labor and employment laws and regulations have a significant impact on our operations due to our large
workforce. As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 220,060 individuals worldwide, of which 70,420
people were employed in France, 101,230 people were employed in Brazil and 37,410 people were employed in
Colombia.

**_France_**

_Minimum wages and social security contributions_

Under French law, the relationship between an employer and an employee is regulated by applicable legislation,
the employment contract executed between both parties, as well as by the relevant national collective bargaining
agreements (“CBAs”) and local CBAs. CBAs are agreements entered into between one or several trade union
organizations representing employees, on the one hand, and an employer, or group of employers, on the other
hand. The French Labor Code (Code du travail) and CBAs constitute important sources of obligations relating to
working conditions for each industry they govern and relate to the individual and collective relationships between
employers and employees. All national CBAs provide for minimum wages that vary according to the classification
of the employee on the applicable pay scale. However, the wage of an employee cannot be below the minimum
national wage set by the French government (salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance or the “SMIC”),
and for overtime hours, minimum wages and SMIC must be paid at an increased rate. Trade unions renegotiate
the terms of the national CBAs almost every year, including the terms of any increase in the minimum wages for
each specified level of employee. Annual wage negotiations also take place at the company level and the French
government generally increases the SMIC every year. Companies to which such increases apply have an
obligation to implement these provisions by granting at least a corresponding salary increase, failing which
employees may bring legal claims for the enforcement of the relevant national CBA, back pay and damages.

We are further required to pay contributions for our employees to social security and other social insurance
schemes, which cover family allowances, illness, maternity leave, incapacity, retirement and death. Pursuant to
the Fillon Law, Law No. 2008-1258, dated December 3, 2008 and amended on December 29, 2014, we benefit
from reductions in certain contributions in respect of wages that amount to less than 160% of the SMIC. The
amount of this reduction is limited to 26% of gross salary, and it increases in inverse proportion to the amount of
gross salary (i.e., the reduction is lowest for a gross salary that is just under 160% of the statutory minimum wage,
but highest for a gross salary that is equal to the statutory minimum wage). Pursuant to a January 2011 amendment
of the Fillon Law, gross salary is calculated on a full-year basis (instead of the monthly statutory minimum wage,
as it had been previously calculated) and pursuant to a January 2012 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary
is deemed to include overtime, bonuses and supplementary working hours.

Pursuant to Article 1609 quinvicies of the French Tax Code, companies that are subject to the training tax and
have at least 250 employees may also be subject to the payment of a supplementary training contribution if
employees or trainees benefitting from specific training contracts (e.g., apprenticeship or professional training
contract, volunteer for international experience program) represent less than 5% of the workforce (subject to
certain exceptions). The rate of this supplementary training contribution depends in particular on the number of
such employees or trainees working for the company.

For compensation not subject to social security contributions (e.g., amounts paid pursuant to profit-sharing
agreements), employers must pay to the French tax authorities a flat social package, computed as a percentage of
the compensation paid to employees.

_Working time_

French working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 35 hours.
Overtime is paid according to an increased hourly rate, set out by national or local CBAs, or in the absence of
such rate, by the French Labor Code. An employer (both the company and its management) may be prosecuted
for offences of “undeclared work” (travail dissimulé) in connection with the failure to properly declare the time
worked beyond 35 hours per week, which may result in fines, imprisonment, the loss of certain reductions in
social security contributions and a prohibition on accessing public subsidies for employment, professional
education and culture. As a result of undeclared work, an employer may also be liable to employees for the
payment of a fixed penalty representing six months of salary, in the event of the termination of the employee’s
contract. In addition, non-compliance with legal provisions regarding overtime may expose the company or its
legal representative to additional fines. Moreover, because any compensation paid to an employee is subject to
the payment of social security contributions, social security contributions related to overtime hours may be
reassessed, which may result in the payment of additional social security contributions as well as additional
charges for the late payment of contributions, penalties for late declarations and fines. The French Labor Code,
however, provides for a certain degree of flexibility in applying the statutory weekly average working time of 35
hours per week for certain categories of employees.

Supervisory employees who have a certain amount of discretion in determining when and how they carry out their
work and for whom the working time cannot be predetermined and for whom the 35-hour weekly average may
therefore not be suitable, may be subject to working time clauses providing for a fixed number of working days
per year (forfait jour annuel) (a “per diem agreement”). Under French law, such clauses are implemented pursuant
to the provisions of the applicable national CBA, local CBA or company-level collective agreement. The rules
relating to minimum time off (a minimum of eleven consecutive hours per day of time off and a maximum of six
days of work per week, with Sunday off as a general rule) remain applicable, however, to employees on per diem
contracts. Employers must be certain, therefore, that tasks given to an employee paid on a per diem basis can be
performed within the maximum work periods, minimum time-off periods and a reasonable workload, which must
be monitored. If not, an employee working on a per diem basis can claim that his or her per diem employment
contract is unenforceable and can assert a claim for overtime pay for the preceding three years and damages.
Similarly, an employer may be subject to claims by employees for the payment of overtime corresponding to the
hours worked that exceed 35 hours per week, if their per diem arrangements do not comply with applicable legal
requirements.

The provisions in the French Labor Code in relation to working time do not apply to senior management (cadres
_dirigeants). “Senior management” is understood to mean executives and managers (i) under employment contract,_
(ii) who participate in the management of the company with significant responsibilities, (iii) with a significant
independence in the way their working time is organized, (iv) who are authorized to make decisions autonomously
and (v) who receive compensation in the highest brackets of the employer’s compensation schemes. These criteria
are cumulative. If a manager or executive believes that such criteria have not been met, he or she may assert a
claim in court for payment, in the form of overtime pay, for any work performed beyond 35 hours per week, over
the past three years and damages.

Given the nature of our services, some of our employees at certain of our locations are required to work on
Sundays, full day or at least in the morning. Under French law, the general rule is that Sunday should not be a
work day. French law provides limited exceptions to this general rule, which may, as the case may be, permanent
or temporary, be subject or not to authorization, applicable to the whole territory or to certain precisely delineated
areas. The applicable provisions were last amended, in substance, by the ‘‘Macron Law’’ for growth, activity and
equal economic opportunity (loi du 6 août 2015 pour la croissance, l’activité et l’égalité des chances
_économiques) that extended the possibilities of opening shops on Sundays in the international tourist areas and_
commercial areas defined by the national or local authorities. In such case, a specific collective agreement must
be negotiated with employee representatives, setting forth, among other things, the specific compensation granted
to employees who work on Sundays. A specific authorization from the office of the Prefect is no longer required.
French employees may work on Sundays only on a voluntary basis. We have negotiated collective agreements
related to work on Sundays.

_Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_

Under French law, an employer wishing to hire non-permanent workers may either (i) hire an employee under a
fixed-term employment contract or (ii) engage temporary workers through an agency. French law only allows
employers to use fixed-term employment contracts to perform specifically defined and temporary tasks in specific
circumstances provided by law (such as to replace an employee on a temporary leave of absence or whose
employment contract is suspended, to temporarily fill a position before an employee can be hired under a

190


-----

permanent employment contract or, after a permanent employee has left and before the position is eliminated, or
for a temporary increase in the company’s business). Fixed-term employment contracts may also be put in place
for seasonal jobs, which are subject to seasonal variations of activity. To be qualified as ‘‘seasonal,’’ variations
in a business activity must be regular, predictable, cyclical and, in any case, independent from employers and
employees. The Group puts in place numerous seasonal, fixed-term employment contracts, particularly to prepare
for the holiday selling season.

Fixed-term and temporary contracts are strictly regulated. A written contract is mandatory and a fixed-term
contract must include certain provisions (such as the grounds for resorting to such a fixed- term contract) and be
limited by time (i.e., a maximum of 18 months, reduced to 9 months or extended to 24 months in certain cases).
Termination and renewal of such contracts are also subject to mandatory statutory conditions. If the employer
does not comply with the mandatory provisions in respect of fixed-term employment contracts, employees may
seek to recharacterize fixed-term contracts as indefinite term employment contracts, in which case the employer
may be obligated to make certain additional payments (such as back pay) to employees, provide various
indemnities, including in respect of unserved notice periods, make severance payments and pay damages for unfair
dismissal. Non-compliance may result in fines and even, in the event of a repeated infringement, imprisonment.

_El Khomri Law_

The “El Khomri Law” concerning work, modernizing employee dialog and safeguarding professional careers (loi
_n°2016-1099 du 8 août 2016 relative au travail, à la modernisation du dialogue social et à la sécurisation des_
_parcours professionnels), which impacts the Group, contains various employer-friendly measures and has been_
voted by the French Parliament in 2016.

It provides that, among others:

  - In terms of working hours, local CBAs will prevail over national CBAs (with legal exceptions);

  - Since December 2016, the assessment of economic difficulties is based on legal criteria (significant
alteration of at least one economic indicator such as a decline in orders or in turnover, operating losses,
a deterioration of cash flow or EBITDA). The law quantifies the duration of the decline in orders or sales
which the employer will have to report to justify dismissal; and

  - The rules on validity and revision of collective agreements are modified. To be valid, local CBAs have
to be signed by one or more trade unions who received more than 50% of votes cast, in the last
professional elections (instead of the previous 30%).

_Gender equality_

The French Labor Code provides for the obligation for companies with a union section (section syndicale) to
negotiate on a periodic basis about gender equality. Since March 1, 2019, for companies with at least 1,000
employees, and since September 1, 2019, for companies with over 250 employees, and as from March 1, 2020,
for companies with at least 50 employees, shall also implement a 100-point index based on five criteria as follows:
(i) gap in remuneration, (ii) gap in individual increases, (iii) gap in the career progression between men and
women, (iv) percentage of employees whose remuneration has been increased at the end of their maternity leave
and (v) number of persons whose gender is underrepresented within the 10 highest remunerations of the company.
The distribution of the points between these categories is provided by the French Labor Code. If the company
obtains less than 75 points after the application of the criteria, it shall adopt corrective measures to reach at least
75 points. The company shall publish the results of its index on its website. A company that does not publish such
results or reach the threshold of 75 points, may be liable for the payment of a fine, which could amount up to 1%
of the wage bill.

_Employee representative bodies_

Pursuant to the French Labor Code, companies which headcount reached at least 11 employees during the 12
consecutive previous months shall set up a social and economic committee, which is the new combined employee
representative body created by the September 22, 2017 ordinances (ordonnances Macron), that replaces the staff
delegates (délégués du personnel), works council (comité d’entreprise) and health and safety committee (comité
_d’hygiène, de sécurité et des conditions de travail). On January 1, 2020 at the latest, all the concerned companies_
shall have set up a social and economic committee. In companies with at least 50 employees, the committee will
have the same powers as the works council, the health and safety committee and the staff delegates.

Until December 31, 2019 at the latest or earlier if the social and economic committee has been set up before that
deadline following the regular organization of professional elections according to the election calendar, the

191


-----

employee representative bodies currently implemented (i.e., works council, health and safety committee and staff
delegates) remain in force and keep their respective roles.

_Trade unions and negotiation of local CBAs_

A trade union delegate (délégué syndical) or a representative of a trade union section (représentant de la section
_syndicale) can be appointed within any company with a workforce of at least 50 employees (by exception, a staff_
delegate or a member of the social and economic committee can be appointed as a union delegate).

There are currently five trade unions that are recognized by the French government as being representative of
workers at a national level and, as such, are eligible to negotiate national collective bargaining agreements: Force
_ouvrière (FO), Confédération générale du travail (CGT), Confédération française de l’encadrement –_
_Confédération générale des cadres (CFE-CGC), Confédération française démocratique du travail (CFDT) and_
_Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens (CFTC). Representative trade unions may negotiate company_
and group-wide collective agreements.

Since May 1, 2018, local CBAs must be approved by trade unions representing more than 50% of the votes cast
during the last works council elections (as compared to 30% previously). Pursuant to the September 22, 2017
ordinance n°2017-1385, local CBAs can provide for less favorable provisions than those provided by national
CBAs, except for certain specific matters (such as employee job classification, minimum wage and benefits, and
fixed-term employment agreements).

Labor market reform in general continues to be a key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda,
and changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or
regulations could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, we rely on
our ability to negotiate or maintain in force certain collective agreements which provide us with the necessary
flexibility in particular for working-time and Sunday work. Changes in, or the termination of, collective
agreements may also substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

_Pacte law_

The “Pacte law” action plan for the growth and transformation of companies (Loi n° 2019-486 du 22 mai 2019
_relative à la croissance et la transformation des entreprises) includes changes in labor law, in particular:_

  - The simplification of social thresholds as from January 1, 2020: the law introduced (i) a unified
mechanism for counting the number of employees, with the social security workforce becoming the
reference (i.e. the average number of employees during each month of the previous calendar year), (ii) a
rationalization of the levels of workforce thresholds by giving priority to the 11, 50 and 250 employee
thresholds, (iii) a mechanism for smoothing the threshold effect following the crossing: the upward
crossing of an employee threshold will only be taken into account when this threshold has been reached
or exceeded for 5 consecutive calendar years, conversely, the downward crossing of an employee
threshold will be taken into account when the downward threshold has been reached for a full calendar
year.

  - Rules governing the allocation of profit-sharing reserves will change as from January 1, 2020:

`o` The remuneration taken into account to calculate the mandatory profit-sharing to be paid will
be limited to three times the annual social security contribution ceiling, rather than four times
previously.

`o` Regarding voluntary profit-sharing, the maximum amount that may be paid to a single
beneficiary for a given year has increased from 50% to 75% of the annual social security
contribution ceiling.

  - The presence of employees on the board of directors or supervisory boards, of companies or groups of
companies with more than 1,000 employees in France or 5,000 employees in France and abroad has been
strengthened with the appointment of at least two directors representing employees in companies whose
number of directors is greater than eight (instead of twelve) and at least one of it is less than or equal to
eight (instead of twelve). The text also reinforces the respect of gender parity rules on the board of
directors.

192


-----

_Social Security Financing Act for 2019_

To encourage the development of profit-sharing schemes, particularly in small and medium size companies, the
2019 Social Security Financing Act has abolished the employer’s flat contribution of 20% (“forfait social”) since
January 1, 2019, as follows:

  - On voluntary profit-sharing, for companies with less than 250 employees;

  - On mandatory profit-sharing, for companies with less than 50 employees.

**_Brazil_**

Employment relationships in Brazil are regulated primarily by the Brazilian Constitution, as updated by the labor
reform, and the Consolidation of Labor Laws (“CLT”) through Decree No. 5,452 of May 1, 1943.

_Collective bargaining agreements_

In Brazil, collective bargaining agreements relating to employment relationships prevail over individual
contractual agreements so long as the terms of the collective bargaining are more beneficial to the employee than
their employment contract. Nevertheless, the CLT provides for an exception wherein contractual terms of an
individual employment agreement will supersede collective bargained conditions where the employee has
individually negotiated their employment agreement and is a college graduate earning a threshold salary.

_Minimum wages and social security contributions_

The Brazilian federal government adjusts the national minimum wage annually, however each Brazilian state may
establish their own minimum wage, so long as such wage is above the national wage.

Both Brazilian employers and employees pay social security contributions. Individuals who receive compensation
from a Brazilian employer are subject to the local social security tax, which is withheld by the employer or other
source of income, as applicable. Individual social security contribution rates range from 8% to 11%, depending
on individual salaries. Employers’ social security contributions generally range from 26.8% to 28.8%, calculated
on the basis of each employee’s monthly salary. There is no cap on employers’ social security contributions.

_Working time_

Brazilian working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 44 hours
over a six-day period, with a cap of 10 hours per day. Employees who work in excess of this time period are
required to receive a minimum additional 50% of their regular pay, which increases to 100% if work is performed
on Sundays or holidays. This excess pay rate, as well as the limits to daily and weekly working hours, can be
changed under collective labor agreements.

_Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_

Brazilian law allows for temporary employment on the following conditions: the existence of a written contract
(subject to specific requirements related to the duration of employment), an employer’s justification for their
temporary need and an advance agreement as to salary. A company that wishes to extend the contract must make
a formal request in advance to the Ministry of Labor, subject to the limitation that a temporary contract may not
exceed six months.

Generally, temporary contracts may only be used to render services to meet a specific demand for a specified time
(such as seasonal holiday hires), for transitory company activities (as defined under Decree No. 10,060 of October
14, 2019) or as a probationary period for new hires during which time an employer can evaluate a new employee.

_Gender equality_

The Brazilian constitution and the CLT provide for the protection of all employees, including as to matters relating
to women’s participation in the labor market and their workplace rights.

_Employee representative bodies_

Under Brazilian law, all employers and employees are represented by a labor union. A labor union’s classification
(categoria syndical) depends on the (i) industry and (ii) location in which the employers and employees operate
(e.g., a single city, multiple cities, a single state or multiple states).

193


-----

Each class of employers and class of employees is represented by one labor union in a given industry and
geographic territory. All labor unions are required by law to have a collective bargaining agreement which must
cover all participants of their applicable union class.

_Trade unions and negotiation of local collective bargaining agreements_

Collective bargaining agreements in Brazil have the same status as the CLT and, consequently, employers must
comply with all of their provisions. Failure by employers to comply with the collective bargaining agreement to
which they are subject could subject them to contractual and administrative fines.

**_Colombia_**

_Minimum wages and social security contributions_

Labor and employment law in Colombia is regulated by the (i) Substantive Labor Code, establishing the laws
applicable to employment agreements, wages and hours, collective bargaining agreements, vacation and sick leave
and employment benefits and (ii) regulations and decisions issued by the Ministry of Labor and labor courts,
among other regulatory bodies. The current monthly minimum wage in Colombia is 828.116 pesos.

_Working time_

Colombian working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 48 hours
per week, not to exceed ten hours per day, for a maximum of six days per week. Employees may only work in
excess of these limits upon the authorization from the Colombian Ministry of Labor. Employers are required to
compensate employees at a rate of 35% higher than the employee’s regular rate of pay if they work over a threshold
amount of hours during the day. This excess pay increases to 75% higher than the employee’s regular rate of pay
if they work over a threshold amount of hours during the night. Employers are required to provide a minimum of
15 holidays per year, with Sundays and national holidays constituting mandatory rest periods. Employers are
required to compensate employees at a rate of 75% higher than their regular rate of salary if they are required to
work on a Sunday or holiday, in addition to ensuring that they have the right to an additional rest day.

_Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_

Fixed term agreements in Colombia are subject to restrictions in connection with their duration. For example,
fixed term agreements may not exceed a period of three years. To the extent such agreements provide a term of
employment of less than one year, they can only be renewed for three equal or lesser terms.

_Gender equality_

Colombia’s gender equality is rooted in its constitution, which recognizes women’s equality and outlaws genderbased discrimination. Employers are prohibited from any discriminatory action against their employees.

_Employee representative bodies_

Trade unions in Colombia are particularly prevalent in certain industry sectors, including the sugar, railway,
automotive, oil and mining sectors, as well as the public sector. A minimum of twenty-five workers is required to
establish a trade union in Colombia.

**Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters**

In addition to the foregoing regulations, in the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are
subject to national, regional and local laws and regulations of general applicability, such as laws on advertising,
regulations governing our relations with our suppliers and distributors, environmental, health and safety
regulations, including in connection with our gas and fuel service stations and regulations on energy use in
connection with our GreenYellow operations, among others.

**MANAGEMENT**

The following is a summary of certain information concerning the Issuer’s and CGP’s management, certain
provisions of the Issuer’s by-laws, CGP’s by-laws and French law regarding corporate governance. This summary
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the by-laws of the Issuer, the by-laws of CGP and French law, and it
does not purport to be complete.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer was established on November 3, 2017 for a term expiring on December 31, 2115 (unless it is wound
up before such date or its term is extended) and, on the Issue Date, will be the direct shareholder of 100% of the
share capital of IGC. The Issuer is organized as a société par actions simplifiée under the laws of France. The
Issuer is a holding company with no independent operations of its own and whose assets as of the Issue Date will
consist only of its direct interest in the share capital of IGC and intragroup receivables owed to it under the

195


-----

partnership, group, or company created with any other persons or companies, and complete, in any form
whatsoever, the transactions related to its purpose.

The by-laws of CGP as currently in force were last updated on June 13, 2019. CGP’s fiscal year begins on
January 1 and ends on December 31 of each year.

**Governance**

CGP is managed by a board of directors (conseil d’administration) (the “Board of Directors”) led by a chairman
(président). The Board of Directors, within the limits prescribed by French law, has the power to delegate its
general authority to a chief executive officer (directeur général) or certain managing directors (directeurs
_généraux délégués), which can be natural or legal persons. At CGP, the functions of chairman of the Board of_
Directors and of chief executive officer have been combined and Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of CGP, as well as its controlling shareholder, is the only director who performs executive
duties. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has broad managerial powers save for such functions and
powers reserved by law or CGP’s by-laws (statuts) to the Board of Directors or its shareholders.

CGP’s corporate governance practices are listed in the Board of Directors’ internal rules and principally include
the following:

  - specialized committees, including the Audit Committee, the Appointments and Compensation
Committee and the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (whose social responsibility duties
were extended at the end of 2017), led by independent Directors to support the Board of Directors’
functions;

  - compliance with the Afep-Medef Code concerning the proportion of independent Directors on the Board
of Directors and on each of the committees;

  - evaluation of significant and strategic transactions, as well as any specific issues which may arise in
CGP’s business operations, through either the Audit Committee or the creation of ad hoc committees of
independent Directors who may seek advice from independent experts;

  - annual meetings among the independent Directors of the Board of Directors, chaired by the Lead
Director, to review and provide recommendations to optimize the Board of Directors’ functioning, as
well as to monitor the implementation of previous recommendations;

  - the independent Lead Director’s work in preventing and managing conflicts of interest and her role vis a
vis the other independent Directors;

  - implementation of strict procedures to manage conflicts of interest, including the Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee examination of any exceptional issue that could give rise to a conflict of
interest, the Audit Committee’s practice since 2015 to review agreements between related parties and
related-party agreements and the Committees’ ability to obtain related independent expert advice
concerning these matters; and

  - periodic review and modification of the Board of Directors’ internal rules and each of the Committees’
charters.

In addition to the foregoing general governance practices, on June 13, 2019, the Board of Directors decided to
follow the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee’s recommendation to establish a specific governance
framework in response to the initiation of safeguard proceedings by CGP’s parent companies. The Board of
Directors agreed to give the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee, chaired by the Lead Director, the
authority and responsibility to address issues related to the safeguard proceedings, including:

  - the exchange of information between Rallye and CGP’s other parent companies concerning the
preparation, negotiation and implementation of their safeguard plans, and

  - the review of any decisions of CGP’s Board of Directors related to the implementation of the safeguard
plans or any decisions that could potentially be affected by CGP’s parent companies’ safeguard
proceedings, such as the Board of Directors’ potential decisions to implement or adjust the Asset
Disposal Plan, pay a dividend or enter into any related party transactions with any of the Group
companies involved in the safeguard proceedings.

This oversight framework is designed to ensure that CGP’s governance mechanisms are appropriately tailored to
address the recent developments of CGP’s parent companies and that the Board of Directors is in a position to

196


-----

continue to provide full and accurate information, make impartial and objective decisions in CGP’s best interests
and identify and manage any Directors’ potential conflicts of interest.

**_Powers of the Board of Directors and Restrictions on the Powers of the Chief Executive Officer_**

Article L. 225-56 of the French Commercial Code gives the chief executive officer unlimited powers to act on the
company’s behalf in all circumstances. The chief executive officer exercises his powers within the scope of the
company’s corporate purposes and subject to those powers specifically vested by law in the shareholders at
shareholders’ meetings or in the Board of Directors. The chief executive officer represents the company in its
dealings with third parties.

Consistent with the Group’s principles of corporate governance, certain management transactions meeting a predetermined threshold are submitted to the Board of Directors for prior approval based on the type of transaction
and/or the amounts involved. The applicable thresholds ensure that the Board of Directors will review CGP’s most
important transactions, in accordance with law and the principles of good corporate governance.

Specifically, the Chief Executive Officer is required to obtain the Board of Directors’ prior authorization for the
following:

  - any transaction that could potentially affect CGP’s and/or any of its controlled subsidiaries’ strategy,
financial structure or scope of business, particularly transactions that could significantly impact CGP’s
future development, such as entering into or terminating industrial and commercial agreements; and

  - any transaction that exceeds €500 million and, in particular, any subscription for or purchase of securities,
any immediate or deferred investment in any company or business venture, any contribution or exchange
of assets, with or without additional compensation, concerning goods, rights or securities, any acquisition
of real property or real property rights, any purchase or sale of receivables, acquisitions or divestments
of goodwill or other intangible assets, any issue of securities by directly or indirectly controlled
companies, the granting or obtaining loans, borrowings, credit facilities or short-term advances, any
settlement of or compromises to settle legal disputes, any disposal of real property or real property rights,
any full or partial divestments of equity interests, or the granting of any lien, security interest, surety, or
guarantee.

As an exception to the above rules, however, the Chief Executive Officer may, on an exceptional basis and upon
obtaining the binding opinion of the Audit Committee as to whether the terms of a transaction fairly balance the
interests of both parties, perform any transaction not exceeding 15% of consolidated equity as measured at the
previous fiscal year-end. The Chief Executive Officer must report on any such transaction at the Board of
Directors’ meeting.

These provisions apply to transactions entered into both directly by CGP and by any of CGP’s directly or indirectly
controlled subsidiaries, except for intragroup transactions. In addition, every year the Chief Executive Officer is
also given the authority to issue and enter into all types of guarantees and to carry out financing transactions.
These authorizations are renewed annually upon the recommendation of the Governance and Social Responsibility
Committee and were most recently renewed in December 2018 for the year 2019.

Pursuant to this authority, the Chief Executive Officer may do the following:

  - issue security interests, collateral or guarantees to third parties in CGP’s name on behalf of third parties
for up to €1.5 billion per year and €500 million per commitment;

  - negotiate, accept and/or roll over, extend or renew loans, confirmed credit lines and syndicated or nonsyndicated financing facilities for up to €3.5 billion per year and €500 million per transaction;

  - negotiate, accept, roll over, extend or renew cash advances for up to €1 billion in light of the seasonality
of the business;

  - issue bonds or other debt securities (other than commercial paper) under the EMTN Program or otherwise
for up to €3.5 billion, decide the terms and conditions of any such issues and carry out all related market
transactions;

  - issue commercial paper for a maximum of €2 billion; and

  - buy back and redeem outstanding debt securities in an annual nominal amount of €1 billion.

In addition to these specific annual authorizations, the Chief Executive Officer may act in CGP’s name to
guarantee all commitments given by Casino Finance on behalf of third parties in connection with:

  - the issuance of bonds, including those under Casino Finance’s EMTN program, commercial paper and/or
other debt securities, and the execution of loan agreements for all borrowings, confirmed lines of credit,
financing facilities and short term advance facility agreements within the same annual limits and limits
per transaction defined above for the annual authorizations; and

  - foreign currency transactions and derivative transactions covered by an ISDA master agreement or a
Fédération Bancaire Française agreement signed by Casino Finance, for an amount up to €100 million
per bank and €1.2 billion in total.

is to be elected by the Board of Directors from among the independent Members of the Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee on the non-binding proposal of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer following a

**_Board Committees_**

The Board of Directors has established the following three specialized committees that report to the Board of
Directors: the Audit Committee, the Appointments and Compensation Committee and the Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee.

The members of these Committees are appointed by the Board of Directors, which is also responsible for
appointing their respective Chairs. The Committees’ composition and organization are reviewed each year by the
Appointments and Compensation Committee, the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee and the
Board of Directors. When selecting Committee members, the Board of Directors takes into account their
professional background and expertise.

The specific roles, duties and functions of each Committee are defined and are regularly reviewed by the Board
of Directors. They are included in the Board of Directors’ internal rules and in the Charter prepared for each
Committee describing their respective organization and rules of procedure.

Board of Directors’ meetings generally take place after a meeting of one or more Committees depending on the
items on the agenda of the Board of Directors’ meeting. The Committees report to the Board of Directors on their
work and observations and, where appropriate, inform the Board of Directors of their opinions, proposals or
recommendations in each of their respective fields of expertise.

The Board of Directors may also decide at any time to set up an ad hoc committee of independent Directors to
examine a specific issue. Pursuant to the internal rules of the Audit Committee and of the Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee, such committees must consist of at least three members, at least two of whom must be
independent Directors within the meaning of the criteria in the Afep-Medef Code. With respect to the
Appointments and Compensation Committee, the internal rules impose a minimum of three members, the majority
of whom must be independent.

As part of its work, each Committee may organize meetings with CGP’s senior management, and that of its
subsidiaries should it deem necessary and, on its own initiative, may use the services of external experts and
request any information it needs to carry out its functions. During the board meetings, the Committees present
oral reports on their work and written reports are made available to the Directors.

_Audit Committee_

The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in reviewing annual and interim financial
statements and in dealing with transactions or events that could have a material impact on CGP or its subsidiaries.
The Audit Committee’s members are Frédéric Saint-Geours and the independent Directors Laure Hauseux and
Catherine Lucet.

The proportion of independent Directors on the Committee complies with the two-thirds threshold recommended
by the Afep-Medef Code. All members of the Audit Committee hold or have held senior executive positions and
therefore have the financial or accounting skills required by Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code

The Audit Committee meets to review the annual and interim financial statements at least two days before the
Board of Directors meeting held to approve them. Pursuant to Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code,
the Committee deals with matters relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information.
It reviews the terms and conditions applicable to approving the financial statements, as well as the type, scope and
outcome of the work undertaken by the statutory auditors for CGP and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, it is tasked
with tracking the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and the audit of the financial
statements of CGP and the Group by the statutory auditors, as well as the statutory auditors’ independence. To
this end, the statutory auditors present their audit work and findings to the Committee. At least twice a year, the
Audit Committee meets alone with the statutory auditors without any CGP representatives. Additional meetings
with the statutory auditors and with the internal audit manager may be arranged at the Committee’s request. The
Committee also organizes the statutory auditor selection process.

Since February 15, 2015, the Audit Committee has also reviewed all material agreements between CGP or its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and related parties prior to their execution. The purpose of this review is to help prevent
the risk of conflicts of interest and to protect minority shareholders. The Committee informs the senior
management and the Board of Directors of its opinion on these agreements as to whether the transaction assessed
falls within the scope of the related party procedure and fairly balances the interests of CGP and the related party.

The Audit Committee’s powers and duties, notably those concerning risk analysis and the detection and prevention
of management errors, are set out in a charter. The charter was updated on December 14, 2018 following the
Committee’s adoption of a revised procedure for the approval of non-audit services that may be provided by the
statutory auditors and further updated on March 13, 2019. Its powers and duties are also described in the Board
of Directors’ internal rules.

_Appointments and Compensation Committee_

The Appointments and Compensation Committee is tasked with assisting the Board of Directors in reviewing (i)
candidates for senior management and in selecting future Directors in line with the criteria and standards set by
the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee to ensure, among other things, candidates’ sufficient
complementarity of expertise and Board’s diversity, (ii) the human capital development and succession plan, (iii)
the independence of Directors, (iv) corporate executive officer compensation, (v) CGP’s grants of stock options
or free shares and (vi) the implementation of employee shareholder plans. As of October 11, 2019, the
Appointments and Compensation Committee’s members are Nathalie Andrieux (independent Director), Laure
Hauseux (independent Director), Gilbert Delahaye and David de Rothschild.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer participates in the Appointments and Compensation Committee’s
selection and appointment process for Director and the Lead Director roles and its review of CGP’s non-corporate
officer compensation policy for key executives.

The role and responsibilities of the Appointments and Compensation Committee are set out in its charter, which
was most recently amended on March 13, 2019, according to which its role of reviewing annual social and
environmental information and CGP’s gender parity policy was transferred to the Governance and Social
Responsibility Committee in connection with the broadening of that Committee’s social responsibility role. The
Board of Directors’ internal rules, also amended, describe these responsibilities.

_Governance and Social Responsibility Committee_

The Governance and Social Responsibility Committee monitors the development of governance rules, oversees
their proper application and proposes any appropriate adjustments to such rules to align with CGP’s needs. In
particular, the Committee is responsible for monitoring subjects relating to rules of ethics and conduct as
applicable to Directors, including managing Board conflicts of interest, as well as determining the terms and
conditions of, and conducting assessments of, the Board’s organization and functioning. The Committee also
periodically reviews the Board of Directors’ structure, size and composition. The Governance and Social

204


-----

Responsibility Committee’s members are Catherine Lucet, Nathalie Andrieux, Christiane Féral-Schuhl, who are
all independent Directors, and Frédéric Saint-Geours.

The purpose and organizational rules governing the Committee are described in a specific charter that was
amended and approved most recently by the Board of Directors on December 15, 2017. The Board of Directors’
internal rules also set out the Committee’s responsibilities.

The scope of the Committee’s duties in the area of social responsibility was recently broadened to ensure the
involvement of individuals at the highest level of CGP’s management in social responsibility issues. The
Committee is thus responsible for reviewing CGP’s commitments and policies in the area of ethics, rules of
conduct and corporate social, environmental and societal responsibility, and for implementing these policies and
tracking their results in line with CGP’s social responsibility strategy. In this respect, together with the Audit
Committee, it provides a framework to identify and manage the principal risks relating to these areas and
compliance with applicable law and regulations. It reviews the Group’s participation in non-financial indices. It
also reviews the information provided annually in the management report relating to non-financial information
under applicable law and CGP’s gender parity policy, both of which were responsibilities previously entrusted to
the Appointments and Compensation Committee.

Furthermore, as mentioned under “—Governance” above, the Board of Directors recently agreed to give the
Governance and Social Responsibility Committee, chaired by the Lead Director, the authority and responsibility
to address issues related to the safeguard proceedings.

**_Remunerations, Other Benefits, Share Ownership_**

The Board of Directors uses the Afep-Medef Code as its reference for the principles that guide its executive
compensation policies. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation is based on the
recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors ensures that the
compensation policy is consistent with CGP’s corporate interests, the interests of its shareholders and stakeholders
and the compensation policies applied to members of the Executive Committee and the Group’s employees.

The total compensation paid to Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri by CGP, in respect of his role as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of CGP, amounted to €946,520 for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, consisting of
fixed compensation, annual variable compensation and directors’ fees. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
was not, and has never been, awarded any stock options, bonus shares or performance shares from CGP. He is
expressly excluded from the list of beneficiaries of these types of compensation under the terms of the resolutions
voted at the Extraordinary General Meetings of May 7, 2017 and May 15, 2018. At its meeting on March 13,
2019, the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee,
set the principles and structure of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation for 2019, which was
largely in line with the compensation approved the prior year.

At their Annual General Meeting in May 19, 2009, the shareholders set the maximum total amount of directors’
fees to be allocated to the Directors and the members of the Board’s specialized Committees at €650,000. The
method of allocating the directors’ fees as voted by the shareholders for 2017 (paid in 2018) between Directors
and members of the Board’s specialized Committees was determined by the Board of Directors on December 15,
2017 based on the recommendations of the Appointments and Compensation Committee. The total directors’ fees
paid in 2019 in respect of 2018 to the members of the Board of Directors and the Board’s specialized Committees
amounted to €537,439, as compared to the €459,196 paid in 2018 in respect of 2017.

Pursuant to the terms of our Articles of Association, each Director must own at least 100 CGP shares. Our internal
rules also state that each Director elected at an Annual General Meeting, whether a natural person, legal entity or
permanent representative, also undertakes to hold a number of shares, the amount of which corresponds to at least
one year of directors’ fees, with the possibility of using said directors’ fees to acquire such shares. The Articles of
Association exempt Directors representing employees from complying with this requirement, as required by law.

Our executive compensation policy is designed to encourage and reward performance, both in terms of the
Group’s results and on an individual level, and to ensure competitive compensation positioning relative to general
market practices. Total compensation paid to members of our Executive Committee comprises a fixed and variable
component. The variable component is contingent on the achievement of various objectives and can represent up
to 50% of the fixed component if the objectives are met and up to 100% if they are exceeded. In 2018, the total
gross fixed and variable compensation paid by CGP and its controlled subsidiaries to Executive Committee
members (not including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), excluding exceptional bonuses, amounted to
€21 million, including a variable component of €9.5 million in respect of 2018 and €39,000 in benefits in kind.

As employees, Executive Committee members may receive stock options and/or share grants as part of our policy
to retain key people by giving them a stake in the Group’s development. Share grants are contingent on the

205


-----

achievement of performance conditions specific to CGP and on the beneficiary being employed by CGP on the
vesting date or on the exercise date for stock options. No stock option plans have been set up since April 29, 2010.
CGP may also make one-off share grants to employees who have made a significant contribution to strategic or
highly complex transactions. In 2018, nine Executive Committee members were granted 190,865 bonus shares
either contingent on a service requirement and performance conditions or on a one-off basis. A total of 125,117
bonus shares vested to six Executive Committee members in 2018.

(1) The number of rights to vote at the Annual General Meeting is not the same as the voting rights published under France’s disclosure
threshold rules (theoretical voting rights). For the monthly publication of the total number of voting rights and the number of shares
comprising the share capital, the total number of voting rights is calculated based on all the shares that potentially carry voting rights,
including shares stripped of voting rights (treasury shares), in accordance with Article 223-11 of the AMF General Regulations.

(2) CGP holds 928 shares through its indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, Germinal SNC.

(3) Voting rights that will become exercisable again if the underlying shares cease to be held as treasury stock.

(4) On December 31, 2018, Rallye held 39.11% of the share capital (45.39% of the voting rights) directly and 51.75% of the share capital

(63.46% of the voting rights) indirectly through two subsidiaries which held more than 5% of the share capital and/or voting rights.
These subsidiaries are Cobivia, which holds 8.29% of the share capital and 11.86% of the voting rights, and HMB, which holds 4.28%
of the share capital and 6.12% of the voting rights. On July 31, 2015, Rallye signed an equity swap agreement on 840,495 notional shares
expiring on July 31, 2018. The swap could be settled through physical delivery of underlying shares. The agreement was settled on
March 9, 2018 when the title transfer option was exercised on 840,495 shares (AMF 2018DD541587). On October 3, 2018, Alpétrol
(the lender), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rallye, and Rallye (the borrower) entered into a securities lending agreement on 6,681,492
CGP shares (AMF 2018DD578901 – AMF 2018DD578908). The lent shares were stripped of double voting rights (AMF 218C1648).
On February 28, 2019, Cobivia (the lender) and HMB (the lender), subsidiaries of Rallye, and Rallye (the borrower) entered into
securities lending agreements on 6,866,554 CGP shares and 2,721,459 CGP shares respectively (AMF 2019DD597522 – AMF
2019DD597523 – AMF 2019DD597521). The lent shares were stripped of double voting rights (AMF 219C0420). On February 28,
2019, Rallye held 47.85% of the share capital (55.09% of the voting rights) directly and a total of 51.75% of the share capital (61.03%
of the voting rights) indirectly through three subsidiaries which held less than 5% of the share capital and/or voting rights.

Nearly all of CGP’s shares have been pledged to secure outstanding debt of Rallye and its subsidiaries. In this respect, Rallye has also
entered into structured financing arrangements (in the form of prepaid forward contracts and equity swaps) with certain financial
institutions, which are secured by pledges over 9.5 million CGP shares (or 8.7% of CGP’s share capital) that are capable of being
enforced during its ongoing safeguard proceeding.

(5) As of September 4, 2019, Vesa Equity Investment S.à.r.l., controlled by partners Daniel Křetínský and Patrik Tkáč, holds 5,020,139

shares of CGP, representing 4.63% of its share capital.

_Double Voting Rights_

Statutory provisions relating to double voting rights were introduced by the Extraordinary General Meeting of
November 30, 1934 and amended by the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 21, 1987 (Article 28-III of the
Articles of Association). With respect to voting rights, Article 28-III of the Company’s Articles of Association
stipulates as follows:

_“Shareholders hold as many votes as the shares he or she holds or represents, without limitation,_
_with the only exception of the cases provided for by law or in the Articles of Association._

_However, a double voting right is assigned to all fully paid-up shares effectively held in registered_
_form in the name of the same shareholder for at least four years, as well as, in the event of a share_

207


-----

_capital increase via capitalization of reserves, profits, or issue premiums, to those registered_
_shares granted free of charge to a shareholder in connection with old shares for which he or she_
_is entitled to this right._

_The double voting right is forfeited ipso jure for any share that was converted to bearer-form or_
_that was subject to a transfer of ownership except in the event of a transfer in which the shares_
_remain in registered form, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225-124 of the French Commercial_
_Code._

_The vote or proxy issued by an intermediary that has either not declared itself as an intermediary_
_registered as a holder of securities on behalf of third parties not domiciled in France, or has not_
_disclosed the identity of the owners of the shares for which it is a registered intermediary, in_
_accordance with regulations in force, will not be counted”._

Double voting rights may be withdrawn by decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting, after approval by a
special meeting of holders of double voting rights. As of December 31, 2018, a total of 153,413,553 voting rights
were attached to 108,766,697 shares with voting rights in issue. The number of voting rights is different from the
number of shares comprising the share capital due to the double voting right attached to registered shares, as well
as the direct or indirect holding by the Company of a certain number of its own shares. Taking into account the
gain or loss of double voting rights by certain shareholders since January 1, 2019 and the number of treasury
shares held directly or indirectly, a total of 143,807,310 voting rights were attached to 108,785,869 shares carrying
voting rights as of February 28, 2019.

**Related Party Transactions**

We maintain normal relations with all of our subsidiaries in our day-to-day operations. Due to our legal and
operational structure, all or some of our companies may also engage in business relations to provide services to
each other. In addition, all or some of our companies may also engage in business relations with our parent
companies and/or their subsidiaries. While the French Commercial Code provides for prior authorization of related
party agreements, such authorization is intended to apply principally to agreements to which CGP is a direct party,
and does not address the routine agreements our companies or our parent companies’ various subsidiaries may
enter into in the ordinary course of our business operations. To address these intra-group transactions, and in order
to prevent conflicts of interest which may arise from them, in 2015 CGP’s Board of Directors developed a
procedure for the review of related party transactions by the Audit Committee. Following the Audit Committee’s
recommendation, the Board of Directors approved a charter describing the Audit Committee’s related party
transaction review procedures. The Board of Directors’ internal rules also reflect the Audit Committee’s role in
related party transaction review.

Pursuant to this procedure, prior to presentation for Board approval, the Audit Committee examines all agreements
between CGP or its wholly owned subsidiaries and other companies in the Group, as well as controlling companies
and companies accounted for by the equity method in our consolidated financial statements, where the value of
the transaction in question, either individually or in total with other transactions between the same parties during
the same fiscal year, exceeds €10 million. In addition, if the total value of the transactions between the parties
within the same fiscal year exceeds €10 million, then the Audit Committee will review any additional transaction
between the related parties that exceeds €1 million. The Audit Committee may rely on studies or reports produced
by external specialist consultants in conducting its review. Following its review, the Audit Committee is required
to provide an opinion as to whether the terms of the assessed transaction fairly balance the interests of both parties.

This procedure does not apply to agreements between CGP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries or among CGP’s
wholly-owned subsidiaries themselves to the extent such agreements concern routine ordinary course transaction,
tax consolidation agreements (provided such agreements do not place one of the parties in a less favorable position
than if it had been elected to be taxed on a standalone basis) or the issuance of a guarantee or a payment for a
guarantee, provided such issuances are consistent with normal practices.

Moreover, senior management may request the Audit Committee to review any other agreements that do not fall
within the scope of the Audit Committee’s related party transaction review procedure thresholds. The Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Audit Committee may also request the Board of Directors to
consider the creation of an ad hoc committee to review significant related party transactions.

The Audit Committee issued a favorable opinion on all of the transactions it reviewed in 2018, concluding that
their terms fairly balanced the interests of both parties, based on the reports of external experts. Each year, senior
management presents a report to the Audit Committee detailing all related party agreements entered into during
the prior year, as well as any transactions qualifying for the above-mentioned exceptions to the Audit Committee’s

208


-----

procedures. The report presented to the Audit Committee for 2018 concluded that there is no need to further widen
the scope of the review procedure.

Our related party transactions include our transactions with Euris, our holding company, and Mercialys. We
receive strategic support from Euris, which in turn provides strategy and development consultancy services under
an agreement signed in 2003 and the amendments thereto. In 2018, we paid €760,000 for these services, excluding
taxes.

We are also party to an agreement with Mercialys whereby we will reimburse the specific expenses borne by
Mercialys in connection with the sale process of all or part of our interest in Mercialys’ capital, as follows: (i)
external expenses, corresponding mainly to legal advisor’s fees, to be reimbursed upon presentation of vouchers
and up to a maximum aggregate amount of €200,000 excluding VAT for the period through December 31, 2019,
and (ii) exceptional compensation, including related payroll taxes, which would be paid by Mercialys to its top
management whose roles are critical in organizing the smooth completion of the sale process, representing a lump
sum amount of three months’ fixed compensation for 2018, for a total amount of €236,250, plus payroll taxes for
an estimated aggregate amount of €303,200. In addition, Casino Finance has entered into a current account and
cash management agreement with Mercialys, expiring on December 31, 2020. Under this agreement, Casino
Finance provides Mercialys with a credit facility of up to €50 million.

CGP’s Director, David de Rothschild was managing partner of Rothschild & Cie and members of his family hold
positions directly or indirectly in Rothschild & Cie. Rothschild & Cie has provided investment banking and other
services to the Group, including liquidity contracts.

In connection with the Refinancing, IGC and DCF have entered into the New Master Lease Agreement. For a
description of the terms of the New Master Lease Agreement, see “Summary—IGC—The Latam Reorganization
_Transactions”._ The Group also plans to simplify its Latin American holding structure through a number of
interrelated transactions. For details on these transactions, see “Summary—The Latam Reorganization
_Transactions”._

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements in addition to the_
_Indenture. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of such_
_arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements. Capitalized terms used in_
_the following respective summaries and not otherwise defined in this Listing Prospectus have the meanings_
_ascribed to them in their respective agreements._

**Overview**

Following the completion of this Offering and, if applicable, the release of the proceeds of the Offering from
escrow, our principal outstanding indebtedness will include the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term
Loan B Facility, the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, CGP’s outstanding bonds (including both our Existing
EMTN Bonds and Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes (each as defined below)), CGP’s commercial
paper program and indebtedness at certain of our Latam subsidiaries, each of which are summarized in further
detail below, and the Notes.

The material terms of these credit facilities, as well as a summary of the outstanding indebtedness of GPA and
Grupo Éxito, are discussed in further detail below.

**New Revolving Credit Facility**

On or prior to the Escrow Release Date, CGP, Casino Finance and Monoprix are expected to enter into the New
Revolving Credit Facility, in an initial aggregate amount of up to €2.0 billion, as borrowers with, among others
BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse International and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, as mandated lead arrangers and
bookrunners. Borrowings may be used for refinancing of certain existing financial indebtedness and/or general
corporate purposes. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized to and including the business day that is
one month prior to the maturity date. The maturity date is the date which is the earlier of October 31, 2023 and, if
the 2023 EMTN Bonds are not repaid or refinanced in full (or sums sufficient to repay the 2023 EMTN Bonds
have not been placed in a Segregated Account) by October 31, 2022, October 31, 2022.

CGP will be entitled to request incremental revolving facilities by way of an increase of the New Revolving Credit
Facility. Such incremental facilities can only be incurred within twelve (12) months from the closing date of the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and within the basket of permitted financial indebtedness under the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, and in particular, the
absence of default which is continuing or would result from the proposed incremental facility.

**_Swingline Component_**

In addition to the revolving advances provided for under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the terms of which
are described in further detail below, the facility provides for swingline advances (in an amount up to €400
million), to be used for general corporate purposes.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will benefit from guarantees from certain members of the Group which are
Notes Guarantors. The borrowers and guarantors will provide security over the shares in certain members of the
group, intra-group receivables and bank accounts. In particular, CGP will grant security over the shares it holds
in Casino Participations France, but its enforcement will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
See “—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement of Security—Enforcement Instructions—Senior Lender Liabilities
_Security”._

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement described below
under the heading “—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The rate of interest on revolving advances of loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be calculated at
a percentage per annum that is the sum of (1) an applicable margin that may be adjusted subject to certain
conditions based on the consolidated gross debt (being current and non-current financial liabilities (emprunts et
_dettes financières courantes et non courantes) as shown in the consolidated financial statements of CGP (or, as_
the case may be, as set out in the quarterly reporting required to be made by CGP pursuant to the New Revolving

210

Credit Facility)) (net of proceeds on the Segregated Account(s) and the Bond Segregated Account(s)) to
consolidated EBITDA ratio (calculated as provided for therein) as follows:

**Ratio of consolidated gross debt**

**to consolidated EBITDA** **Margin % p.a.**

Greater than 5.50:1 3.50

Greater than 4.50:1 but less than or equal to 5.50:1 3.00

Greater than 3.50:1 but less than or equal to 4.50:1 2.50

Greater than 2.50:1 but less than or equal to 3.50:1 2.00

Less than or equal to 2.50:1 1.50

and (2) EURIBOR or LIBOR. The initial margin under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be 3.50% _per_
_annum. The rate of interest will be subject to increase by 1.00 % for amounts that are overdue. Interest payments_
for each revolving advance will be due at the end of the term for the advance, which may be a term of one, three
or six months, or any other period otherwise agreed to.

CGP will also generally be required to pay certain other fees under the New Revolving Credit Facility, including
commitment, utilization and other fees. Commitment fees will accrue on available commitment under the New
Revolving Credit Facility at a per annum rate equal to 35% of the then applicable margin. Utilization fees will be
payable on drawn amounts at a per annum rate ranging from 0.40% to 1.25% according to the percentage of the
New Revolving Credit Facility which is utilized.

**_Conditions to Drawdown_**

The availability of loans (other than rollover loans) under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to
certain conditions precedent, including absence of default which is continuing or would result from the proposed
loan and certain customary representations and warranties made in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
being true in all material respects. Rollover loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to the
absence of events of default related to non-payment, financial covenants, insolvency or insolvency proceedings.

The conditions precedent to drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility will also include, inter alia, the
provision of evidence by CGP that net cash proceeds for an amount in aggregate of at least €1,000,000,000 have
been raised: (i) on or prior to 15 May 2020 from capital market issuance and/or the New Term Loan B Facility
(each with a final maturity ending after the termination date of the New Revolving Credit Facility); and/or (ii)
from disposals (excluding disposal proceeds in connection with certain disposals) received on or prior to 15
May 2020 which have been either: (A) applied immediately in the repayment of existing financial indebtedness;
or (B) either: (1) immediately placed on the Segregated Account; or (2) designated to be credited to the
Segregated Account within ninety (90) days of the relevant disposal.

**_Repayments_**

Each loan made under the New Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on the last day of the interest
period for the loan advance. An interest period may not extend after the final maturity date of the New Revolving
Credit Facility. Amounts repaid may be reborrowed, save for certain exceptions.

In addition, if, on March 31, 2021 the total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility exceed
€2,000,000,000, the excess amount of commitments will be cancelled on such date.

**_Prepayment – change of control_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide for mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of a
change of control of either CGP, Casino Finance or Monoprix.

Change of control of CGP will be defined in a manner similar to that under the Indenture. A change of control of
Casino Finance will be defined as any person or group of persons acting in concert (other than Rallye and its
affiliates) gaining control (as defined by art. L.233-3 of French Code du Commerce) of Casino Finance. A change
of control of Monoprix will be defined as CGP or any of its subsidiaries no longer controlling (as defined by art.
L.233-3 of French Code du Commerce) Monoprix S.A.S., or CGP or any of its subsidiaries holding less than 40%
of Monoprix S.A.S.’s share capital or voting rights.

If a change of control of CGP or Casino Finance occurs, each lender will be entitled to request that its
commitments under the applicable facility be cancelled, with all amounts outstanding thereunder subsequently
becoming due and payable, within 30 business days together with accrued interest. If a change of control with

211


-----

respect to Monoprix occurs, each Lender will only be entitled to require cancellation of one-third of its
commitments.

**_Prepayment – disposal proceeds_**

CGP and the borrowers will be obliged to apply the cash proceeds of certain asset disposals in mandatory
prepayment and cancellation of the facilities. A number of exceptions will apply and, in particular, proceeds will
not be required to be applied if the cash proceeds from any individual disposal are in an amount of less than
€50,000,000 or if the aggregate cash proceeds from disposals do not exceed €100,000,000 in any financial year.
In addition, no prepayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility further to a disposal will be
required if it results in the amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility and commitments under other committed
corporate credit facilities with a maturity no earlier than that of the New Revolving Credit Facility being less than
€2,000,000,000.

**_Prepayment – voluntary prepayment and cancellation_**

Indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily cancelled or prepaid, upon providing
the requisite notice, without penalty or premium (subject to applicable break costs), in whole or in part, subject to
certain conditions, including with respect to minimum amounts. Amounts prepaid may be reborrowed, subject to
certain conditions. Commitments cancelled may not be reinstated.

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain information and negative and affirmative covenants,
including covenants applicable to CGP, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S, with certain covenants applying to
their subsidiaries, or, as the case may be, to CGP’s principal subsidiaries, defined as any subsidiary of CGP
accounting for 10% or more of CGP’s consolidated total assets and/or consolidated turnover (calculated on the
basis of the Group (being CGP and its subsidiaries excluding the LATAM Group but including Segisor and all of
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (other than CBD and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries) and Tevir and all of

and the preservation of the assets below those companies the shares of which are subject to security in favor of
the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and provision of financial and other information. The
provisions will also be subject to a most favored nation procedure, which is intended to ensure that relevant
undertakings remain no less restrictive than those applicable under the Indenture. Such covenants are subject to
agreed exceptions and thresholds.

**_Financial Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require CGP to maintain a consolidated gross debt (as defined
above) (net of proceeds on the Segregated Account(s) and the Bond Segregated Account(s)) to EBITDA ratio and
an interest cover ratio, each tested for the first time on March 31, 2020 and thereafter each tested quarterly (unless
the ratio of consolidated gross debt to EBITDA is 3.50:1 or less, in which case the ratios will be tested semiannually). The ratio of consolidated gross debt to EBITDA on each of the test dates in the table below must not

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain customary events of default (subject in certain cases

and its principal subsidiaries. The events of default will include payment default, failure to comply with the
financial covenants described above, failure to comply with any other obligations in the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the related finance documents, misrepresentation, cross-default, insolvency, insolvency
proceedings, creditors’ process, cessation of business, failure to comply with judgments, litigation, loss of
ownership of obligors, unlawfulness of obligations or audit qualifications.

The occurrence of an event of default will allow the agent (if so directed by lenders representing 66[2/3]% of the
total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility) to (i) declare all or any part of any borrowings
thereunder to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued interest (ii) cancel the total commitments
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and/or (iii) exercise or direct the security agent to exercise rights under

**_Governing Law_**

**New Term B Loan Facility**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On or prior to the Escrow Release Date, CGP, DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. will enter into the New
Term Loan B Facility Agreement with, among others, Credit Suisse International as agent and Citibank, N.A.,
London Branch as security agent, and BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse International as physical bookrunners, BNP
Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs
International, HSBC Bank plc, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Natixis as global coordinators, mandated lead
arrangers and joint bookrunners and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company,
Crédit Mutuel-CIC, Santander and Société Générale as joint bookrunners.

The New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will provide for the committed senior secured New Term Loan B
Facility.

The New Term Loan B Facility will be utilized by CGP and may be used to (i) refinance any financial indebtedness
of the Group existing on the date of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement including payment of related fees,
costs and expenses payable in connection with such refinancing or (ii) with respect to any amounts not applied
for the purpose described in (i), in payment directly to the Segregated Account (under and as defined in the New
Term Loan B Facility Agreement).

The New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will include the ability to incur additional senior secured indebtedness
under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement (by way of increase of, or under one or more additional facilities
documented within, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement) up to an aggregate amount which shall not exceed
the sum of (a) an amount that would result in the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio immediately after
giving effect to the incurrence of such additional indebtedness being greater than as at the first utilization date of
the New Term Loan B Facility (the “Closing Date”) (plus available capacity under the credit facilities basket in
the covenant on incurrence of debt) and (b) solely for the purposes of the repurchase or repayment of certain of
the Group’s unsubordinated medium term notes, an amount equal to the greater of €280.0 million and 30% of
LTM EBITDA (provided that only €100.0 million of such basket may be applied towards the repurchase or
repayment of the Group’s unsubordinated medium term notes which mature after the maturity date of the New
Term Loan B Facility), in each case, subject to certain other conditions being met.

In addition, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will permit the incurrence of debt outside the New Term
Loan B Facility Agreement subject to the covenant on incurrence of debt.

The New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will also require that certain creditors in respect of indebtedness which
is secured by the same collateral securing the New Term Loan B Facility and which is permitted to be incurred
under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, including pursuant to certain ratio tests and baskets, accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

213

**_Availability_**

The New Term Loan B Facility will be available on and from the date of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement
up to (and including) the earlier of (i) 15 May 2020 and (ii) the Closing Date.

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the New Term Loan B Facility will be subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR, plus a margin which will be subject after a period of at least 12 months from the Closing Date to an
annual margin ratchet based on CGP’s Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. The initial margin under the
New Term Loan B Facility will be 5.50% per annum.

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of the New Term Loan B Facility
loans.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

A ticking fee will become payable in the event that the Closing Date occurs after the date falling 30 days after
allocation of the New Term Loan B Facility.

**_Repayments_**

The New Term Loan B Facility will be due for repayment in full on January 31, 2024.

In respect of a voluntary prepayment of the New Term Loan B Facility in accordance with the terms of the New
Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will also contain call protection
whereby lenders under the New Term Loan B Facility will benefit from (i) a prepayment fee of 3% of the principal
amount of the New Term Loan B Facility loan being prepaid if such voluntary prepayment is made on or before
the date falling 12 months after the Closing Date and (ii) a prepayment fee of 1% of the principal amount of the
New Term Loan B Facility loan being prepaid if such voluntary prepayment is made after the date falling 12
months after the Closing Date but on or prior to the date falling 24 months after the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, any voluntary prepayment occurring afterwards will be made at par.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will provide for voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to certain
_de minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:_

  - on a change of control (which will be defined in a manner substantially similar to that under the
Indenture); and

  - for each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year ending after the Closing Date), a
percentage of excess cash flow, dependent upon CGP’s Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio less
certain deductions and a de minimis amount.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

Subject to certain agreed security principles and the terms of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the New
Term Loan B Facility will benefit from guarantees and security from certain members of the Group incorporated
in France which are limited by reference to certain legal and tax issues.

On the date on which the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement will be executed, the New Term Loan B Facility
will be guaranteed by DCF, Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S. (together with CGP, the “New Term Loan B
**Facility Obligors”) and, on the date on which the new Term Loan B Facility Agreement will fund, will be secured**
by first ranking pledges over (i) the shares of Casino Participations France, DCF, Casino Finance, Monoprix

respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the
distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the relevant Security Agent until
the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, each Security Agent shall apply
distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds”
below.

Generally, to the extent that Liabilities of any member of the Group are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory
or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Group, any creditor
which benefited from that set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are

228


-----

discharged by that set-off to each Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out in the
caption “Application of Proceeds” below.

If a Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any of the liabilities owed to them by a member of the Group, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution
until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any member of the Group, each Creditor irrevocably
authorizes the applicable Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor

Agreement) against that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all liabilities of that member of the

Group;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all liabilities of that

member of the Group; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Common Security Agent or

Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (as applicable) considers reasonably necessary to recover the
liabilities of that member of the Group.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the relevant Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to
the matters disclosed under this section and (ii) if the relevant Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the
actions contemplated by this section or if the relevant Security Agent requests that a creditor take that action,
undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the relevant Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the relevant Security Agent on such terms as the relevant Security Agent may reasonably require,
(although no trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the relevant Security
Agent to take such action.

to the creditors in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Creditors”) in respect of the method,
type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Common

avoided or otherwise set aside in the context of insolvency proceedings or any similar event relating to the relevant
member of the Group who has granted the relevant Transaction Security or any other Debtor, (i) this amount will
be considered as not having been paid for the purposes of determining whether the Secured Liabilities have been

each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following

_accélérée and sauvegarde financière accélérée) proceedings)); or_

(ii) the Instructing Group or any Agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group

determines in good faith (and notifies each other Agent and the relevant Security Agent) that to enter
into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the relevant Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security.

Security Agent acting on behalf of the relevant Secured Parties as security for any obligations of the relevant
Debtor to the relevant creditors under any of the Debt Documents to which they are a party including any
obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement to pay back any Recoveries or any amounts to be turned over
pursuant to clawback on or prior to the Final Discharge Date. This pledge agreement shall include an irrevocable

or take any action in relation to that document or agreement in each case to the extent not prohibited by
the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement;

in each case provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not operate so as to override any provision in any
Debt Financing Agreement that expressly requires the consent of a particular group of Secured Creditors to effect
such release.

For the purpose of the above, in the case of a disposal of shares in a Debtor, or any other transaction pursuant to
which a Debtor will cease to be a member of the Group, the relevant Security Agent shall promptly release (or
procure that any other relevant person releases) that Debtor and its subsidiaries from all present and future
liabilities (both actual and contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents or any Second Lien Proceeds Loan and
the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or subsidiary)
from the Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document
and any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities under the Debt Documents).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the first paragraph of this
section, the Parent Company shall confirm in writing to the relevant Security Agent that:

without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor)
promptly enter into (or procure that any relevant person enters into) and deliver such documentation as the Parent
Company (acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release contemplated by the provisions described
in this section titled “Non-Distressed Disposals” (including the issuance of any certificates of non-crystallization

234


-----

of floating charges, any consent to dealing or any other similar or equivalent document that may be required or
desirable).

If requested by the Parent Company in accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements, the
relevant Security Agent and the other creditors shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor and/or the Parent Company)
promptly execute any guarantee, security or other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other
documentation relating to the relevant security documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt
Financing Agreements (and the relevant Security Agent is authorized to execute, and will promptly execute if
requested by the Parent Company, without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor, any such release or document on behalf of the creditors). The Parent Company
shall confirm in writing to the relevant Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Debt
Financing Agreement and the relevant Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes
under the Secured Debt Documents.

required or permitted under the Prior Ranking Financing Agreement(s) to apply the proceeds of any disposal or
other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any liabilities under such Prior
Ranking Financing Agreements:

(i) no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any Party or Second Lien Creditor or

will result in a direct or indirect breach of any Second Lien Finance Document; and

(ii) any such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment,

redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Second Lien Liabilities.

The paragraph above is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any
disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Second Lien
Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Prior Ranking Finance
Agreements.

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender or another Debtor over the assets of

company of the Issuer), and the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or
the relevant Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor
or holding company:

(A) (if the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (acting in accordance with the

Intercreditor Agreement) on the basis that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities
(the “Transferee”) will not be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant Creditors and
Debtors, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent does intend that any Transferee

will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor

accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (which is either the
Issuer or the subsidiary of the Issuer) (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s

obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group
liabilities or the relevant Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra
group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors

and

(B) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra

proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Senior Secured Notes Security
Agent (for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “Application of Proceeds” as if
those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Security and, to the extent that
any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred or any Appropriation has occurred, as if that disposal
of liabilities or Debtor liabilities, or any reduction in the Secured Obligations resulting from that Appropriation,
had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Common
Security Agent or the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (as the case may be), the Common Security Agent or
Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (as applicable) shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the
prevailing market conditions (although the Common Security Agent or Senior Secured Notes Security Agent (as
applicable) shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in
order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Common Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full following that release.

Subject to the below paragraph, in the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of Liabilities pursuant to the
paragraph (iv)(B) of the second paragraph above of this section “Distressed Disposals and Appropriations”)
effected by or at the request of the Common Security Agent (acting in accordance with paragraph falling two
paragraphs below) affecting the Shared Claims, unless the consent of each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal under the second
paragraph of this section “Distressed Disposals and Appropriations” above that:

- the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and/or other marketable securities; and

- all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors against the Shared Obligors (if any) are disposed of pursuant to
such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently
with such release, transfer or disposal (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
Security under the Transaction Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such release, transfer or
disposal, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge)
the relevant Instructing Group:

(A) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Senior Secured

Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged; and

(B) serve a written notice on the Common Security Agent confirming the same to

the Common Security Agent;

- in which cases the Common Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the
form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors bidding by an appropriate mechanic
for all or part of the Senior Secured Liabilities (such that the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion,
be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant Senior Secured
Creditors); and

238


-----

- such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured Creditors are

entitled to participate; or

(B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent (acting

on instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) has delivered an opinion in respect
of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount
of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Common Security
Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have
been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If, prior to the first date on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Second Lien Discharge
**Date”), a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities and/or Common Security**
will be released under the second paragraph above of this section “Distressed Disposals and Appropriations”, it
is a further condition to the release that either:

- the Second Lien Creditor Representatives have approved the release; or

- where shares or assets of a Second Lien Issuer/Borrower or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (a
“Second Lien Guarantor”) are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash)

and/or other marketable securities;

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and (if applicable) Second Lien

Creditors against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares are pledged in favor of
the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the Transaction
Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event
of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge) each Senior Agent and
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim was released or
discharged, and (ii) serve a notice on the Common Security Agent notifying the Common
Security Agent of the same; in which cases the Common Security Agent shall be entitled
immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser)
and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash consideration by
way of the Senior Secured Creditors bidding by an appropriate mechanic for all or part of the
Senior Secured Liabilities (such that the Senior Secured Liabilities would, on completion, be
discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant
Senior Secured Creditors); and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(1) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Secured

Creditors are entitled to participate; or

(2) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Common Security Agent

has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in
connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all
relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the
liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect
of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Common Security Agent shall
have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, “entitled to participate” shall be interpreted to mean that any
offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities
makes shall be considered by those running the public auction against the same criteria as any offer, or indication
of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder. If, after having applied those same criteria, the offer
or indication of a potential offer made by a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities is

239


-----

not considered by those running the public auction to be sufficient to continue in the public auction process, such
consideration being against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or
potential bidder (such continuation may include being invited to review additional information or being invited to
have an opportunity to make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise),
then the right to participate which a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities under the
Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied.

**_Equalization_**

_Equalization: Senior exposure_

Subject to certain other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for
any reason, any Senior Lender Liabilities and Hedging Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date and
the resulting losses are not borne by the Senior Finance Parties in the proportions which their respective exposures
at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior Finance Parties at the Enforcement Date,
the Senior Finance Parties (other than any Notes Trustee with respect to Notes Trustee Amounts) will make such

242


-----

payments amongst themselves as the Common Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Finance Parties in
such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

_Equalization: Shared Claims_

Subject to certain other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for
any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain unpaid after the Enforcement Date, and the resulting losses are
not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective exposures in relation to the
Shared Claims and excluding any Recoveries under any Transaction Security (the “Shared Claims Exposure”)
at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate Shared Claims Exposures of all the Senior Secured Creditors at the
Enforcement Date, the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Senior Secured Notes Trustee with respect to its
Senior Secured Notes Trustee Amounts) will make such payments amongst themselves as the Common Security
Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such
payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

_Equalization: Soulte payments_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, following a Relevant Security Enforcement
certain Secured Parties have not paid their share of the corresponding resulting Soulte (if any), such Secured
Parties will make such payments amongst themselves as the relevant Security Agent shall require to put the
Secured Parties in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) the amount paid or payable in
respect of such corresponding Soulte is borne by all the Secured Parties having participated in such Relevant
Security Enforcement in the proportions which their respective Exposures at the date of the Relevant Security
Enforcement bore to the aggregate Exposures of all such Secured Parties in whose favor the Transaction Security
that was the subject of the Relevant Security Enforcement was granted at the date of the Relevant Security
Enforcement.

_Additional Debt_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, for the
implementation of any existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement in respect of any of the
liabilities, including by way of refinancing, replacement, increase or otherwise of any such new, existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under such finance documents (each an “Additional Debt
**Financing”), in each case subject to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents.**

Subject to compliance with applicable provisions of the Secured Debt Documents each Party shall be required to
enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then current Secured Debt Documents (including for the
purpose of reflecting the terms and ranking of any Additional Debt Financing in the Secured Debt Documents)
and/or take such other action as is reasonably required by the Parent Company (in each case at the cost of the
Parent Company) in order to facilitate any Additional Debt Financing, including in relation to any changes to, the
taking of, or the release coupled with the retaking of, any guarantee or Security, provided that the relevant Security
Agent shall not be required to execute a release of assets from any existing Transaction Security pursuant to this
paragraph unless the Parent Company has confirmed in writing to the relevant Security Agent that it has
determined in good faith (taking into account any applicable legal limitations and other relevant considerations in
relation to the Additional Debt Financing) that it is not possible to implement the Additional Debt Financing by
either granting additional Transaction Security and/or amending the terms of the existing Transaction Security.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, no amendment or release and regrant of any Transaction Security granted by any French Debtor shall be required or permitted in order to
implement such Additional Debt Financing; instead, to the extent necessary to implement such Additional Debt
Financing, the relevant French Debtor shall grant second or lesser ranking security as described in the last
paragraph of this section. Each Agent and the relevant Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed by
each Party (other than the Debtors), each Secured Party and each Secured Creditor to execute any such amended
or replacement Secured Debt Documents and/or take such action on behalf of the Parties, the Secured Parties and
the Secured Creditors (and shall promptly do so on the request of and at the cost of the Parent Company). The
Security Agents shall incur no liability in acting in accordance with instructions received pursuant to the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described under this caption “Additional Debt”.

The provisions contained in this section shall not operate so as to override any provision in any Debt Financing
Agreement which would (i) require the unanimous consent of any of the Senior Lenders, Hedge Counterparties,
Senior Secured Noteholders, Second Lien Lenders or Second Lien Noteholders as applicable under the terms of
any of the Debt Financing Agreements or (ii) expressly require the consent of any individual affected class of
Secured Creditors or any individual affected Secured Creditor under the terms of any of the Debt Financing
Agreements.

243


-----

Without prejudice to the provisions captioned “Ranking and priority” and “Application of Proceeds”, upon any
Additional Debt Financing being confirmed at any time after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
amendment to the Secured Debt Documents resulting or expected to result in more onerous payment obligations
upon the relevant Debtors, the relevant Debtors may grant to the relevant Secured Parties additional security by
executing additional Security Documents on a second or lesser ranking basis which will nevertheless benefit from
the order of priority and ranking set out in the provisions captioned “Ranking and priority” and “Application of
_Proceeds”._

**_Changes to the Parties_**

_New Intra-Group Lender_

If any Intra-Group Lender or any member of the Group (other than the Parent Company) makes any loan to or
grants any credit to or makes any other financial arrangement having similar effect with any Debtor such that the
aggregate balance which is outstanding at the expiry of any calendar month (after netting of all the positions made
at the expiry of such calendar month) exceeds €50,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies), the Parent
Company will procure that the person giving that loan, granting that credit or making that other financial
arrangement (if not already a Party as an Intra-Group Lender) accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as an IntraGroup Lender, within ninety (90) days as from the date on which such threshold is reached at the expiry of any
calendar month.

Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Parent Company shall procure that certain companies
listed in a schedule to the Intercreditor Agreement shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement within ninety (90)
days as from the closing date under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement.

**_Required Consents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) if the relevant amendment or waiver (the “Proposed Amendment”) is prohibited by

the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and/or any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the relevant Senior Agent (acting on the instructions of
the requisite Senior Lenders);

(ii) if the Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Senior

Secured Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Secured Noteholders);

(iii) if any indebtedness has been incurred under a Second Lien Facility Agreement and the

Proposed Amendment is prohibited by the terms of the Second Lien Facility Agreement, the Second Lien
Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Second Lien Lenders in accordance with the Second
Lien Facility Agreement);

(iv) if any Second Lien Notes have been issued and the Proposed Amendment is prohibited

by the terms of the relevant Second Lien Notes Indenture, the Second Lien Notes Trustee (acting on
behalf of the Second Lien Noteholders);

(v) if a hedge counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement,

that hedge counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver adversely
affects the continuing rights and/or obligations of that hedge counterparty; and

(vi) the Parent Company.

To the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such amendment,
waiver or consent does not materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of the other classes of creditors,
only consent from the Agent acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Agents, each Security Agent and Parent Company without
the consent of any other party thereto, to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or
reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative nature or if that amendment or waiver is for the benefit of
all or any of the Secured Parties.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Security Agent may, if authorized
by an Instructing Group and if the Parent Company, in the case of the Common Security and the Senior Lender

244


-----

Liabilities Security, or the Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Security, consent to amend the terms
of, waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding
on each party, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall operate so as to override any provision in any Debt
Financing Agreement that would otherwise require the consent of a particular group of Secured Creditors to effect
such amendment, waiver or consent.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the case of any amendment or waiver of, or
consent under, any security document governing the Common Security or Senior Secured Notes Security which
would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in which the proceeds of
enforcement of the Common Security or Senior Secured Notes Security are distributed that amendment, waiver
or consent shall require approval in accordance with the provisions set out above under the caption “Required
_Consents”._

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below and certain other exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, an amendment,
waiver or consent which adversely relates to the express rights or obligations of an Agent, an arranger or a Security
Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that Agent, that arranger or that
Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

Neither of the preceding paragraph nor the first paragraph of the section above captioned “Amendments and
_Waivers: Security Documents” shall apply:_

- to any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities; or

- to any consent,

which, in each case, the relevant Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption
“Proceeds of Disposals” above.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything
in the Debt Documents to the contrary.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to
the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent, as creditor in its own right and not as representative of the other Secured
Parties, amounts equal to, and in the currency of, any amounts owing from time to time by that Debtor to any
Senior Secured Notes Creditor under any Primary Debt Document, as and when those amounts are due. Each
Debtor makes a similar undertaking to pay to the Common Security Agent amounts equal to those owing from
time to time by that Debtor to any Secured Party (other than any Senior Secured Notes Creditor).

The Intercreditor Agreement will include an acknowledgement from each Debtor and each Security Agent that
the obligations of each Debtor described in the paragraph above are several and are separate and independent
from, and shall not in any way limit or affect, the corresponding obligations of that Debtor to any other Secured
Party under any Primary Debt Document (its “Corresponding Debt”) nor shall the amounts for which each
Debtor is liable as described in the paragraph above (for the purposes of this paragraph, its “Parallel Debt”) be
limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt, provided that notwithstanding any other provision of
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Primary Debt Documents:

(i) the Parallel Debt of each Debtor shall be automatically decreased and discharged to the extent that its
Corresponding Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged;

(ii) the Corresponding Debt of each Debtor shall be automatically decreased and discharged to the extent that
its Parallel Debt has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged;

(iii) the amount of the Parallel Debt of a Debtor shall at all times be equal to the amount of its Corresponding
Debt; and

(iv) the aggregate amount outstanding owed by the Debtors under the Primary Debt Documents (including

**Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities**

CGP and Casino Finance are party to two unsecured syndicated credit facilities which will be partially repaid with
the proceeds of the Refinancing.

On February 28, 2014, CGP and Casino Finance entered into the Casino 2014 Syndicated Credit Facility, a €1.2
billion multi-currency revolving facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions acting as lenders and
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank (“CACIB”) acting as facility and swingline agent. The Casino
2014 Syndicated Credit Facility provides for revolving advances of up to an aggregate of €1.2 billion on a
committed basis. Borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. As amended, the Casino 2014
Syndicated Credit Facility may be utilized to and including the business day that is one month prior to the extended
maturity date, February 28, 2021.

On July 26, 2017, CGP and Casino Finance entered into the Casino 2017 Syndicated Credit Facility, a $750
million multi-currency revolving facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions acting as lenders and
J.P. Morgan Europe Limited acting as facility and swingline agent. The Casino 2017 Syndicated Credit Facility

used for general corporate purposes. The Casino 2017 Syndicated Credit Facility may be utilized to and including
the business day that is one month prior to the maturity date, July 26, 2022.

The Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities were undrawn as of June 30, 2019.

The requisite majority of lenders under each of the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities have consented
to the Refinancing. Certain consenting lenders will have their commitments cancelled and will simultaneously
become lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Certain consenting lenders who have not chosen to
become lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the lenders under the Casino Existing Syndicated
Credit Facilities who have not consented to the Refinancing will stay committed under the Casino Existing
Syndicated Credit Facilities until their respective maturities.

A description of the common provisions of the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities is below.

_Interest and Fees_

The rate of interest on revolving advances of loans under the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities is
calculated at a percentage per annum that is the sum of (1) an applicable margin that may be adjusted based on
CGP’s consolidated net financial debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio (calculated as provided for therein) and (2)
EURIBOR or LIBOR, as the case may be (or EONIA for swingline loans) subject, in the case of the Casino 2017
Syndicated Credit Facility, to an aggregate zero floor. The rate of interest is subject to increase by a certain
percentage for amounts that are overdue. Interest payments for each revolving advance are due at the end of the
term for the advance, which may be a term of one, three or six months (or no more than seven business days for
swingline loans), or any other period otherwise agreed to.

CGP is also generally required to pay certain other customary fees under the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit
Facilities, including commitment, utilization and other fees.

_Conditions to Drawdown_

Loans granted pursuant to utilization requests under the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities are subject
to certain customary conditions precedent, including confirmation that no default has occurred and is continuing
or would result from the proposed loan and the confirmation of certain customary representations and warranties
made in the respective agreements governing the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities.

_Repayments_

Each loan made under the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities must be repaid in full on the last day of
the term for the loan advance. If the end of a term falls after the maturity date, the loan must be repaid in full on
the maturity date. Amounts repaid may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

_Prepayments_

In addition to the scheduled repayment of principal, the Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities provide for
mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of a change of control of either CGP or Casino Finance. In the event
of a change of control of CGP, which is defined as a third party acting alone or in concert with other third parties
exclusively gaining control (as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the French Code de Commerce) of CGP, each lender,
upon the facility agent’s receipt of the required notice from CGP regarding the change of control, may request
that its commitments under the applicable facility be cancelled, with all amounts outstanding thereunder
subsequently becoming due and payable, together with accrued interest.

In the event of a change of control of Casino Finance, wherein a third party acting alone or in concert with other
third parties exclusively gains control of Casino Finance, each lender, upon the facility agent’s receipt of the
required notice from CGP regarding the change of control, may request that its commitments under the applicable
facility be cancelled, but solely with respect to its commitments in respect of Casino Finance, and may require
repayment of its share in outstanding amounts by Casino Finance only, with all amounts outstanding thereunder
subsequently becoming due and payable by Casino Finance, together with accrued interest. A change of control
of Casino Finance only will not give lenders the right to cancel their commitments with respect to CGP.

Indebtedness under the applicable Casino Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities may be voluntarily cancelled or
prepaid, upon providing the requisite notice, without penalty or premium (subject to applicable break costs), in
whole or in part, subject to certain conditions, including with respect to minimum amounts. Amounts prepaid may
be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions. Commitments cancelled may not be reinstated.

including covenants applicable to CGP and Casino Finance and, as the case may be, to CGP’s principal
subsidiaries, (defined as any subsidiary of CGP accounting for 10% or more of CGP’s consolidated total assets

time to maintain a consolidated net debt to EBITDA ratio (the ratio between (a) the sum of CGP’s most recent
consolidated non-current financial liabilities and current financial liabilities, less its cash and cash equivalents,
financial assets held for treasury management purposes and other similar investments, hedges of debt with a
positive fair value, financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets (and, solely with
respect to the Casino 2017 Syndicated Credit Facility, less assets held for sale net of related liabilities, attributable
to owners of CGP) and (b) in respect of each 12-month period ending on the last day of CGP’s financial year,
CGP’s most recent consolidated trading profit after adding back depreciation, amortization and provisions) at no
more than 3.5:1 at any time.

grace periods, thresholds, materiality and other exceptions), including payment default, failure to comply with the
financial covenant described above, failure to comply with any other obligation, misrepresentation, cross-default,
insolvency and insolvency proceedings concerning CGP, any of its principal subsidiaries, or Casino Finance,
winding-up, dissolution or reorganization, creditor enforcement proceedings or the enforceability of
encumbrances, failure to comply with a final judgment, change of business, unlawfulness and invalidity.

The occurrence of an event of default allows the agent to (and, if so directed by the majority lenders the agent
shall be required to) (i) declare all or any part of any borrowings thereunder to be immediately due and payable,
together with accrued interest and/or (ii) cancel the total commitments under the applicable Casino Existing
Syndicated Credit Facility.

To the extent an event of default occurs or is continuing with respect to Casino Finance only, CGP shall retain the
right to draw under the facility (including for the purpose of reimbursing any outstanding amounts borrowed by
Casino Finance), subject to certain terms and conditions. In the event of Casino Finance’s default, the agent shall
not be entitled to exercise the remedies described above with respect to any borrowings by CGP, provided that
Casino Finance’s default does not have a material adverse effect and Casino Finance’s outstanding borrowings
are equal to zero, or will become zero upon CGP’s reimbursement of such outstanding Casino Finance borrowings.

are from time to time mandatory under French law, equally and ratably with all of CGP’s other present or future
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, from time to time outstanding. None of the Existing EMTN Bonds are
guaranteed.

The Existing EMTN Bonds also contain negative pledge provisions, providing that so long as any bonds or, if
applicable, any coupons (and with respect to certain of the Existing EMTN Bonds, receipts relating to the notes)
remain outstanding, CGP agrees not to grant (and shall ensure that none of its principal subsidiaries will grant)
security interests (mortgage, charge, pledge, etc.) on any of its assets or revenues, present or future to secure
relevant indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by any of them, unless CGP’s obligations under the bonds, receipts
and coupons, as applicable, are equally and ratably secured therewith. Under the negative pledge provisions,
“relevant indebtedness” is defined as any indebtedness for borrowed money, represented by notes or other
securities which are or are capable of being quoted, listed and admitted to trading or ordinary dealt in on any stock
exchange, over-the-counter market or other securities market. Under the negative pledge provisions, “principal
subsidiary” means any subsidiary of CGP which at any time accounts for (a) 10% or more of the consolidated
total assets of CGP; or (b) 10% or more of the consolidated turnover of CGP, as calculated by reference to CGP’s
latest audited consolidated annual financial statements and the relevant subsidiary’s latest annual consolidated
audited or (if consolidated accounts are not prepared in relation to such subsidiary) unconsolidated annual audited
financial statements. For a description of the Issuer’s status under these negative pledge provisions, see
“Summary—The Issuer”.

The applicable terms and conditions governing the Existing EMTN Bonds include a change-of-control put option,
subject to certain conditions and limitations, that triggers bondholders’ option to require CGP to redeem or, at
CGP’s option, to procure the purchase of the bonds, at their principal amount, together with accrued interest, upon
the occurrence of a put event. A put event is defined as a change of control (defined as any person or persons
acting in concert (other than a permitted holding company acting alone or in concert, which includes Rallye)
coming to own or acquire such number of shares in the capital of CGP carrying more than 50% of the voting
rights exercisable at a general meeting of CGP), when (i) the notes are not rated or (ii) the notes have been
downgraded, by at least 1 notch, during a specific period, as a result of the change of control.

The applicable terms and conditions governing the Existing EMTN Bonds contain customary events of default
(subject in certain cases to grace periods, thresholds and other conditions) allowing a bondholder through the
representative to cause the bonds to become immediately due and payable at their principal amount, plus accrued
interest. Such events of default include payment default, failure to comply with obligations created by the Existing
EMTN Bonds, cross-default, insolvency and insolvency proceedings concerning CGP.

The terms and conditions for each of the series of the Existing EMTN Bonds are governed by French law.

**Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes**

**_2005 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes_**

On January 20, 2005 and February 15, 2005, CGP issued €500 million and €100 million, respectively, of its deeply
subordinated fixed to CMS floating rate notes (together, the “2005 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes”).
These notes have no final maturity. The notes initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% per annum until January
20, 2008. The interest rate has since been reset at a floating rate per annum of 1% above the 10-year Constant
Maturity Swap, subject to a cap of 9%, payable quarterly on January 20, April 20, July 20 and October 20 of each
year. Quarterly interest payment dates will be either compulsory interest payment dates (if at any time during a
12-month period prior to such interest payment date (i) CGP has declared or paid a dividend or made a payment
of any nature in respect of certain equity securities or (ii) CGP has redeemed, repurchased repaid or otherwise
acquired, or any of its subsidiaries has purchased or otherwise acquired, certain equity securities) or optional
payment dates (any interest payment date that is not compulsory). If payment of interest on an interest payment
date is optional, CGP, upon providing notice to holders of the notes, may choose not to pay interest that is due.
Any interest not paid on an optional interest payment date shall be forfeited and will no longer be due and payable
by CGP. The 2005 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes do contain a change of control provision.

**_2013 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes_**

On October 24, 2013, CGP issued €750 million of its deeply subordinated fixed to reset rate notes (the “2013
**Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes”). These notes have no final maturity. The notes initially bore interest at**
a fixed rate of 4.870% per annum until January 31, 2019. The interest rate has since been reset at a rate per annum
equal to the relevant five-year swap rate and an applicable margin, adjustable at each five-year reset date and
payable on January 31 of each year. The current interest rate is 3.992%. CGP may defer interest payments on the
notes in whole (but not in part) at its election upon providing notice to holders of the notes. Such interest payments
will be deferred and will constitute arrears of interest, payable at CGP’s option at any time, subject to certain
limitations (including any dividend payments made by CGP).

The applicable terms and conditions governing the 2013 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes include a changeof-control call option, subject to certain conditions and limitations, that triggers CGP’s option to redeem or procure
the purchase of the notes, together with accrued interest upon the occurrence of a call event. A call event is defined
as a change of control (defined as any person or persons acting in concert (other than a permitted holding company
acting alone or in concert) coming to own or acquire such number of the shares in the capital of CGP carrying
more than 50% of the voting rights normally exercisable at a general meeting of CGP ), when (i) CGP’s longterm credit is not rated or (ii) CGP’s long-term credit has been downgraded during a specified period as a result
of the change of control.

_Common Provisions_

The 2005 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes and 2013 Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes (together, the
“Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes”) are each of CGP’s direct, unconditional, unsecured and
deeply subordinated obligations and rank and will rank pari passu among themselves and pari passu with all other
present or future deeply subordinated obligations, but will be subordinated to the titres participatifs issued by, and
the _prêts participatifs granted to CGP, to ordinary subordinated obligations (defined as any obligations which_
constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated obligations of CGP and rank _pari passu among_
themselves and with all other present or future ordinary subordinated obligations, but in priority to the _prêts_
_participatifs_ granted to, or the _titres participatifs_ issued by CGP and deeply subordinated obligations) and to
unsubordinated obligations of or issued by CGP. The Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes do not restrict
CGP’s ability to grant security interests on any of its assets.

The Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes have no specified maturity date. CGP may redeem the notes
at its option on specified redemption dates for tax reasons, and with respect to the 2013 Deeply Subordinated
Perpetual Notes, following a specified change in accounting principles related to the IFRS recognition of the notes,
following a change in the equity credit rating criteria of a rating agency which results in lower equity credit for
the notes and following a change of control call event, subject to applicable terms and conditions.

The applicable terms and conditions of the Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes do not contain events
of default or cross-default provisions. However, the notes shall become due and payable in full, together with
accrued interest, if a competent court declares CGP’s judicial liquidation, in the event of a transfer of the whole
of CGP’s business subsequent to the opening of a judicial recovery procedure or CGP is liquidated for any other
reason.

The terms and conditions of the Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes are governed by the laws of France.

**Commercial Paper Program**

To meet its short-term finance needs, CGP has from time to time issued commercial paper under its European
commercial paper program. The program provides for the issuance of short-term, unsecured and unguaranteed
borrowings with maturities of up to one year. CGP’s commercial paper program is not subject to any financial
covenants. As of June 30, 2019, €167 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.

**Latam Retail Indebtedness**

As of June 30, 2019, GPA and Grupo Éxito had an aggregate total of €2,510 million of outstanding financial
indebtedness, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and IFRS 5 on assets and liabilities, and excluding the Segisor
Credit Facility.

GPA’s outstanding indebtedness includes borrowings under debentures, foreign currency loans and credit lines.
From time to time, GPA issues unsecured debentures to strengthen its working capital, maintain its cash strategy,
lengthen its debt profile and make investments. As of June 30, 2019, €1,436 million was outstanding under GPA’s
debenture program, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and IFRS 5 on assets and liabilities, and excluding the
Segisor Credit Facility.

Sendas, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBD, announced on August 9, 2019 that it was issuing BRL 8.0 billion (or
€1,803 million based on the intraday average mid-market EUR/BRL exchange rate on October 28, 2019) in
aggregate principal amount of unsecured debentures guaranteed by CBD, with maturity dates ranging from one
to four years from the date of issuance. The proceeds from the issuance will be used, together with cash on hand
at GPA, to finance the acquisition of Almacenes Éxito’s shares pursuant to the tender offer launched in connection
with the Latam Reorganization Transactions.

Grupo Éxito’s outstanding indebtedness includes short- and long-term borrowings through credit facilities with
fixed or floating interest rates which range in maturity from August 2020 through August 2025. These facilities
include revolving bilateral and syndicated facilities as well as short-term and mid-term bilateral facilities with
aggregate principal amounts ranging from €26 million to €555 million.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Quatrim S.A.S., a _société par actions simplifiée_ organized under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), will issue
€800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) under an indenture
to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), among, inter alios, the Issuer, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A.
(the “Parent Company”), the Initial Guarantors, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and
security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The term “Notes” refers also to Book-Entry Interests in the Notes.
Except as set forth herein, the terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.

The definitions of certain terms used in this description are set forth under the subheading “—Certain Definitions”.
Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the
meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. In this “Description of the Notes,” references to (i) the “Parent
_Company” refer only to Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) the “Issuer” refer_
only to Quatrim S.A.S. and not to any of its Subsidiaries; and (iii) “we,” “our,” “us” refer to the Parent Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will not be qualified under, and will not be subject to or incorporate provisions of, by reference or
otherwise, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”). Consequently, the holders of the Notes
generally will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under
a qualified indenture, including those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest
and to inform the holders of the Notes of certain relationships between it and the Issuer or the Guarantors. The
Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Security” as well as the Escrow Account Charge
define the terms of the security that will secure the Notes.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Account Charge and certain
other agreements relating to the Notes. It does not, however, restate any of those agreements in their entirety. You
should read the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement
and the Escrow Account Charge because they, and not this description, define your rights as a holder of the Notes.
Copies of the Indenture, the form of the Global Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents, the
Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account Charge may be obtained upon request from the Issuer and the Listing
Agent as set forth below under “Listing and General Information”.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

The Offering is expected to be consummated on the Issue Date, which may be prior to the date of the execution
of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion. If the Offering is
consummated prior thereto, pending the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an
aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the
Initial Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the Offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the
gross proceeds of the Offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to an escrow
agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Trustee and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London Branch, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the escrowed
proceeds are not released on or prior to December 20, 2019 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but excluding,
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”. If the
Offering closes concurrently with or after the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an
aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion, the foregoing escrow procedures will not apply, and the Initial
Purchasers will transfer the net proceeds of the Offering in accordance with the instructions provided by the Issuer
on the Issue Date.

**Listing of the Notes**

The Issuer has applied for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market thereof. See “—Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar
_and Transfer Agent for the Notes”._

256


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €800.0 million in this offering. The Notes will
mature on January 15, 2024, at which time 100% of the principal amount of Notes shall be payable, unless
redeemed prior thereto as described herein.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €800.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. The Issuer may, subject to applicable law and the Indenture, issue
an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”). The Issuer will only be permitted to
issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants
restricting the incurrence of Debt and the incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Debt” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens”)._

Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes, as applicable, except in respect
of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date or
dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or
the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to
whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions
upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional
Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, for
all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” shall be deemed to
include the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.875% _per annum computed against the principal amount_
outstanding on the Notes. Interest on the Notes will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2020, to holders of record on the Business Day immediately
preceding the relevant interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Notes will
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end
on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

257


-----

**The Proceeds Loans**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and each of the following Subsidiaries of the Parent
Company, as borrower (a “Proceeds Loan Borrower”), will enter into proceeds loan agreements pursuant to which
the Issuer will loan to each such Proceeds Loan Borrower on the Issue Date or the date of the Release, as
applicable, the following respective estimated amounts from the gross proceeds from the issuance of the Notes
(each a “Proceeds Loan” and collectively the “Proceeds Loans”):

**Estimated Amount of Proceeds Loan from**

**Proceeds Loan Borrower** **Notes proceeds (€ in millions)**

Distribution Casino France S.A.S. €164.0

Casino Finance S.A. €287.0

Monoprix S.A.S. €205.0

Segisor S.A.S. €39.0

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Proceeds Loan between the Issuer and Segisor will be entered into no later
than the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Latam Reorganization Completion Date and (ii) March 31, 2020.

Each Proceeds Loan will be denominated in euro. Each Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to
the interest rate of the Notes. Interest on each Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrears with
sufficient time in advance to permit the Issuer to make payments of interest on the Notes. The maturity date of
each Proceeds Loan will be the same maturity date as the maturity date of the Notes. Each Proceeds Loan will be
an unsecured obligation of the relevant Proceeds Loan Borrower.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under each Proceeds Loan will be made without deductions or
withholding for, or on account of, any applicable Tax. In the event that the relevant Proceeds Loan Borrower is
required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that
the Issuer receives and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made.

The Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loans will be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes, as described under the caption “—Security”.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

- will be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of the Issuer that is not subordinated
in right of payment to the Notes;

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes;

- will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which guarantees are subject to the guarantee limitations described
herein;

- will be secured by senior Liens over the Collateral as described below under “—Security”;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of the Issuer that is secured by property or
assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt;
and

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Parent Company’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

- will be a general senior unsecured obligation of that Guarantor;

- will be _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

258


-----

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is subordinated in right
of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt,
including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B Facility;

- will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of that Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors;
and

- will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including limitations under corporate
benefit laws, limiting, in the case of the guarantees of Distribution Casino France S.A.S., Casino Finance,
Monoprix S.A.S. and Segisor the value of such guarantees to the amount of proceeds of the Notes on-lent and
not repaid to such guarantors with the proceeds of the Offering.

Assuming we had completed the Transactions and applied the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of
_Proceeds,” as of June 30, 2019, the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had total gross_
debt of €8,718 million (before IFRS 5 impact). The Indenture will permit the Parent Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to Incur additional Debt in the future.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are holding companies and as such do not generate any meaningful EBITDA. As
at December 31, 2018 the Issuer and the Guarantors held 50.8% of our consolidated total assets.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of
the Indenture, except that all members of the Latam Group will be Unrestricted Subsidiaries (excluding (i) Segisor
and all of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (other than CBD and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries) and (ii)
Tevir and all of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (other than Almacenes Éxito and its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries) which will also be Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As of the Latam Reorganization
Completion Date, the members of the Latam Group will no longer be Subsidiaries of the Parent Company. For
the avoidance of doubt, Segisor and Tevir and all of their respective direct and indirect Subsidiaries will remain
Restricted Subsidiaries for purposes of the Indenture. In addition, under the circumstances described below under
the caption “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries,” the Parent
Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer Holdco, the Issuer and
any of their respective Subsidiaries) as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent
Company will not be subject to any of the provisions of the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes for so long as the
Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more transfer agents (each,
a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The initial transfer agent will
be Citibank, N.A., London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive
Registered Notes outstanding from time to time (the “Register”) and the Paying Agent will make payments on
and the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes on the behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without prior notice to the holders
of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market thereof and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or,
to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, post such notice on the official website
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

No service charge will be made for any registration of a transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but the
Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable
in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange (but not for a redemption).

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued on the Issue Date only in fully registered form without coupons and only in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act (“Rule 144A”) will initially be represented by a Global Note in registered form without interest coupons

259


-----

attached (the “144A Global Note”). The 144A Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream. Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by a Global Note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global
_Note” and, together with the 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will be_
deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Global Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the Indenture. Ownership of interests in the Global
Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or
Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and
transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below
and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants. Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”)
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor to the Registrar of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If definitive notes in registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) are issued, they will be issued only in
minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon
receipt by the Paying Agent or the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have
a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, furnish certain
certificates and opinions, and pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer
or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Notes:

(a) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(b) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(c) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(d) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer, Excess Proceeds Offer, Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer or Notes Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described under
“Transfer Restrictions”.

260


-----

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or payments made by any of
the Guarantors under or with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes
is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or
on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein; or

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
(including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Notes) or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”);

will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with
respect to the Notes or payments made by any of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Note Guarantee,
including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of the Notes after
such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such
Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received by the holder in respect of
such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts
will be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the holder of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner
of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is
an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a resident, citizen or national of such
jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business there or having or having
had a permanent establishment therein for Tax purposes), but excluding any connection arising solely
from the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee or
the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment
(where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes, or excise taxes imposed
on the transfer of Notes;

(d) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the
Notes or payments under or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(e) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or
beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuer’s written request addressed to the holder or beneficial
owner (and made at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction at a time that would enable
the holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request), to provide information
concerning the nationality, residency or identity of such holder or beneficial owner of the Notes or to
comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether
required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not
resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is
legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or Guarantor to the holder if such
holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment
to the extent that no Additional Amounts would have been payable had such holder been the sole
beneficial owner of such Note;

261


-----

(g) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or
official interpretations thereof and any agreements (including any law implementing any such agreement
or any intergovernmental agreements) entered into pursuant thereto; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holders of the Notes
for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto)
which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, enforcement or
registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein
(other than a transfer of Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments
with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect
thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (c) or (e)
through (g) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, each of the Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) on a date
that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 30 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the
Trustee and the Paying Agent promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other
information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the
relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof
that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions required by
law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority
in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain
Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a
Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not
obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably
requested by the Trustee or the Paying Agent, the Issuer or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee or the Paying
Agent such information as may be in the possession of the Issuer or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the
possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of withholding taxes
attributable to any particular holder; _provided, however, that in no event shall the Issuer or the Guarantors be_
required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Trustee be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular
holder.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment
of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes, of principal, redemption or purchase prices in
connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes, of interest or of any other amount payable under, or with
respect to, any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture or any transfer by a
holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, _mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any_
successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident
for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any
Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed as of the Issue Date by the Initial Guarantors. Subsequently, the Notes will
be guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors, Casino Finance and Segisor. We expect to implement (i) the Note
Guarantees of the Initial Guarantors on the Issue Date, (ii) the Note Guarantee of Segisor no later than the earlier

262


-----

of (x) 30 days after the Latam Reorganization Completion Date and (y) March 31, 2020 at the same time as Segisor
becomes a guarantor of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B Facility and (iii) the Note
Guarantee of Casino Finance no later than December 31, 2019. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several
obligations of the Guarantors.

As described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted
Subsidiary of the Parent Company that guarantees the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B
Facility or other indebtedness of the Parent Company shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor
of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security after the Issue Date in favor of
obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees or
security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference or thin capitalization laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction which limit the ability of the Issuer or a Guarantor to provide a guarantee or security or may require
that the guarantee or security interest granted be limited by an amount or otherwise, as described below under “—
_Security—General”._

Each of the Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be contractually limited to the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise
ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating to
capital maintenance, corporate benefit and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or any security interest granted by such Guarantor, as applicable,
could be significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Other debt of such Guarantor may not be
similarly limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the
_Note Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Note Guarantees may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees” and_ “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests”._

The Issuer is an existing special purpose vehicle with no business activity which will solely be used for the purpose
of issuing the Notes and any Additional Notes permitted to be issued under the Indenture. The Issuer wholly owns
the Real Estate Company, its only subsidiary.

The Parent Company is a holding company. The Parent Company conducts most of its operations through its
Subsidiaries. The Issuer depends on the cash flow of the Parent Company and its Subsidiaries (including the Real
Estate Company) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. Not all of the Parent
Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment
to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Parent
Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of the
Parent Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization
(and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated
to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is
itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such
Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any security in the
assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note
_Guarantees and the Note Collateral—The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations_
_of its own and will depend on distributions and cash received from IGC and directly or indirectly from other_
_operating companies of our Group to be able to make payments on the Notes” and “—The Notes and the Note_
_Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Note Guarantor subsidiaries”._

**_Release of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be automatically released:

(a) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (other than the Parent Company and the Issuer Holdco), including by way of merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or combination, to a Person that is not (either immediately before or
immediately after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if
the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales” below;_

263


-----

(b) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any parent
of that Guarantor (in each case other than the Parent Company and the Issuer Holdco), to a Person that
is not (either immediately before or immediately after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales” below and
the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(c) with respect to the Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that was required to provide such Note Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,”
upon such Guarantor being unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the
Debt giving rise to the requirement to provide such Note Guarantee so long as no other Debt guaranteed
by the relevant Guarantor would result in the requirement that such Guarantor provide a Note Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”
immediately after the release of such Note Guarantee;

(d) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes;

(e) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(f) (i) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or (ii) in connection with a Permitted_
Reorganization;

(g) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(h) upon the sale of all the Capital Stock of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, that Guarantor or any
direct or indirect parent of that Guarantor pursuant to a security enforcement sale in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(i) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; and

(j) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of customary
protections and indemnifications, will execute any documents reasonably requested in order to evidence or effect
such release, discharge and termination in respect of such guarantee. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be
required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Offering is consummated prior to the date of the execution of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement
with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will procure that the gross proceeds of the
Offering be deposited into the Escrow Account on the Issue Date. The Issuer will assign and charge its beneficial
and any other right to and interest in the Escrowed Property to the Trustee for the benefit of itself and the benefit
of the holders of the Notes as secured parties under an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the
Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Account Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account and
any additional amounts deposited pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and the proceeds (including income) of any
such deposits, less any amounts released pursuant to the terms thereof shall constitute, and are referred to,
collectively, as the “Escrowed Property”.

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property held in the Escrow Account to the Issuer
(the “Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or
before the Escrow Longstop Date, a certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall rely
conclusively, without further investigation, to the effect that:

  - the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion has been
executed or will be executed on the date of the Release, on substantially the same terms as described in
the Offering Memorandum under the section “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The
_New Revolving Credit Facility”, except for any waivers, changes or other modifications that will not,_
individually or when taken as a whole, have a materially adverse effect on the holders of the Notes or to
which the holders of the Notes have consented; and

264


-----

  - as of the date of the certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default under clause (1)(h) under the
heading captioned “—Events of Default” below.

The Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above. Upon the Release, the
balance on the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero and the Escrowed Property shall be released in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the date of the Release does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) at
any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, the Issuer notifies the Trustee and the Escrow Agent that, in its good
faith judgment, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least €1.8 billion will
not be executed on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (c) an Event of Default under clause (1)(h) under the
heading captioned “—Events of Default” below occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (any such event
being a “Special Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price_
of the Notes, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but
excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Mandatory Redemption Event, to the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than five Business Days after
such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”)._

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required to fund any additional amount due,
including but not limited to, the accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date
to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, owing to the holders of the Notes.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Trustee and the benefit of the holders of the Notes a security interest over the Escrow Account.
Receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the
Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Account Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such
Special Mandatory Redemption.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be secured on a senior basis by (a) the Escrow
Account Charge (until the Release) (if applicable) and (b) the Collateral.

As of the Issue Date, the Collateral is expected to include the following properties and assets of the Issuer:

- the financial securities account to which the shares of the Real Estate Company owned by the Issuer are
credited, constituting all of the outstanding shares of the Real Estate Company;

- all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loans made available by the Issuer to
Distribution Casino France S.A.S., Casino Finance and Monoprix S.A.S.;

- the bank accounts of the Issuer in France; and

- the Bond Segregated Accounts.

By no later than the date on which Segisor becomes a guarantor of the Notes, the Collateral is also expected to
include all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loan made available by the Issuer to
Segisor.

The assets and property of the Issuer that are from time to time subject to, or required to be subject to, a Lien
pursuant to the Security Documents are referred to as the “Collateral” (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes
the Escrow Account Charge). The security and other agreements in respect of the Collateral are referred to as the
“Security Documents”.

265


-----

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law, including laws relating to
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, or other
restrictions applicable to security providers, including laws relating to capital maintenance, corporate benefit and
the liability of directors and officers.

Under the Indenture, the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to Incur certain
additional Debt in the future that may share in the Collateral. The amount of such additional Debt will be limited
by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Debt that may share_
in the Collateral could be significant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Issue Date, certain assets may not be secured or such security may not
be created or perfected in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including:

- if providing such security would be reasonably expected to result in any breach of corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference or thin capitalization laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any
applicable jurisdiction;

- if providing such security would be reasonably expected to result in a demonstrable risk to the officers of the
relevant grantor of security of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability;
_provided that the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall use reasonable endeavors to_
overcome any such obstacle;

- if providing such security would be reasonably expected to result in costs that, in the reasonable opinion of
the Parent Company, are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that security;

- if providing such security would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct its operation and business in the ordinary
course or materially prejudice any commercial relationships of such parties; or

- if any assets are subject to pre-existing third party arrangements permitted by the Indenture which prevent
those assets from being charged; provided, however, that the Parent Company shall use reasonable endeavors
to obtain any necessary consent or release which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not require the Parent
Company to take any action which could reasonably be expected to damage its commercial relationship with
the relevant third party or to pay any significant fees to such third party.

The Agreed Security Principles will apply only with respect to security granted after the Issue Date and will also
include, inter alia, the principles described in the paragraphs below.

Any security shall, to the extent possible under local law, be enforceable on the occurrence of an enforcement
event. Unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the Issuer or a
Guarantor or under English law, all security shall be governed by the law of and cover assets located in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer or such Guarantor (other than security over securities issued by
Significant Subsidiaries which shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such
Significant Subsidiaries whose securities are subject to security, and not by the law of the jurisdiction of
incorporation of the Issuer or such Guarantor granting the security).

No security shall be taken over the following assets: (i) receivables other than intercompany loan receivables, (ii)
moveable plant or equipment or going concerns, (iii) intellectual property rights, (iv) real estate, including interests
under leases, and (v) any stock in trade; provided that this limitation shall not apply where the Parent Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has granted security over any such assets in favor of a third party and is
required by the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” to grant
equal and ratable security over such assets in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Collateral, will where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as
those already secured. No notice of any security shall be required to be given unless required by local law or
market practice for the perfection, validity or enforceability of the security. Where such notice is required to be
served by the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which is granting the security, the notice shall
be served on the relevant counterparty within five Business Days (or sooner, if required by local law or market
practice) of the security being granted.

The maximum guaranteed or secured amount shall be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration
or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit to the Trustee, the Security Agent and the holders of
the Notes increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is materially disproportionate to the level of such fees,
taxes and duties. The perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Issuer or a Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as

266


-----

otherwise permitted by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents.

If the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries required to grant security pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture (the “Future Security”) is incorporated in the same jurisdiction (the “Relevant Jurisdiction”) as the
Issuer which has granted security on or prior to the Issue Date (the “Initial Security”), the Future Security shall be
based on the existing Security Document in respect of the same class of assets owned by it as such Initial Security
(updated as appropriate, including as required by law or local market practice). If the Parent Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary is not incorporated in a Relevant Jurisdiction, the main provisions (secured obligations,
enforcement event, use of pledged assets, blockage of voting rights or dividends) of the Security Documents to
be entered into by it will be based on the Security Document pursuant to which the Initial Security was created in
other jurisdictions, to the extent permitted under applicable laws.

Each Security Document shall provide that if there is a conflict between the Security Document and the Indenture
and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) then (to the extent
permitted by law) the provisions of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) shall take priority over the provisions of the Security Document.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied reasonably and in good
faith by the Issuer.

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged by the Issuer to secure the payment when due of
the Issuer’s payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into
by, inter alios, the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes.

Due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests in France, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent,
and the security interests in that jurisdiction will secure the parallel debt (and not the Debt under the Notes and
the other secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in that jurisdiction.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Note Collateral—
_The security over the Note Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes”._

Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized and instructed the Trustee
to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) to be bound thereby. Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the
Security Agent as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and authorizes it to act
as such.

The holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore holders may not, individually
or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The
holders may only act through the Trustee or the Security Agent (as creditor of the parallel debt), as applicable.
The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents (the
“Security Interests”) that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring
any consent of the holders. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement
action under the Security Documents in accordance with the Indenture and the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement of
_Security”._

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer will
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely
operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that
are part of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all
cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock
splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to
the foregoing).

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the
issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the
Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Note
_Collateral—The Note Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes, the Notes being_
_secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been and will be granted as security for the Notes”._

267


-----

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with this Offering.
There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be
sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the Notes. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be
sold in a timely manner or at all. In addition, the value of any Collateral in the form of Capital Stock may be worth
less than the value of the assets of the entities the Capital Stock of which is pledged. Furthermore, the value of the
Collateral may be assigned a lower value than its Fair Market Value in the case of insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings in France.

The Security Documents will be governed by the laws of France and provide that the rights with respect to the
Notes and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the entire outstanding amount
of the Notes. The term “Security Interests” refers to the Liens on the Collateral.

The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each of its Subsidiaries, shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such
acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering any Security
Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended
to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement,
for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver
of all or any part of the Collateral. The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each of its Subsidiaries, shall execute
such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its
nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.

**_Release of the Security_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens securing the Notes under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or
assets constituting Collateral to a Person that is not (either immediately before or immediately after
giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sale of Certain Assets—Specific Perimeter Asset Sales” below;_

(b) upon a release of the Lien (the “Initial Lien”) that resulted in the creation of the Lien (the “Notes Lien”)
under the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” so
long as immediately after the release of the Notes Lien there is no other Debt secured by a Lien on the
property and assets that were the subject of the Initial Lien and Notes Lien that would result in the
requirement for the Notes to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

(c) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes;

(d) in accordance with the caption entitled “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(e) (i) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under the caption entitled “—Certain
_Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or (ii) in connection with a Permitted_
Reorganization;

(f) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(g) in the case of a security enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the release of the property and assets subject to such enforcement
sale;

(h) in respect of a release followed by an immediate retaking in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(i) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Escrow Account Charge will be released automatically in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and the Escrow Account Charge.

268


-----

Following written request by the Issuer, the Security Agent and, if necessary, the Trustee will take all necessary
action required to effect any release of Collateral securing the Notes, in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
holders of the Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless required).

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the terms of the Indenture nor the terms of the Security Documents governing
the Collateral shall prevent (i) any buy-back of shares of the Real Estate Company, any reduction of its share
capital or any cancellation of its shares (in each case effected by the Issuer) and (ii) the performance of any step,
action or corporate reorganization required to be taken or taken in order to complete any step or action which is
part of any Permitted Specific Perimeter Reorganization, and, in the event of clauses (i) and (ii), shall not require
the consent of the holders of the Notes or the authorization of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Tax Redemption”, the Notes are not redeemable until
November 15, 2021. On and after November 15, 2021 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes, at the following redemption
prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on November 15 of the years indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2021 ...................................................................................................................................................................................... 102.9375%

2022 ...................................................................................................................................................................................... 101.46875%

2023 and thereafter ............................................................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Prior to November 15, 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem Notes in a total aggregate
principal amount not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the
principal amount of any Additional Notes), in each case, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to
holders of the Notes, with funds in an aggregate amount (the “Redemption Amount”) not exceeding the net cash
proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 105.875% of the principal amount of the Notes
so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any
Additional Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time and from time to time prior to November 15, 2021, the Issuer may redeem during each twelve-month
period commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including the principal amount of any Additional Notes), at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice to holders of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the
Notes redeemed, _plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the_
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, prior to November 15, 2021, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes _plus the Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and_
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. If the Issuer effects an
optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market thereof, inform the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain
outstanding immediately after such redemption.

Any redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent
(including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering).

269


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of the Notes, including a Change
of Control Offer, an Excess Proceeds Offer, a Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer or a Notes Offer, if
holders of the Notes holding not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of any series of outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders of the Notes of such series will be deemed to have consented
to such tender offer and, accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to holders of the Notes, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer
expiration date, to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following
such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder (excluding any early tender or incentive
fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except pursuant to “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”, the Issuer is not otherwise required
to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as described under the captions “—
_Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control” and “—Certain_ _Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets”._
The Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market
or otherwise.

**Tax Redemption**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at the Issuer’s discretion at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and Notice”), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject
to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would
be payable under or in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes
or any of the Guarantors with under or respect to any Note Guarantee, as the case may be, is or would be required
to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount cannot be paid by the
Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and
the Issuer or Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures
available (including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction), and the requirement
arises as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly announced
as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable
Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or

(b) any amendment to, or change in, any existing official written interpretation or application of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change has not been
publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date
(or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later
date) (each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in
respect of the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such
notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice
of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably

270


-----

withheld)) to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, is required to pay such Additional Amounts
as a result of a Change in Tax Law. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the
Notes as described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its
obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and that it is entitled to redeem
such Notes pursuant to their terms.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such Guarantor has become obligated to make
at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring on or after the date on which
such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to
each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof) of such holder’s Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”) in cash in
an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, _plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase Date”) (subject to
the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to the Change of Control Purchase
Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will
also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Indenture.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes in accordance with the Indenture
and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of
Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise
deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice,” stating that a Change
of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the
notice will state:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the Notes on the
date specified in the notice;

(b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or transactions
that constitute a Change of Control;

(c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business
Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date
as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws
or regulations;

(d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest
after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid;

(e) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and

(f) any other procedures that a holder of the Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to
withdraw such acceptance.

An agent of the Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the Issuer promptly mail
(or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for
such Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or
cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of the Notes in global form or to each holder of
certificated Notes; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as
soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number
of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could trigger a
mandatory repayment and cancellation of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan
B Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities or other Credit Facilities may not constitute

271


-----

a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Parent Company’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness
of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover,
the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control
could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible
financial effect of such repurchase on the Parent Company and its Subsidiaries.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have available funds
sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the
Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of
Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of
Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default”.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of the Parent Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Parent Company and the initial
purchasers of the Notes. The Parent Company has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a
Change of Control, although it is possible that the Parent Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to
limitations discussed below, the Parent Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Parent
Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Parent Company’s ability to Incur additional
Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—
_Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal_
amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”).
Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of the Indenture will not require
the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other
transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect
holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control
Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture
applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the
Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in
payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable
whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Any such transaction, however, would have
to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control”, “Permitted Holder” and “Successor Parent” expressly permit
certain third parties to obtain control of the Parent Company without any obligation to make a Change of Control
Offer in any transaction which would require the making of such Change of Control Offer if it involved a person
other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Successor Parent. For instance, if Rallye S.A., the Parent
Company’s controlling shareholder on the Issue Date, were to have, directly or indirectly, a new controlling
shareholder, such event would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following:

(a) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger
or consolidation or other similar business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to any Person other than the Parent Company, a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more
Permitted Holders; or

272


-----

(b) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation or other
similar business combination transaction) the result of which is that any “person” (as that term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date) other than one or more
Permitted Holders, becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the
Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock
of the Parent Company, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; provided that, for the
purposes of this clause, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the Parent Company
becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes if made prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property
or assets of a Person.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the Notes
for redemption in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, or by a
method that complies with the requirements, as certified to the Paying Agent and the Registrar by the Issuer, of
the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed at such time or, if Euroclear or Clearstream
prescribe no method or the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange, pro rata; provided, however, that no such
partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a Note not redeemed to less than €100,000.
No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. While the Notes are held in certificated form, a new
Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the
holder of the Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes
redeemed.

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption
date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be
mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be
given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account
holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market of that exchange and the rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes
shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules and regulations, posted on the_
[official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption,](http://www.bourse.lu/)
the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

**Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes attain an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating
Agencies and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (a “Suspension
_Event”), beginning on the day of the Suspension Event and continuing until such time (the “Suspension Period”),_
if any, at which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Rating from each Rating Agency (the “Reversion
_Date”), (whereupon the Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in writing that the_
Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating), the covenants summarized under the following captions will

273


-----

not apply to the Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not
be applicable to the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt;”

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;”

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales;”

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees;”

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
_Subsidiaries;”_

(7) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (but only clause (c) of the first and
second paragraphs of such covenant).

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms on and after the
Reversion Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Parent Company
or the Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the Suspension Period, and the “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the Issue Date,_
except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made during the
Suspension Period. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Period
will be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to clause (2)(e) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Debt”. Any transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an_
agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (c) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with
_Affiliates”. Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described_
in clauses (a) through (d) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”_ that becomes effective during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (2)(c) of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”._
Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the Issuer will promptly deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
notifying it of each occurrence hereunder. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall
not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify holders of the
Notes if the Notes achieve an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Rating Agencies or upon the occurrence
of a Suspension Event or a Reversion Date.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Parent Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly, create, issue, incur, assume, guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable
with respect to or otherwise become responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of
(individually or collectively, to “Incur” or, as appropriate, an “Incurrence”) any Debt (including Acquired
Debt); provided, however, that the Parent Company and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to
Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if:

(a) on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the
application of the proceeds thereof, on a _pro forma_ basis, the Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Parent Company for the most recently ended four fiscal full quarters for
which internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company are available
immediately preceding the Incurrence of such Debt, taken as one period, would have been at
least 2.0 to 1.0; and

(b) in the case of Senior Secured Debt, on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the
Incurrence of such Senior Secured Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a
_pro forma basis, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio of the Parent Company for_
the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial

274


-----

statements of the Parent Company are available immediately preceding the Incurrence of such
Debt, taken as one period, would have been no greater than 2.0 to 1.0;

_provided, however, that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Debt that may be Incurred by Restricted_
Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors pursuant to this paragraph (1) and pursuant to paragraph (2),
clauses (a), (l), and (t) shall not exceed the greater of €400.0 million and 43% of LTM EBITDA at any time
outstanding; _provided further that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Debt that may be Incurred by_
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer pursuant to this paragraph (1) and pursuant to paragraph (2) (other than (i)
Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (2)(d) and (ii) the deferred and unpaid purchase price of property or services due
more than one year after such property is acquired or such services are completed) shall not exceed the greater of
€50.0 million and 5% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding.

(2) The first paragraph of this covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively, “Permitted
_Debt”):_

(a) the Incurrence by the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit
Facilities (including in respect of letters of credit or banker’s acceptances issued or created

shares of Preferred Stock or Redeemable Capital Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Debt due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Debt

restriction on the Incurrence of Debt, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Debt
denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date such Debt was Incurred, in the case of term Debt, or, at the option of the Parent
Company, first committed, in the case of Debt Incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided that_
(a) if such Debt is Incurred to refinance other Debt denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the

restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such
refinancing Debt does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Debt being refinanced; (b) the

euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Debt outstanding on the Issue Date shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for
so long as any such Debt is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Debt is denominated covering principal and interest on such Debt, the amount of such Debt, if
denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such
Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent of any
premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, for purposes of determining compliance with this
“—Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of
currencies or currency values will not be deemed to exceed the maximum amount that the Parent
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(4) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant,
(a) obligations with respect to letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or similar instruments, guarantees
or Liens or “parallel debt,” in each case supporting Debt otherwise included in the determination of such
particular amount will not be included and (b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable
provisions referred to in the “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens” covenant will not be treated
as Debt.

(5) The amount of any Debt outstanding as of any date will be:

(a) in the case of any Debt issued with original issue discount, the accreted value of such Debt and
in the case of pay in kind Debt, the amount of such Debt shall include any interest paid in the
form of additional Debt;

(b) the principal amount of the Debt or the liquidation preference thereof, as applicable, in the case
of any other Debt determined in accordance with IFRS;

(c) in respect of Debt of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the
lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Debt of the other Person;

(d) in respect of any Redeemable Capital Stock of the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; and

(e) for the avoidance of doubt and in accordance with IFRS, the principal amount of Debt shall be
determined net of any unamortized portion of capitalized debt issuance costs.

(6) If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Debt is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted
Subsidiary shall be in Default of this covenant).

(7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in
clauses (2)(a) through (2)(t) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
“—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Parent Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify
items of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of
such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the Parent Company will be entitled to divide and
classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type
of Debt described in this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that (i) all Debt Incurred
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities and the Segisor Credit
Facility and, in each case, any Permitted Refinancing Debt in respect thereof (and Permitted Refinancing
Debt in respect of such Permitted Refinancing Debt), will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance
on the exception provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified and (ii) all Debt Incurred
pursuant to clause (2)(c)(ii) may not be reclassified.

(8) Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more provisions of
this covenant permitting such Debt.

**_Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under
the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant or for the purposes of the definitions of Permitted Liens or Permitted
Collateral Liens, in each case, in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of
such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Parent Company, be the date
the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall
be calculated on a _pro forma_ basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as
a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent
Company or the target company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of
the relevant Limited Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition and the
related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Parent
Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such
transactions (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred
on the date the definitive agreements are entered into and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any
baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such
Limited Condition Acquisition.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

(1) The Parent Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,

cash, securities or other property) with respect to any of the Parent Company’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any
merger or consolidation involving the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) to the
direct or indirect holders of the Parent Company’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock
in their capacity as holders (other than (i) to the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,
(ii) for dividends or distributions payable solely in Qualified Capital Stock of the Parent
Company, or (iii) to all holders of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary on a pro rata basis
or on a basis that results in the receipt by the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of
dividends or distributions of greater value than the Parent Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary would have received on such pro rata basis);

(b) purchase, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without
limitation, in connection with any merger or consolidation), directly or indirectly, any Capital
Stock of the Parent Company held by persons other than the Parent Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Qualified Capital Stock of the Parent Company);

(c) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire
for value any Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is Subordinated Debt (excluding any

except (i) a payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase,
repurchase or other acquisition of Debt purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled
sinking fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case, due within
one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition; or

the Parent Company was originally sold for cash or Cash Equivalent Investments,
together with, in the case of both sub-clauses (x) and (y), the aggregate net cash
proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property of assets or marketable securities

Company or any Restricted Subsidiary until and to the extent such borrowing is
repaid); plus

(iv) (x) in the case of any Investment that is sold, disposed of or otherwise cancelled,
liquidated or repaid, constituting a Restricted Payment made after the Issue Date, an

or any Restricted Subsidiary and (y) in the case of the designation of an Unrestricted

Subsidiary (as long as, in each case, the designation of such Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary was deemed a Restricted Payment), the Fair Market Value of

the Parent Company’s interest in such Subsidiary as of the date of such designation or
at the time of such merger, consolidation or transfer of assets; plus

(v) to the extent that any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment that was made after
the Issue Date is made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted Subsidiary,
the Fair Market Value of such Investment of the Parent Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary.

(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) above will not prohibit (so long as with respect to clauses (3)(m) and (3)(n) below
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) any of the following (collectively
“Permitted Payments”):

(a) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of its declaration if at such date of its
declaration such payment would have been permitted by the provisions of this covenant;

The Fair Market Value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the Fair Market
Value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors
of the Parent Company acting in good faith.

The Parent Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale,

involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of €47.0 million and 5% of LTM EBITDA
unless:

(a) such transaction or series of related transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less

Affiliates; and

(b) the Parent Company delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any such transaction or series of related
transactions involving aggregate payments or the transfer of assets or provision of services, in each case,

Board of Directors set out in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such transaction or series of related
transactions complies with this covenant and that such transaction or series of related transactions has

(d) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Parent Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Parent Company or an Associate or similar entity (in each

Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in
or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(e) transactions between or among the Parent Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) or between or among Restricted

of the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with the “—
_Limitation on Debt” covenant;_

(f) the execution, delivery and performance of any tax sharing agreement or any arrangement among the
Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Parent Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary files or filed a consolidated tax return or with which the Parent Company or

Indenture and that are fair to the Parent Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries or are on terms at least
as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person, in each
case, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the
Parent Company;

283


-----

(h) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and indemnities and similar payments
(including the payment of directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums) and employee benefit and pension

such directors, officers or employees) in the ordinary course of business;

(i) issuances or sales of Qualified Capital Stock of the Parent Company;

(j) Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(k) transactions (i) on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Parent Company

(ii) in respect of which the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair
to the Parent Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the
terms are not materially less favorable to the Parent Company or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than
those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis;

(l) any transaction effected as part of or in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing or a
Permitted Recourse Receivables Financing; and

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Parent Company will not, and the Parent Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (the “Initial Lien”) of any kind securing
Debt upon any of its property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any property or
asset that does not constitute Collateral, (a) Permitted Liens or (b) Liens on property or assets that are not
Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured at least equally and ratably
with, or, in the case of Liens in respect of Subordinated Debt, prior or senior to, the Debt secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Debt is so secured and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide by
its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of
_the Security”._

**_Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets_**

_Asset Sales_

(1) The Parent Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset
Sale unless:

(a) the consideration the Parent Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Sale is not less than the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined as of the
date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or Capital Stock issued or
sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Parent Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in
respect of such Asset Sale consists of (i) cash; (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) any securities, notes
or other obligations received by the Parent Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Parent Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the extent
of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (iv) the assumption by the purchaser
of any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Parent Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets
and as a result of which the Parent Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer
obligated with respect to such liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities; (v) Debt

284


-----

of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Parent Company and each
Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such Debt in connection with such
Asset Sale; (vi) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2)(e), (2)(f) or
(2)(g) of this covenant; (vii) consideration consisting of Debt (or the cancellation of Debt) of
the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) received by
the Issuer or any Guarantor from Persons who are not the Parent Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; (viii) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of
such Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the time
of receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received and designated as such
pursuant to this sub-clause (viii) (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value), is less than the greater of €140.0 million and 15% of LTM EBITDA; or (ix) a
combination of the consideration specified in sub-clauses (i) to (viii).

(2) If the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds
from such Asset Sale, within 365 days after the consummation of such Asset Sale, may be used or
committed in a binding commitment to be used (provided that such Net Cash Proceeds are actually used
within the later of 365 days from the consummation of the Asset Sale and 180 days from the date of such
binding commitment) at the option of the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary:

(a) to redeem, repay or purchase Notes (including Additional Notes) (i) pursuant to an offer to all
holders of the Notes at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes, _plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not_
including) the date of purchase (a “Notes Offer”) and/or (ii) pursuant to the redemption
provisions set forth above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(b) to purchase or prepay or redeem or repay any Debt other than Public Debt that is secured by a
Lien on assets or property which constitute Collateral;

(c) to purchase or prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Debt of the Parent Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is secured by a Lien on assets or property which do not constitute
Collateral, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the
New Term Loan B Facility, (ii) any Debt under the Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, (iii)
any Debt under the Existing EMTN Bonds which have a final maturity date (x) prior to the final
maturity date of the Notes and (y) after the final maturity date of the Notes for a maximum
aggregate principal amount, with respect to this sub-clause (y) only, of €100.0 million, (iv) any
Debt under the Segisor Credit Facility, or (v) any Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor;

(d) to purchase or prepay or redeem or repay any Pari Passu Debt which is Public Debt that is
secured by a Lien on assets or property which constitute Collateral at a price of no more than
100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such Debt (plus accrued and
unpaid interest) so long as the Issuer, the Parent Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes
an offer on a pro rata basis to all holders of the Notes at a purchase price equal to no less than
100% of the principal amount of the Notes, _plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and_
Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase;

(e) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(f) to make a capital expenditure at the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(g) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Permitted Business
at the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(h) to be credited to the Segregated Accounts (including any Senior Secured Segregated Accounts)
or the Bond Segregated Accounts; or

(i) any combination of the foregoing.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds (including cash or Cash Equivalent Investments
received from the conversion of any securities, notes or other obligations), the Parent Company (or the

285


-----

applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise
invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in clause (2) of this
covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. The Issuer may also at any time, and the Issuer will within
ten Business Days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €50.0 million, make an offer
(an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets the
maximum principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by the terms thereof, on
a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing
any such Pari Passu Debt. The offer price for the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Note (and solely in the case of Pari
Passu Debt, no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of such
Debt), _plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase and Additional_
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Parent
Company (or applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to
purchase the Notes and other Pari Passu Debt for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or validly
tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt to be purchased will be purchased, prepaid or redeemed, as
applicable, on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of the Notes and the principal amount
or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt to be prepaid or tendered by each holder). Upon completion of
each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes to be purchased exceeds the amount of proceeds received for application to
such principal amount, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro
_rata basis (or in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered._

(6) If the Issuer is obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and Pari
Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of €1,000, on a
date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess
Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act;
_provided that no Note of less than €100,000 remains outstanding thereafter._

(7) The Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture,
the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached their respective obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant “—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Asset Sales” shall not apply
to any Specific Perimeter Asset Sale.

_Specific Perimeter Asset Sales_

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, consummate any Specific Perimeter
Asset Sale, unless:

(a) the consideration the Issuer or such Subsidiary receives for such Specific Perimeter Asset Sale
is not less than the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined as of the date
of contractually agreeing to such Specific Perimeter Asset Sale) of the assets sold or Capital
Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(b) the consideration the Issuer or such Subsidiary receives in respect of such Specific Perimeter
Asset Sale consists of (i) cash; (ii) Cash Equivalent Investments; (iii) a Permitted Specific
Perimeter Asset Swap; provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the assets received in
such Permitted Specific Perimeter Asset Swap, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the
time of receipt of all other assets received pursuant to this clause (1)(b) in connection with a
Permitted Specific Perimeter Asset Swap (with the Fair Market Value of each asset received
pursuant to a Permitted Specific Perimeter Asset Swap being measured at the time received and

286


-----

without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), is less than €50.0 million; or (iv) a
combination of the consideration specified in sub-clauses (i) to (iii).

(2) If the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries consummates a Specific Perimeter Asset Sale, the Net Cash
Proceeds from such Specific Perimeter Asset Sale may be used (together with the Net Cash Proceeds
from prior Specific Perimeter Asset Sales credited to the Bond Segregated Accounts, if applicable), at
the option of the Issuer, to redeem, repay or purchase the Notes of all series (including any Additional
Notes) on a pro rata basis (i) pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under “—Optional
_Redemption” and/or (ii) pursuant to an offer to all holders of the Notes of each series at a purchase price_
equal to the relevant optional redemption prices set forth above under “—Optional Redemption,” then
applicable to such series plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to
(but not including) the date of purchase (a “Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer”); provided
that prior to November 15, 2021, the purchase price will be equal to the relevant optional redemption
price applicable to such series on November 15, 2021.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds as provided in clause (2) of this covenant, the
Issuer (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall credit those Net Cash Proceeds to the Bond Segregated
Accounts.

(4) Any Net Cash Proceeds from Specific Perimeter Asset Sales that are not applied as provided in clause
(2) of this covenant shall be credited to the Bond Segregated Accounts.

(5) To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Notes tendered pursuant to a Specific Perimeter
Asset Sale Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds from Specific
Perimeter Asset Sales, the Issuer (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall credit the amount of such Net Cash
Proceeds not used to purchase the Notes to the Bond Segregated Accounts. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount
of Net Cash Proceeds from Specific Perimeter Asset Sales, the Notes to be purchased will be purchased
on a _pro rata_ basis (based upon the principal amount of the Notes tendered by each holder). If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased exceeds the amount of proceeds received for
application to such principal amount, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the Notes to be
purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the
amounts tendered.

(6) If the Issuer is obligated to make an Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will
purchase the Notes, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in integral multiples of €1,000,
on a date that is not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Specific
Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer is given to such holders, or such later date as may be required under
the Exchange Act; provided that no Note of less than €100,000 remains outstanding thereafter.

(7) The Issuer will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offer.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Specific Perimeter
Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Specific
Perimeter Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

(8) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will only be
required to apply any Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with clauses (2) through (7) of this covenant to
the extent that the sum of (i) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from all Specific Perimeter Asset Sales
which are not applied in accordance with clauses (2) through (7) of this covenant and (ii) the Fair Market
Value of any assets of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on a consolidated basis that (x) enters into
a transaction pursuant to the covenant under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” in which it is
no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or (y) is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant
to the covenant under “—Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries” (with the Fair Market
Value of such assets being measured at the time of such transaction or designation and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value), exceeds €50.0 million, and, in such event, only the excess will be
required to be so applied.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant “—Limitation on Sale of Certain Assets—Specific Perimeter Asset
_Sales” shall not apply to any Permitted Specific Perimeter Reorganization._

287


-----

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Parent Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly,
to guarantee the payment of any other Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary
simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee
of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior
to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Debt.

Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, benefit, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary
(a) existing on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the Transactions on the Issue Date); (b) that existed at the time
such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) given to a bank or trust company having
combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than €250.0 million, whose debt has a rating, at the
time such guarantee was given, of at least “BBB” or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least “Baa2” or the
equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for
the benefit of the Parent Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Company shall not be obligated to cause a Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the payment of the Notes to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) a violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be
prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent Company or the Restricted
Subsidiary; (b) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; (c) significant
cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings
required as a result or, or any measures pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in connection with, such Note Guarantee,
which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Parent Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; or (d) an inconsistency with the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Subsequent Guarantors and Collateral_**

The Parent Company shall take, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take, such necessary actions, so that
no later than the earlier of (i) 30 days after the Latam Reorganization Completion Date and (ii) March 31, 2020,
Segisor shall become a guarantor of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which Segisor will provide such guarantee. In addition, the Parent Company shall take, and shall cause
its Restricted Subsidiaries to take, such necessary actions, so that on or before the date Segisor becomes a
guarantor of the Notes, all intragroup receivables owed to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loan made available by
the Issuer to Segisor are pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes.

Furthermore, the Parent Company shall take, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to take, such necessary
actions, so that no later than December 31, 2019, Casino Finance shall become a guarantor of the Notes by
executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which Casino Finance will provide
such guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Parent Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause
or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital
Stock to the Parent Company, the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to
any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Parent Company, the Issuer (including any Proceeds Loan) or any
other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Parent Company, the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;
or

288


-----

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent Company, the Issuer or any other Restricted
Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made to the Parent Company, the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt (other than any Proceeds Loan) Incurred by the Parent Company, the Issuer
or any other Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to encumbrances or
restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(a) the Notes (including Additional Notes), the Note Guarantees, the Indenture, the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Account Charge or the Security Documents;

(b) any agreements or instruments with respect to Debt of the Parent Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
“—Limitation on Debt,” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that such
encumbrances or restrictions taken as a whole, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of senior management of the Parent Company are not materially less
favorable to the holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the
Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) is customary in comparable financings and, in
the case of this sub-clause (ii), the Parent Company determines at the time such Debt is Incurred
that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the
Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or treasurer of the
Parent Company);

(c) any agreements or instruments (including with respect to Debt) in effect on the Issue Date and
any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of those agreements; _provided_ that the amendments, restatements,
modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Parent Company);

(d) customary non-assignment and similar provisions in contracts, leases and licenses entered into
in the ordinary course of business;

(e) any agreement or other instrument of a Person (including its Subsidiaries) acquired by the Parent
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of such acquisition (but not created
in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or
the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the
Person, so acquired (including its Subsidiaries);

(f) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock or all or substantially all the
property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions of such Capital Stock
or property and assets of that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(g) Liens permitted to be Incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the
caption “—Limitation on Liens” that limit the right to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(h) applicable law, rule, regulation or order or the terms of any governmental licenses,
authorizations, concessions, franchises or permits;

(i) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers or required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each case,

joint venture and shareholder agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements,

289


-----

stock sale agreements and other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in
connection with a Restricted Investment), which limitations are applicable only to the assets
that are the subject of such agreements;

(k) Purchase Money Obligations and mortgage financings for property acquired in the ordinary
course of business and Capitalized Lease Obligations that impose restrictions on the property
purchased or leased of the nature described in clause (1)(d) of the preceding paragraph;

(l) any agreement that extends, renews, amends, modifies, restates, supplements, refunds,
refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the
foregoing clauses (2)(a) through (2)(k), or in this clause (2)(l); _provided that the terms and_
conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable, taken as
a whole, to the holders of the Notes than those under or pursuant to the agreement so extended,
renewed, amended, modified, restated, supplemented, refunded, refinanced or replaced (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer or treasurer of the Parent Company);

(m) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(n) any Qualified Securitization Financing; and

(o) any Permitted Recourse Receivables Financing.

**_Certain Transfers to Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Material Intellectual Property and any rights thereto
owned by the Parent Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted to be transferred to any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, whether by (i) designation pursuant to the covenant under “—Designation of
_Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries” or (ii) sale, transfer or other disposition._

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

From the Issue Date until the Latam Reorganization Completion Date, all members of the Latam Group will be
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Company for purposes of the Indenture, except that (i) Segisor and all of
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (other than CBD and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries) and (ii) Tevir and all
of its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (other than Almacenes Éxito and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries) will be
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Company. As of the Latam Reorganization Completion Date, the members
of the Latam Group will no longer be Subsidiaries of the Parent Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Segisor
and Tevir and all of their respective direct and indirect Subsidiaries will remain Restricted Subsidiaries for
purposes of the Indenture.

In addition, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company may designate any Subsidiary of the Parent Company
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming
a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction, or Investment therein) if
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving
effect to such designation and such Subsidiary to be so designated or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any
Capital Stock or Debt of, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, the Parent Company or any other Subsidiary
of the Parent Company that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value
of all outstanding Investments owned by the Parent Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation
and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the
caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Investments”, as determined by the Parent Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment of
the Parent Company in such Subsidiary would be permitted at that time under the covenant “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments”. The Board of Directors of the Parent Company may redesignate any Unrestricted_
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company may not designate the
Issuer Holdco, the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be Unrestricted Subsidiaries; _provided,_
_however, that a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if it owns_
assets of a Fair Market Value not exceeding, when taken together with (i) the Fair Market Value of assets owned
by the Subsidiaries of such Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Fair Market Value of any assets of any other Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer that has entered into a transaction pursuant to the covenant under “—Consolidation,
_Merger and Sale of Assets” in which it is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, (iii) the Fair Market_

290


-----

Value of any assets of any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that has been designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary pursuant to this covenant and (iv) the Fair Market Value of any assets of any other Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer that are the subject of a Specific Perimeter Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of which
are not applied in accordance with clauses (2) through (7) of the covenant under “—Limitation on Sale of Certain
_Assets—Specific Perimeter Asset Sales” in reliance on clause (8) thereof (with the Fair Market Value of such_
assets being measured at the time of such transaction or designation and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value), €50.0 million.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Parent Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation
and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was
permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Board of Directors of the Parent Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Debt by a Restricted
Subsidiary of any outstanding Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted
if (1) such Debt is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Debt,” calculated
on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and
(2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Parent Company as a Restricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by
filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Parent Company giving effect to
such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding
conditions.

**_Provision of Information_**

with (i) a breakdown identifying the impact of the Latam Group on such consolidated metrics of the
Parent Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) a reconciliation between (x) such metrics pursuant to IFRS
as of the date of such reports and information and (y) such metrics pursuant to IFRS excluding the impact
of IFRS 16 Leases and any successor standard thereto, in each case with high level commentaries on the
variations of such metrics compared to the prior period;

(e) simultaneously with the reports and information referred to under (i) clauses (a) and (b) above, in English,
amounts credited to or debited from the Segregated Accounts (including any Senior Secured Segregated
Accounts) and the Bond Segregated Accounts during such period, together with their respective balances
as at the end of such period and (ii) clause (a) above, in English, an annual overview of the real estate

presentation in the Offering Memorandum; and

(f) in English, such other material information that it is required to make publicly available pursuant to the

Euronext Paris;

_provided that the Parent Company shall be deemed to have provided the information set forth in clauses (a) through_
(f) of this covenant if it has posted such information to its company website and such information is publicly
available within the meaning of the French Listed Company Requirements.

So long as the Parent Company’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on Euronext Paris and the Parent
Company complies with the French Listed Company Requirements, to the extent that such requirements include
an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual and semi-annual financial reports, information,
documents and other reports in accordance with the French Listed Company Requirements in English, the Parent
Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (a), (b), (c) and (f) of the first
paragraph of this covenant; provided that (x) the Parent Company makes publicly available for the first and third
quarters in each fiscal year of the Parent Company, through a press release, the main financial metrics of the

Company, the Parent Company also provides the information required by clauses (d) and (e) of the first paragraph
of this covenant simultaneously with the reports and other information provided pursuant to this second paragraph.

All historical financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect from time to time. Except
as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Parent Company or any
Subsidiaries of the Parent Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial
or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum and in no event (i) shall U.S. GAAP
information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required nor (ii) shall such report include separate financial
statements for any Guarantor and non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent Company.

In addition, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Parent
Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g32(b) under the Exchange Act, the Parent Company will make available to any prospective purchaser of Notes or
beneficial owner of Notes in connection with any sale thereof the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the Securities Act.

292


-----

At any time that any of the Parent Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries (other than members of
the Latam Group) and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries (in each case other
than one or more members of the Latam Group), taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Parent Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first and second paragraphs
of this “—Provision of Information” covenant will include information in English setting out, with respect to the
main financial metrics of the Parent Company and its Subsidiaries, which shall include, at a minimum, revenue,
EBITDA, gross financial debt and cash, along with (i) a breakdown identifying the impact of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries on such consolidated metrics of the Parent Company, and (ii) a
reconciliation between (x) such metrics pursuant to IFRS as of the date of such reports and information and (y)
such metrics pursuant to IFRS as defined under the Indenture (i.e., excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases and
any successor standard thereto).

In the event that (i) the Parent Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required
by Section 13(a) with the Commission or (ii) the Parent Company elects to provide reports which, if filed with
the Commission, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Parent Company) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications,
exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Parent Company will
make available such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Parent Company is, or
would be, required to file with the Commission pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the
foregoing requirement, the Parent Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in
clauses (a), (b) and (c) above.

**_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets_**

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the

required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this covenant
and that the supplemental indenture and the Notes constitute the Issuer’s or Issuer Surviving Entity’s
legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms provided that in giving
an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including
as to satisfaction of clauses (b) and (c) above.

The Issuer Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the
Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents.

_The Parent Company and the Issuer Holdco_

Person), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties
or assets of the Parent Company or the Issuer Holdco, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted

Note Guarantee constitute the Parent Company’s or the Issuer Holdco’s, as applicable, or Parent
Surviving Entity’s legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their terms
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_

294


-----

The Parent Surviving Entity will succeed to, be substituted for and may exercise every right and power of the
Parent Company or the Issuer Holdco, as applicable, under the relevant Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

_Guarantors_

A Guarantor (other than the Parent Company and the Issuer Holdco and other than any Guarantor whose Note
Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Note Guarantee and the Indenture as described
under “—The Note Guarantees”) will not, directly or indirectly, (1) consolidate or merge with or into another
Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which
are Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(a) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and
be continuing; and

(b) either:

(i) the Person acquiring the property or assets in any such sale or disposition or the Person
formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer or a
Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant
Proceeds Loans (as applicable) and the Security Documents to which such Guarantor is party
pursuant to a supplemental indenture, accession agreement, security documents and any other
relevant document, in each case, delivered to the Trustee and the Security Agent, as
applicable; or

(ii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Parent Company or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant under “—Consolidation, Merger and
_Sale of Assets—The Issuer”, clauses (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant under “—The Parent_
_Company and the Issuer Holdco” and clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant under “—Guarantors”_
(which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the
Issuer Holdco or the Issuer) may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to the Parent Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer Holdco or the Issuer);
_provided, however, that the Real Estate Company and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries may not_
consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or substantially all of their properties and assets to other Restricted
Subsidiaries unless: (1)(A) the surviving entity is the Real Estate Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Real
Estate Company, or (B) the sum of (i) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from all Specific Perimeter Asset Sales
which are not applied in accordance with clauses (2) through (7) of the covenant under “—Limitation on Sale of
_Certain Assets—Specific Perimeter Asset Sales” in reliance on clause (8) thereof and (ii) the Fair Market Value_
of any assets of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer on a consolidated basis that (x) enters into a transaction
pursuant to this covenant under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” in which it is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or (y) is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to the covenant under “—
_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries” (with the Fair Market Value of such assets being_
measured at the time of such transaction or designation and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value),
does not exceed €50.0 million; and (2) there would not be a default under any other agreement to which the Parent
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this “Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”
covenant will not apply to any transaction or arrangement that is a Permitted Reorganization.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property
or assets of a Person.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent Company will not, and the Parent Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which would have the result of materially impairing

295


-----

the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on the
Collateral permitted by the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens” and the implementation of any Permitted
Reorganization shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Parent Company will not, and
the Parent Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described
in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release
of the Collateral in accordance with any other provision of the Indenture (including without limitation, in
connection with a Permitted Reorganization), the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Parent Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens or implement any Permitted Reorganization; and _provided further, however, that,_
except with respect to clauses (a) and (b) of the foregoing proviso (provided that, in the case of such clause (b),
unless no release of the relevant Lien securing the Notes is required in order for the Parent Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary to Incur a Permitted Collateral Lien or implement any Permitted Reorganization, such Lien
securing the Notes is retaken immediately following its release in connection with such Incurrence), no Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced or a
Lien over the Collateral released and immediately retaken unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Parent
Company delivers to the Trustee any of (1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment
bank or accounting firm, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Parent
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking, (2) a certificate
from the Board of Directors or the chief financial officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of
such Person after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release and retaking and replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement or release and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and
retaken are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity (if legally applicable) or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and
retaking.

At the written direction of the Parent Company and without the consent of the holders of the Notes, the Security
Agent and, if necessary, the Trustee may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security
Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted
Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence
the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the applicable Note Guarantee and the Security Documents, in each
case, in accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;” or as result of a
Permitted Reorganization; (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Lien
of the Security Documents or the release of the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with
(and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture; (vii) conform the Security Documents to this “Description of the
Notes;” (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security
Agent; (ix) provide for Additional Notes to also benefit from the Collateral; or (x) make any other change thereto
that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Parent Company complies with this covenant, the Security Agent and the Trustee (subject to
customary protections and indemnifications), if required, shall take all action necessary to effect such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the written request of the Parent Company, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence or refinancing of any Debt
that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Parent Company, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Trustee and
the Security Agent will (without the consent of the holders of the Notes) enter into an additional intercreditor
agreement (each an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or more favorable to the holders of the Notes) or an amendment to or an amendment and restatement
of the Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment in the good faith judgment of the Parent Company does not
adversely affect the rights of holder of the Notes in any material respect), it being understood that an increase in

296


-----

the amount of Debt being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed
not to adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each case,
the Incurrence of such Debt (and any Lien in its favor is permitted by the “Limitation on Debt” and “Limitation
_on Liens” covenants; provided that such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not_
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, protections, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee and the Security Agent under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Parent Company and without the consent of
the holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, error, defect or inconsistency of such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Debt covered by
such agreement that may be Incurred by the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject
to such agreement (including with respect to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Debt ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes or the
Note Guarantees, or an amendment or modification of provisions relating to Debt ranking junior in right of
payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees if such amendments do not adversely affect the holders of the Notes
in any material respect), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or new Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision
for equal and ratable pledges of or call options on the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) to enable a Permitted Reorganization, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, or (9) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect; provided that such
amendments or modifications will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, protections, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee and the Security
Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the holders of the Notes to
the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of Subordinated
Debt; provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under the caption “—Restricted
_Payments”. The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have_
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and any amendment that complies with the provisions of this covenant, and none of the Issuer, the
Trustee or the Security Agent will be required to seek the consent of any holders of the Notes to perform its
obligations under and in accordance with this covenant. Each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have consented
to and directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to execute the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or amendment or amendment and restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement that complies with the provisions of this covenant.

**_Limitation on Amendments to the Proceeds Loans_**

repurchase or discharge of the Notes or (B) credited to the Bond Segregated Account;

(2) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the

Issuer shall at all times be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of the Issuer Holdco. The Issuer Holdco shall at all
times be a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent Company.

**_Limitation on Amendments of the New Master Lease Agreement_**

The Parent Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
waive, amend, modify or supplement any of the terms or provisions of the New Master Lease Agreement and the
underlying new leases (once executed) in a manner adverse in any material respect to the holders of the Notes or
the relevant lessors thereunder. In addition, the Parent Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, cause a default under any material term or provision of the New Master Lease Agreement or any
underlying new lease (once executed) in a manner adverse in any material respect to the holders of the Notes or
the relevant lessors thereunder.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to
obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines
that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing
of such Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Parent Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of the Notes for or as an inducement to
any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such
consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in
the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer
or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms
or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude holders of the Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or
(b) the payment of the consideration therefor, would require the Parent Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its
member states), and the Parent Company in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) such filing
would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the
consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with
the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be
permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

or premium, if any, on any Note;

(c) failure by the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice to
the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the

Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is
specifically dealt with in clauses (a) or (b) above) or the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the
Security Documents;

(d) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing Debt by the Parent Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Debt owed to the Parent Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary) if that default (x) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt or (y) is
caused by a failure to pay principal of such Debt at the Stated Maturity thereof after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods, and such failure to make any payment has not been

299


-----

waived or the maturity of such Debt has not been extended (a “Payment Default”), and in either
case the aggregate principal amount of such Debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds €60.0 million;

(e) any Note Guarantee existing on the Issue Date or any other Note Guarantee of a Significant
Subsidiary or a group of Guarantors that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be, is held in any judicial proceeding or shall be asserted in writing by any
Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, not to be, in full force and effect
or enforceable in accordance with its terms (other than as provided for in the Indenture, any
Note Guarantee or the Intercreditor Agreement);

(f) failure by the Parent Company or any Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final
judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal) entered by a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction aggregating in excess of €60.0 million (exclusive of any amounts covered by
insurance policies issued by reputable and creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments
shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive
days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment, order or decree (by reason
of pending appeal, waiver or otherwise) shall not have been in effect;

(g) (i) the security interests purported to be created under any Security Document (with respect to
Collateral) having a Fair Market Value in excess of €40.0 million will (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture), at any time, cease to be in full force and effect and
to constitute a valid and perfected Lien with the priority required by the applicable Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Indenture for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture
and discharge of the Indenture or in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents or (ii) any
security interest purported to be created under any Security Document is declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Parent Company or any Restricted Subsidiary granting Collateral that is
the subject of any such Security Interest asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent
jurisdiction, that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable, and, in the case of subclause (i), such failure to be in full force and effect or such assertion has continued uncured for
a period of 15 days;

(h) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with
respect to the Parent Company, the Issuer, a Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary or group
of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; and

(i) (i) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date as described above under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption” or (ii) the Liens granted over the Escrow Account in favor of the_
Trustee for the benefit of itself and the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the Escrow
Account Charge being held in any non-appealable judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or
invalid;

_provided, however, that a Default under clauses (c), (d) or (f) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of_
Default until the Trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of
the Default and, with respect to such clauses (c), (d) or (f), the Parent Company does not cure such Default within
the time specified in such clauses (c), (d) or (f), as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

(2) If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clauses (1)(h) or (1)(i)(i) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding by written notice to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders)
may, and the Trustee, upon the written request of such holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium,
if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all the outstanding Notes immediately due
and payable, and upon any such declaration all such amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become
immediately due and payable.

(3) If an Event of Default specified in clauses (1)(h) or (1)(i)(i) above occurs and is continuing, then the
principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all the
outstanding Notes shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other
act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the Notes.

300


-----

(4) The Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive
any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default in the
payment of interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, or the principal of any Notes held by a
non-consenting holder, which may only be waived with the consent of holders of the Notes holding 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture) and rescind any
acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with
any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). In the event of any Event of Default specified in
clause (1)(d) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment
default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived or rescinded,
automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders, if within 20 days after such Event of
Default arose: (i) the indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been
discharged; (ii) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case
may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (iii) the Default that is the basis for such Event of Default
has been cured.

(5) At any time after a declaration of acceleration under the Indenture, but before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind
such declaration and its consequences if:

(a) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee (or another party designated by the Trustee for
this purpose) a sum sufficient to pay:

(i) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Notes then outstanding;

(ii) all unpaid principal of and premium, if any, on any outstanding Notes that have become
due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate
borne by the Notes;

(iii) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest and
overdue principal at the rate borne by the Notes; and

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the properly Incurred
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsels;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction; and

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of amounts of principal of, premium, if any,
and any Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes that has become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(6) Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.

(7) In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of the Notes
unless such holders have made written request and offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of any of
the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any remedy
thereunder, unless:

(a) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made
written request to, and offered indemnity and/or security satisfactory to, the Trustee to institute
such proceeding as trustee under the Notes and the Indenture;

(b) the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee; and

(c) the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions inconsistent with such written
request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

301


-----

Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of
the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or
after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.

(8) If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
has written notice, the Trustee will deliver to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default or Event of
Default within 30 Business Days after receipt of such written notice. Except in the case of a Default or
an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any
Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such Notes if a committee of its trust officers
in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes.

(9) The Issuer is required to furnish to the Trustee annual written statements regarding compliance with the
Indenture and as to the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The Issuer is also required to notify
the Trustee in writing within 30 days of the occurrence of any Default (unless cured) or Event of Default
stating what action, if any, it is taking with respect to such Default or Event of Default.

(10) The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another Default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will
also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Provision of Information” or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be
cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture**

The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes issued
under the Indenture and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their applicable Note
Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such Notes (including Additional Amounts, if any) when such payments are due
from the trust referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the
Notes and segregate and hold such payments in trust;

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including, without limitation, its obligation to make Change
of Control Offers, Excess Proceeds Offers and Specific Perimeter Asset Sale Proceeds Offers) set forth in the
Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs,
certain events described under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to
the Notes. These events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the Issuer,
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option
regardless of whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the Trustee (or such other entity
nominated by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euro, noncallable European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, in such amounts as
will be sufficient, in the opinion of internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of
independent public accountants taking into account the effect of any hedging arrangements entered into
in connection with such deposit, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest

302


-----

(including Additional Amounts, if any) on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the
applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must (x) specify whether the Notes are
being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (y) if applicable, have
delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Notes of such principal,
premium, if any, or interest;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial
owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance
had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the
Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(e) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder when:

(a) either:

(i) all the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited
in trust or segregated and held in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from
such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified
to the Trustee) for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Trustee) for
cancellation (x) have become due and payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of
redemption or otherwise), (y) will become due and payable within one year or (z) are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer and
the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee
(or such other entity nominated by the Trustee for this purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for
the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Debt on the Notes
not delivered to the Paying Agent (and notified to the Trustee) for cancellation for principal,
premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; and

(b) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the
Indenture; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
have been satisfied; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the
Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Account Charge, any Proceeds Loan, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and
any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Account Charge, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

However, without the consent of the holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount
of Notes (including without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a

request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Opinion of Counsel and an
Officer’s Certificate on which the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, may solely rely.

The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee,
subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that, in case an Event of Default of which a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers
vested in it by the Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation
to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such
holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
its duties.

When Consolidated EBITDA is being calculated for the purpose of any grower basket set forth in this Description
of Notes, it shall be calculated on a pro forma basis consistent with the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for
purposes of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.

“Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to a specified Person for any period, the ratio
of the Consolidated EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period.
In the event that the specified Person or any Restricted Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary of such specified Person
incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Debt (other than
ordinary working capital borrowings) or issues, repurchases or redeems preferred stock subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated and
on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio is made (for the purpose of this definition, the “Calculation Date”) (but not giving effect to any additional
Debt to be incurred on the Calculation Date as part of the same transaction or series of transactions pursuant to
paragraph (2) under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”), then the Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by an Officer or a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent Company) to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee,
repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Debt, or such issuance, repurchase or
redemption of preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning

314

of the applicable four-quarter reference period. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio:

(a) acquisitions of any Person, business or group of assets that constitutes an operating unit or division of
business that have been made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries,
including through mergers, consolidations, amalgamations or otherwise, or by any Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by such specified Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including all related financing transactions and
including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries (including Persons
who become Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such increase), during the four-quarter reference period
or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or that are to be made on
the Calculation Date, will be given _pro forma_ effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Parent Company and may include anticipated expense and cost
reduction and cost saving synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference
period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with
IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation
Date, will be excluded;

(c) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and
operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will
be excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be
obligations of such specified Person or any Restricted Subsidiary which is a Subsidiary of such specified
Person following the Calculation Date;

(d) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period;

(e) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period; and

(f) if any Debt bears a floating rate of interest and such Debt is to be given _pro forma effect, the interest_
expense on such Debt will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Debt
if such Hedging Obligation has a remaining term as at the Calculation Date in excess of 12 months, or,
if shorter, at least equal to the remaining term of such Debt).

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Adjusted Net
Income and Fixed Charges, calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Parent Company.

“Consolidated Leverage” means, with respect to the Parent Company, as of any date of determination, (x) the
aggregate amount of Debt of the Parent Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding Hedging Obligations
entered into in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Parent Company)) on a consolidated basis minus
(y) the aggregate amount of proceeds credited to the Segregated Accounts and the Bond Segregated Accounts as
of such date of determination, which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt, the cash proceeds of any Debt in
respect of, or in connection with, which the calculation of the Consolidated Leverage is to be made if such cash
proceeds are to be credited at the time of Incurrence to the Segregated Accounts or the Bond Segregated Accounts.

“Consolidated Leverage Ratio” means, with respect to the Parent Company, as of any date of determination, the
ratio of (a) the Consolidated Leverage of the Parent Company on such date to (b) the LTM EBITDA of the Parent
Company. In the event that the Parent Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees,
repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Debt (other than ordinary working capital
borrowings) or issues, repurchases or redeems Redeemable Capital Stock or preferred stock subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the
date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is made (for the purpose of
this definition, the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma
effect to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
discharge of Debt, or such issuance, repurchase or redemption of Redeemable Capital Stock or preferred stock,
and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
reference period. For purposes of calculating the Consolidated EBITDA for such period:

(a) acquisitions of any Person, business or group of assets that constitutes an operating unit or division of a
business that have been made by such Person or any of its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries,

Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by such specified Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, and including any related financing transactions and
including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries (including Persons
who become Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such increase), during the four-quarter reference period
or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date (including transactions
giving rise to the need to calculate such Consolidated Leverage Ratio) will be given pro forma effect (as
determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent Company and may
include anticipated expense and cost reduction and cost saving synergies) as if they had occurred on the
first day of the four-quarter reference period;

(b) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with
IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of on or prior to the
Calculation Date (including transactions giving rise to the need to calculate such Consolidated Leverage
Ratio), will be excluded;

(c) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four-quarter period; and

(d) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to an Asset Sale, Investment or
acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto or the amount of Consolidated EBITDA associated
therewith, the pro forma calculation shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting
Officer of the Parent Company. In determining the amount of Debt outstanding on any date of determination,
_pro forma_ effect will be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition,
retirement or discharge or Debt on such date.

“Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage” means, with respect to the Parent Company, as of any date of
determination, (x) the aggregate outstanding Senior Secured Debt of the Parent Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries minus (y) the aggregate amount of proceeds credited to the Senior Secured Segregated Accounts and
the Bond Segregated Accounts as of such date of determination, which shall include, for the avoidance of doubt,
the cash proceeds of any Debt in respect of, or in connection with, which the calculation of the Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage is to be made if such cash proceeds are to be credited at the time of Incurrence to the
Senior Secured Segregated Accounts or the Bond Segregated Accounts.

“Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio” means, with respect to the Parent Company, as of any date of
determination, the ratio of (a) the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage of the Parent Company on such date to
(b) the LTM EBITDA of the Parent Company, in each case, with such _pro forma adjustments to Consolidated_
Senior Secured Leverage and LTM EBITDA as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma provisions set
forth in the definition of “Consolidated Leverage Ratio” (it being understood that the _pro forma_ adjustments
applicable to Consolidated Leverage in such definition shall be applicable to Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage for purposes of this definition, except that such ratio shall not give effect to any additional Senior
Secured Debt to be Incurred on the date of determination as part of the same transaction or series of transactions
pursuant to paragraph (2) under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” (other than clause (2)(l)

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The Notes
sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date,
with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear
and/or Clearstream or persons who may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be
shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear
and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on
their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially
owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form.
The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in
their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the
registered owners or “holder” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such,
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests
in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee under the Indenture, the Agents nor any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have
any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered form
(the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

  - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository
for the Global Notes and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer; or

  - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interests requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their
respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred
to in “Transfer restrictions” unless such legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them or it in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal
to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit

334


-----

their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000
principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional
interest and additional amounts then required to be paid under the Notes) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying
Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute
such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Agents will treat the registered holder of the
Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for
the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, or the
Agents or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes,
will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any
discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.
However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the
holders of the Notes where enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof, reserves the right to exchange the
Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires the physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require the
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer restrictions”. Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer restrictions”.

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

335


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any
other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a
QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and exchange”, and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer restrictions”.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee
or any of the Agents is responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders.
Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require
that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear
or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and
listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any
Notes will be settled in accordance with rules and operating procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or

336


-----

modified at any time. None of us, the Trustee or the Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. BookEntry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can
be made on the desired value date.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a general discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax and French withholding tax_
_considerations that may be relevant to prospective purchasers of the Notes. This summary is based on the laws in_
_force and interpretations thereof in the United States and France as the date of this Listing Prospectus and is_
_subject to any changes in law that may take effect after such date, possibly with a retroactive effect. It does not_
_purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to_
_purchase, hold or dispose of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their tax_
_advisors as to the tax consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase_
_of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and upon_
_the sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except
for the discussion on Additional Notes and on FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance
_Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, the_
impact of the alternative minimum tax or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income
tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below.
There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities,
regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or
arrangements (or investors in such entities or arrangements), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent
establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”,
“conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a
result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial
statement” (as defined in section 451 of the Code). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase
the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the
meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity
taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S.
federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control
all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors
regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding the Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal**
**income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws,**
**the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, the U.S. alternative minimum tax and state, local,**
**non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal
and interest or otherwise subject to contingencies (see “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption”, “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”, “Description of the Notes—Purchase_
_of Notes upon a Change of Control”, and “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”). We intend to take_
the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. This position is based, in part, on assumptions regarding the likelihood of such payments as of the
date of issuance of the Notes. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to account
for the tax consequences of the receipt of such payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in
accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is
binding on a holder unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position.
If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments,
U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the Note
and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or
redemption of a Note. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt
instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes and the consequences thereof.

**_Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar
value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received)
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder
will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an
accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating
such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that
spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An
accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the
spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of
an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to all other debt instruments held by an electing U.S.
holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued
interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the
interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss and not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any such exchange
gain or loss will be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered
“passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income
tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder
may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
subject to applicable limitations.

339


-----

The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s
particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility
of any foreign taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition
(other than amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income
as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder. If a
U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase. If a Note is traded on an established securities market, a
cash method U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual method U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value
of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
purchase.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If a Note is traded on an established securities market,
a cash method U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual method U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value
of the amount realized by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. An
accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that
there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally
will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded
on an established securities market, which is discussed in the two preceding paragraphs, must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is
attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note will be
ordinary income or loss and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income,
respectively, and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal
the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for
the Note, determined on the date such payment is received or such Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the Note, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired such Note.
In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder
may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received in respect of accrued and unpaid stated interest,
which will be treated as discussed above under “—Interest”. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss (including with
respect to principal and accrued but unpaid interest) only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such
U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of exchange gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any
such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain
prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and
the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes”. These Additional Notes,
even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in some cases may
be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may be

340


-----

considered to have OID, which may adversely affect the market value of the original Notes if the Additional Notes
are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover
transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain
circumstances, the receipt of interest, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note to the extent that any such receipt, sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount.
U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is
an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise
complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the appropriate
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. holders who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as defined in section 6038D of
the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes on IRS Form 8938, subject to
certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions).
If a U.S. holder does not file the required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and
the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the
related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and
disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject to
the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax
on certain “foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S.
source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the applicable final regulations
defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered”
unless materially modified after such date. Such final regulations have not been published yet. Accordingly, if the
Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period,
have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the original Notes issued hereby and are subject to withholding under FATCA,
then withholding agents may treat all the Notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under
FATCA. Under recently proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are
not otherwise grandfathered would apply to foreign passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. France
and other non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a
manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their tax advisors on how these rules may
apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any
payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain French tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain of the material French tax considerations relating to the purchase,
ownership and disposal of the Notes by a holder of the Notes that: (i) is not a French resident for French tax

341


-----

purposes; (ii) is not a shareholder of the Issuer; (iii) is not related to the Issuer within the meaning of Article 39.12
of the French Tax Code; and (iv) does not hold the Notes in connection with a business or profession conducted
in France, or a permanent establishment or fixed base situated in France.

This summary is based on the tax laws and regulations of France, as currently in effect and applied by the French
tax authorities, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the
French tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances.
Furthermore, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations.

PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO FRENCH TAX
CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL OF THE NOTES IN
LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

Article 1649 AC of the French Tax Code imposes a requirement on financial institutions within the meaning of
Article 1 of Decree n°2016-1683 to review and collect information on their clients and investors, in order to
identify their tax residence, as well as to provide certain account information to relevant foreign tax authorities
(via the French tax authorities) on an annual basis.

**_Payments of interest and other revenues in respect of the Notes_**

Payments of interest and other assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will not be
subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are
made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning
of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than those mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2˚ of the same
code (a “Non-Cooperative State”), irrespective of the holder’s residence for tax purposes or registered
headquarters. Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code, if such payments under the Notes are made
in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% mandatory withholding tax will be due (subject to certain exceptions certain
of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty). The
list of Non-Cooperative States is, in principle, updated each year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Legal and
_Regulatory Matters—The adoption by the Council of the European Union of an EU list of non-cooperative_
_jurisdiction for tax purposes and the use of this list in the jurisdictions where we operate may impact our financial_
_results”._

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest and other assimilated revenues on the
Notes may not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or
established in a privileged tax jurisdiction (i.e., where such persons would be subject to a tax lower than 50% (or
lower than 40% as from January 1, 2020 pursuant to the Law that aims at fighting tax fraud) of the tax they would
have incurred had they been domiciled or established in France) or a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account
opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State within the meaning of Article 238-0 A
of the French Tax Code (including those mentioned in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the same code). Under certain
conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenue may be recharacterized as deemed
dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case such non-deductible interest and
other assimilated revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax
Code at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid outside France in a Non-Cooperative State, unless such Non-Cooperative
State is referred to in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the French Tax Code, (ii) 30% if they are paid to non-French tax
resident corporate or other legal entities (it being noted according to the Draft French Finance Bill that such
withholding tax rate would vary in line with the reduction of the common rate of French corporate income tax
provided for by Article 219 I of the French Tax Code for fiscal years beginning as of January 1, 2020) or (iii)
12.8% in cases where the holder is a non-French tax resident individual, in each case subject to the more favorable
provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax
Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are
not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non-deductibility set out under Article 238 A of the French Tax
Code and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied
as a result of such non-deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of Notes, if the Issuer can prove
that the main purpose and effect of such issue were not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated revenues
to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

In addition, pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French administrative guidelines)
referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 no. 550 and 990, BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211 no. 70
and no. 80 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60-20150320 no. 10, an issue of Notes benefits from the Exception

342


-----

without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the main purpose and effect of such issue of Notes, and
accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbor”), if such Notes are:

  - offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State which is not a
Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration
or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

  - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system
_provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and the operation of such_
market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar
foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not
located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

  - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and
payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial
Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or
operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

The Notes issued pursuant to this Listing Prospectus qualify as debt securities under French commercial law.
Considering that: (i) as of the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange in Luxembourg, which does not qualify as a Non-Cooperative State, and such
market is operated by a market operator which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State and/or (ii) at the time of
their issue, the Notes will be admitted to the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, which are not located in a
Non-Cooperative State, the Notes will fall under the Safe Harbor.

**_Sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes_**

Pursuant to Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code, a holder of Notes who is not a resident of France for French
tax purposes and who does not hold its Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of
business in France, should not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains
realized on the sale, exchange or other disposal of Notes. As part of the on-going discussions on the Draft French
Finance Bill, it has been proposed to repeal Article 244 bis C of the French Tax Code for gains realized as from
January 1, 2020. Should this be eventually enacted, the abovementioned holder of Notes should still not be subject
to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realized on the sale, exchange or other disposal
of Notes.

**_Stamp duties_**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with a transfer of Notes, provided that such
transfers are not recorded in a deed registered with the French tax authorities and that the EU FTT does not become
applicable and except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary basis.

**_Certain general tax considerations—payments by a Note Guarantor_**

If a Note Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be subject
to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

343


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that
are deemed to hold the assets of such plans (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with
respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements,
including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that
an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA
Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such
as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as
“parties in interest”, within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding
the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a
prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. Non-US plans (as described
in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain “church
plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code), while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-US, state, local, federal or other laws, rules or regulations that are
substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (collectively, “Similar Law”).
Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need
for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exempted relief under any such law or regulations.

**_Prohibited Transaction Exemptions_**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether
such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or a
disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified
person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan
assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of
certain conditions, which may include the identification of the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire and/or
hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an “independent
qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to
investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an inhouse asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could provide an exemption from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of
these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction
involving the Notes.

Each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-US, governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law) should
consult with its legal adviser concerning the potential consequences to the Plan under ERISA, the Code or such
Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes.

**_Representations and Warranty_**

By its purchase of any Note, the purchaser and any subsequent transferee thereof will be deemed to have
represented and warranted that either: (i) it is not a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or non-US, governmental or church plan
subject to Similar Law or any entity whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the
meaning of Section 2510.3-101 of Title 29 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement, or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes
by such purchaser or transferee does not and will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section

344


-----

406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Law. Each purchaser and
subsequent transferee of a Note that is acquiring the Notes with the assets of any ERISA Plan represents, warrants
and acknowledges that a fiduciary is making the decision to invest in the Notes on its behalf and that such fiduciary
acknowledges and agrees that (1) no fee or other compensation will be paid directly to any of the Issuer, the initial
purchasers, the agents or any of their respective affiliates, or any fiduciary, participant or beneficiary of the ERISA
Plan, for the provision of investment advice (as opposed to other services) in connection with the ERISA Plan’s
acquisition of, or holding of an interest in, the Notes; (2) none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the agents or
other persons that provide marketing services, nor any of their respective affiliates, has provided, and none of
them will provide, impartial investment advice and they are not giving any advice in a fiduciary capacity, in
connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes, and (3) it has received and understands the disclosure
of the existence and nature of the financial interests contained in this Listing Prospectus and related materials.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering whether to purchase the Notes offered hereby
on behalf of or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transaction and whether an exemption would be
applicable to such transaction. Investors in the Notes offered hereby have exclusive responsibility for ensuring
that their purchase of the Notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code
or any similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes offered hereby by or to any Plan is in no respect
a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal
requirements with respect to investments by such Plans generally, or any particular Plan, or that such an
investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of France, which is a Member State of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) as modified
(the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which became fully effective on June 26, 2017 and applies within the
European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center
of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and
even conflicting views.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or COMI, of a “debtor
shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor
has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This
presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member
State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30)
provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a
Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and
supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU
insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar
terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in
particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or
has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI
is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which
courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations
where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main
insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any
proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be
secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor
situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be commenced
in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b)
the secondary insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor which is domiciled, habitually
resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the
establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State
in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori_

346


-----

_concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings_
of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State
which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise
the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets
of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings
have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary
further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

(b) for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of

the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners;

(c) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the

efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group;

(d) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

(e) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of

such insolvency registers.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and the registered office of the Issuer and of the Note
Guarantors is located in France; consequently, they could be subject to French court-assisted proceedings affecting
creditors, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within the scope of the EU Insolvency
Regulation). In addition, to the extent that the COMI of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor, or, in cases where the
EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of
the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, or they have an establishment in France, they could be
subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings, accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, _sauvegarde accélérée or_
_sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial_
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Pursuant to Article L. 721-8 of the French Commercial Code, specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or
insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the
companies under their control) (x) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (y) €40 million in turnover, (ii)
commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the
application of the EU Insolvency Regulation, or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply,
from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate
group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international
jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and to specific control
thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this
purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings
in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over
the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Note
Guarantees and limit the ability of the Security Agent to enforce corresponding security interests in the Note
Collateral.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard,
judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the
EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France would be subject to French
main insolvency proceedings and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in
another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings.
The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational
purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.

347


-----

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving the
debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and the
creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment
obligations and/or decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear
interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually
by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order
made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any
contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered
by the relevant judge.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course
of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings” below).

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable to
pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account
available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling
commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date,
which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the
hardening period (see below).

**_Court-assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an amicable agreement with the debtor’s
main creditors and stakeholders e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat_
_ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see “—_
_Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the_
court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors if any). They are carried out under the
aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under
the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire
_ad hoc are determined by the president of the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him_
or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors, it being noted that such mandataire ad hoc does not have
any coercive power. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual
and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept
it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred
from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the
proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the
relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above).
The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by him or her.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of_
a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above) or has not been insolvent
for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court
decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a
court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being
able to request a month extension so that its total duration can be up to five months). In case the debtor intends to
have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by
the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation
period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the
_conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners_

348


-----

that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness, it being noted that such
_conciliateur does not have coercive power. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated_
on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings
and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have
accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and creditors may not request
the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor.
Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right
to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French
Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay
or is suing for payment (including if such action was initiated prior to the opening of conciliation proceedings);
the judge will take its decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures
it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced
conciliation proceedings may, for the term of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved
as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation
proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to
pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being
taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the
Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to
obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a
judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request
of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose (which will be attended by the works council or employee
representatives, as the case may be) if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect
of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company
will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory
creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and
in addition:

  - the decision of approval by the relevant court, which should only disclose the existence of the
proceedings, the guarantees, security interests and liens as well as the amount benefitting from the socalled New Money Lien (see below), will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain
confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be that are
informed of the contents of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation
agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

  - creditors that, as part of the conciliation agreement or during the course of the conciliation proceedings,
provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor
(other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority
of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain
pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of
subsequent insolvency proceedings;

  - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization, the claims benefiting from the New Money
Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be written off and their payment date may not be
rescheduled, not even by the creditors’ committees (the powers of the bondholders general meeting in
this respect are the subject of debate);

  - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its
statutory auditors; and

  - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening
period (as defined below) (see “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization
_and judicial liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the_
final decision approving (homologation) the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud).

349


-----

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor,
appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord)
during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:

  - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement cannot be compounded;

  - the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace
period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as explained above; and

  - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect
to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from
grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the
court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. If
such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked.
Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with
respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or
prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will be entitled to recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet
the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated
safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the
matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the
debtor, in particular through a sale of one or several activities which could be implemented in the context of a
subsequent safeguard or a “plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented
in the context of subsequent judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with
certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the_ _conciliateur may be_
directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings after
consultation of the Public Prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing
contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or_
(ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement
of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors
in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific
legal consequences for the debtor. In particular, it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency
proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end
of the previous ones.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency
_Test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which_
the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard
proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies
where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during
an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings
and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up
to 18 months. The role of the court appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard
plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control
over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court appointed administrator. The
court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise
_ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all_
or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

350


-----

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative_
or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard
proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any
time during the observation period if the debtor becomes insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the
relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described below), if the approval
of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is
insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

  - the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i) (b), the court may
act upon its own initiative; and

  - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the Public Prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of
the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the
proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is
prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in
order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover
goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan
(including debt write-offs, debt rescheduling or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the
court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or_
prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million
or less.

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’
representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs, debt
rescheduling or debt-for-equity swaps proposed, as the case may be. Creditors are consulted individually or
collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether
the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, _provided that it is_
justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’
representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years
maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is
approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-forequity swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) made to them are
deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is
notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as
a controller (contrôleur) pursuant to Article L. 621-10 of the French Commercial Code.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde)
can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were submitted to
them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over
a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and claims
with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain
the same), but no cancellation of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s
individual acceptance.

351


-----

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting
the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the
amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial
maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount
of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the
uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor_
(commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150
employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the
consent of the supervising judge in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a draft safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees
which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the
judgment commencing the proceedings:

  - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions having a claim against the debtor and entities having
granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or the assignees of such claim or of a claim acquired
from a supplier) (the “credit institutions committee”); and

  - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims
of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the courtappointed administrator (the “major suppliers committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital
market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities (the
“bondholders general meeting”) will be established, in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of
whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or the bondholders
general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic (as opposed to a legal (ownership)) interest
therein will not itself be a member of the committee or the bondholders general meeting.

The proposed plan:

  - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

  - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

  - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring
the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where
applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also
prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the
committees and of the bondholders general meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan
is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and
gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not
permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may
be extended or shortened by the supervising judge, at the request of the debtor or the judicial administrator, but
may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds
of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court
appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or
total payment of its claim by a third party, as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed
administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors
committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the
president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed
administrator.

352


-----

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to
the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors
that are not members of the creditors’ committees or bondholders general meeting in accordance with the standard
consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify
that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable)
has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members
of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by either the creditors’ committees or the bondholders general
meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or
because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court-appointed
administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved
through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard
plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as
the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or an amendment of the by-laws, the court may
decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of
securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is
convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided
that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual
provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholders
meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public
Prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears
that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly
lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case- Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and_
unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to
those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar
position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or
relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local
administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant
relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments,
penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de
_sauvegarde financière accélérée)._

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to
“fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e. those:

  - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code;
or

  - that publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and
have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose
total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

If the debtor does not exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above), the court
shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

353


-----

To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor
must fulfil the following conditions:

  - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

  - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the proceedings;

  - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome; and

  - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going
concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its
adoption by the relevant committees (the credit institutions committee only for financial accelerated
safeguard proceedings) and the bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months
following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months
following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and
the bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom
the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts
(including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the
commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period
or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts).
Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance
with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security
administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts
will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committeebased consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde
_accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and_
any creditor that is a member of the credit institutions committee or the major suppliers committee, but not
bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “—Court-administered
_Proceedings—Safeguard—Committee-based consultation”), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing,_
since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial
one month period). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their
owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed
safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of it being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard
proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is
adopted following the same majority rules as in the committee-based consultation of standard safeguard
proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt write-offs and conversion of debt into equity capital
of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation
may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not
bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall
terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee
process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as
applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see below).

354


-----

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s
recovery is manifestly impossible. Within 45 days of becoming insolvent, the debtor, if it does not file for
conciliation proceedings (as discussed above), is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have
deliberately failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having
heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the
commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor
requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period,
upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (“contrôleur”) pursuant to Article L._
621-10 of the French Commercial Code, the Public Prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert
the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery
is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, any above controllers, the Public Prosecutor and the workers’
representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of
employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up
to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial
reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan with the contribution of the debtor), or the sale of
the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management
and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a
manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial
reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them,
are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor,
the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the Public Prosecutor or
at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation
of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the
proceedings is decided by the court.

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’
equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French
Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’
meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft
restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to
comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business as described below. Any third party (as construed under French insolvency
law) can present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the
meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local
employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid
harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern,
then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the Public Prosecutor (x) after the review of the
options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision

355


-----

commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the
company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

  - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the
reorganization plan; or

  - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or
part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and
holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting
rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the
company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders
have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously
by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be
set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to
hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization
plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is
generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial
liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent
the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent
the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment).
The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no
longer in charge of its management (although they remain in place).

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

  - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to manage
the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court
(three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will generally apply)
and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale of the business
plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to
present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchasers can, under certain conditions, cherrypick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save
exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is often at a
significant discount compared to their _in bonis market value. The court will indeed tend to favor a_
credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation
of jobs, over the payment of creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including
secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to
release their security interests. By way of exception:

    - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay remaining instalments due to creditors having granted
financing for the acquisition of assets acting as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale
of the business plan; and

    - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over
inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgagees of real estate assets) would be
entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore
in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless
reaching an agreement with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several
debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal
entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be
significantly less than their in bonis market value;

356


-----

  - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

    - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

    - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have
been received, (the formal authorization of the supervising judge being necessary to conclude the
sale agreement with the bidder); or

    - request, under the supervision of the supervising judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on
each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit
their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing
(procédure des plis cachetés). However the possibility to implement such process is questioned by
certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a sale of the business plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay
off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

  - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets;

  - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between
the remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before
the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier
than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation
proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period
(période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the
judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

  - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. These include essentially transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal
consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal
obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that
are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security
granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures
_conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to_
stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is
made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie)
that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such
amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d’insaisissabilité)._

  - Transactions which are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions
for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie
_attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that_
the party dealing with the debtor knew (or could not fail to know) that the debtor was insolvent at the
relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when
entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period risk in the case of safeguard or accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (assuming the proceedings are successful).

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial_**
**_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration of the
debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued
operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the
debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract,
_diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial_
_reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014,_
n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing
contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the
court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations
even though the debtor may have been in default (including in payment default), but on the condition that the
debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash
on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of
all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the
adoption of a “sale of the business plan” (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of
the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “sale of the business plan” (plan de
cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

  - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer
be compounded);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required for the
continued operation of the business);

  - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

  - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes
of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided
to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority
over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such
as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the
court-appointed administrator within one year of the end of the observation period;

  - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the
debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard
or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court
decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

    - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described
below);

    - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor;

    - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset – whether tangible or intangible, movable_
or immovable – is located (y) in another Member State within the European Union at the time of the
opening of the insolvency proceedings, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would
not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms
of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (z) in a State which is not a Member State of the
European Union, absent any recognition of the effect of the French insolvency proceedings therein;
or

358


-----

  - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en
_cours), will be required._

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope
of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the
ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also
file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two- or four- month period
referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during
the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with
the proceedings. Employees do not need to file a proof of claim in respect of their wage-related claims and are
preferred creditors under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’
representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim
with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of
claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also
file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the
claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors
or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail
themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in
the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part
in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a sale of the business plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its
creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor,
the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their
ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees (for the
super-privileged part of their claims), post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors
who benefit from a New Money Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State
(taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement
secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors.
This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a
retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard, judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held liable for the
losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and if
the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, (ii) interfered with the management of the debtor or (iii) obtained
security or guarantees which are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken
to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or
reduced by the court.

**_Rights in the Note Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Note_**
**_Collateral._**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Note
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable

359


-----

to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee
nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In
particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions)
that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres
_financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly_
established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by
each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the
relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of the
French entity which issued the securities which are pledged. In France, no lien searches are available for security
interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no
assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced following
a payment default or an acceleration resulting in a payment default and may only secure a creditor up to the
secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities
account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds
of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which
the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce
by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be
deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in
the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual
foreclosure. If the value of the Note Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as
so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Note Collateral. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, we purport to defer the payment of the _soulte to the earlier of (i) the date which is 12_
months after the date on which such foreclosure occurs and (ii) the date on which the relevant debt is considered
discharged in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Such deferral of the soulte has not been tested under
French law.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant
creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to
such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price
received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant
to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor
on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of
companies or groups of companies.

**_Parallel Debt - Trust_**

Under French law, prior to the recent reform of the security agent regime pursuant to Ordonnance n°2017-748 of
May 4, 2017, which came into force on October 1, 2017, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the
creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest
cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire)
under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq.
of the French Civil Code.

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents.
In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for
the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under
or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations.
Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any
payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the

360


-----

Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under
the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure
the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Note Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the
Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Note
Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms
(Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York
law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in
safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme
Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene
French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the
French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism.
Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French
courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be
effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited
to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a
Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such
a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a
security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Note Collateral created for the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders
of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Note Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the
holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of inter alios the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests
in the Note Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Note Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means
of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which
such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security
for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing
security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the
relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or
reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any
of the creditors of the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in
its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may
be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do
so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in
its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor
and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors

361


-----

(existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no
consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the
issuance of the Notes or the grant of the security interests in the Note Collateral, involved a fraudulent conveyance
that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of the
security interests in the Note Collateral could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared
unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such
successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes or the security interests in the
Note Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes or
the security interests in the Note Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held
liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor agreements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement,_
except for Articles L. 626-30-2, L. 626-32 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in
the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or reorganization plan which is put
to the vote of the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting takes into consideration (prend en
_compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the_
commencement of the safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent
referred to above (which, as at the date of this Listing Prospectus, has received no judicial interpretation), we
cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by French courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking
pledges over the Collateral located in France.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the
relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are
registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges
over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on
the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered.

The creation and enforcement of second ranking pledges over certain assets (such as receivables) has not been
tested before French courts, and there can be no assurance that second ranking pledges over such assets would be
upheld if tested. Accordingly, there is a risk that a second ranking pledge over such assets may be held void or
unenforceable by a French court.

**_Limitation on guarantees_**

As of the Issue Date, the Note Guarantors will be all incorporated under the laws of France.

In France, the enforcement of the Note Guarantees is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
under the applicable laws of France, to the extent that the granting of such a Note Guarantee is not in the grantor’s
corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such
guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory
laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary
duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

Further, the liabilities and obligations under the Note Guarantees of French Guarantors incorporated in France are
subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial
assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the_
provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce_ and French corporate
benefit rules ; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering
of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the benefit of each Note Guarantor through intercompany loans.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated November 7, 2019, the Issuer
has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase the Notes
from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the
initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be
varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States
may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are qualified broker-dealers under applicable law.
The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in
whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the
Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer and the Note
Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer that are
substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including
the date that is 30 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within
the United States to non-U.S. persons except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside
the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer
_restrictions”._

The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that they have:

  - only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Note Guarantors;
and

  - complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
them in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom, by us
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this Listing Prospectus or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Listing Prospectus nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Listing Prospectus
does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such
offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Listing Prospectus comes are advised
to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Listing
Prospectus and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information About this Listing Prospectus” and “Notice to
_Investors”._

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We intend to list the Notes on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit them for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof;
however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained.

363


-----

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A Distributor should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in
accordance with MiFID II, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition,
any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does
develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of
the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders
to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering
transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to
cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or
dealer when Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction
to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the
price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position,
and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above
market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities,
and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees
_and the Note Collateral— There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to_
_sell your Notes may be limited”._

These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it
would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on
which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued
at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no
later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management,
principal investment, hedging, real estate assets valuation, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in the future provide,
commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer, the
Note Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive,
customary fees and expenses. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders to our controlling

364


-----

shareholders, the companies Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris, as well as certain subsidiaries of CGP.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers are also lenders under our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and our Existing
EMTN Bonds and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering as a result of the repayment and
cancellation of our Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and the purchase of Existing EMTN Bonds through the
tender offer as described in “Use of Proceeds”. Moreover, Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel, an affiliate of
Crédit Industriel et Commercial S.A., one of the Initial Purchasers, is a joint-venture partner in Banque Casino.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its respective
affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge
their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist
of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Notes offered hereby. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities
and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are among the mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers have provided real estate valuation services to the Group, including valuation services that have formed
the basis for certain of the valuations of real estate assets of IGC described above in “Summary—IGC—Overview
_of Real Estate Assets”. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers have provided other advisory services to the_
Group, including in relation to the Latam Reorganization Transactions and the Asset Disposal Plan. Jean-Charles
Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CGP, is a former member of the board of directors of Natixis.

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers
registered under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser intends to effect any sales of the Notes
in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by FINRA
regulations. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of Notes within
the United States by a dealer, whether or not participating in the Offering, may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A of
the Securities Act and in connection with any applicable state securities laws.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or securities
laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes and the Note Guarantees offered hereby are being offered and sold only
(i) in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in, and in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, and (ii) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions as defined in, and in
reliance on, Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

You, by your acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer
and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are being offered for resale in a

transaction not involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that
the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (i) if in the future you decide
to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes, such Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or
otherwise transferred only (a) in the United States to a person whom you reasonably believe is a QIB in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (b) to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in a
transaction complying with Regulation S or (c) in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set out in paragraph (5) below in each case in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any state of the United States, and that (ii) you will, and each subsequent holder is required to,
notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from you of the resale restrictions referred to in (i) above.

(2) You are not an “affiliate” of the Issuer (as defined in Rule 144A), nor acting on its behalf, and

that you are either:

(i) a QIB, and are aware that any sale of Notes to you will be made in reliance on

Rule 144A and such acquisition of Notes will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB;
or

(ii) a non-U.S. person or purchasing for the account or benefit of a non-U.S. person, other

than a distributor, and in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

(3) You represent that you are not a “retail investor”. For the purposes of this paragraph, the

expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that

customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation; and

(iv) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of

sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

(4) You understand and acknowledge that:

(i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” (as defined in paragraph 4 above)
in the EEA: and

(ii) consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for

offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been

366


-----

prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

(5) You acknowledge that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or

the Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to you with respect to the offer or sale of any Notes, other than
the information contained in this Listing Prospectus, which Listing Prospectus has been delivered to you and upon
which you are relying in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that none
of the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of this Listing Prospectus.

(6) You have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as

you have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(7) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for

which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant
to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act.

(8) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are

purchasing the Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by the acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree,
to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes only (i) to the Issuer, the Note Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof,
(ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act, an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in any transaction not subject thereto, (iii) for so long
as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv) to a non-U.S. person pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United
States in compliance with Regulation S or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or
their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to our and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer, to require
that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing in the Indenture is completed and delivered by the transferor to
the Trustee.

(9) You represent and warrant that either (i) no portion of the assets used by you to acquire and

hold such Notes or interest therein constitutes assets of any “employee benefit plan” subject to Title I of the United
States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, any plan, individual retirement account
or other arrangement subject to Section 4975 of the United States Internal Revenues Code of 1986, as amended,
an entity whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plans, accounts or arrangements
or a governmental plan, non-U.S. plan or other plan not subject to the foregoing but that is subject to provisions
under any federal, state, local, non U.S. laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the
Code or (ii) the acquisition, holding and dispositions of the Notes or interest therein will not constitute or result
in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar
violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustees, the Security
Agent, the Principal Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, or the Initial
Purchasers or any of their affiliates is acting as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or
hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes or any interest therein.

(10) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following

effect:

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of France with its registered offices or principal places of business in
France. The Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with their registered offices and principal
places of business located in France (the “French Entities”). None of the directors, officers and other executives
of the French Entities are residents or citizens of the United States (the “Non-U.S. Individuals”). Furthermore,
most of the assets of the French Entities and the Non-U.S. Individuals are located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons
and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal or state securities laws. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within
France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims
connected with the Notes against the French Entities and/or French persons.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment
rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France
before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings
if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following
conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the
French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

  - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the
choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over
the matter;

  - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

  - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e.
those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment
should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there
is no proceeding pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having
the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the _res_
_judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in_
France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is not automatically granted by French courts and is subject
to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain
circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980
and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and
information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons),
which prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with
international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) and/or French procedural rules to
obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, the LIL can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from
French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated
by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the
application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as
determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Additionally, in an action brought in France on the basis of

372


-----

U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies
sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a
foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French nationals. Pursuant to
Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in
connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). Historically, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French
national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than
French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not
mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts
with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights
to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by
voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to
French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person
domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the
privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France,
regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party
to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent
jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be
binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing
an action before the French courts.

**LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION**

**Listing**

Application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and to admit them for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof, in accordance with the rules and
regulations of that exchange. Our organizational documents will be deposited at the registered office of the Issuer,
located at 1, cours Antoine Guichard, 42000 Saint-Étienne, France, where such documents may be examined and
copies obtained. They may be inspected by any interested person at the registered office of the Issuer.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, copies of the following documents in English may be inspected and obtained free of charge at the offices
of the Listing Agent during normal business hours on any weekday (public holidays excluded):

  - the organizational documents of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors;

  - the consolidated financial statements included in this Listing Prospectus;

  - our most recent audited consolidated financial statements, and any interim condensed consolidated
financial statements published by CGP;

  - the Indenture, which includes the Note Guarantees and the form of the Notes;

  - the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - the Security Documents.

The Issuer has named Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, Registrar, Security Agent
and Trustee and Banque Internationale à Luxembourg S.A. as Listing Agent. The Issuer reserves the right to vary
such appointments in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and, if so required by the internal rules and
regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, will publish a notice of such change of appointment in a
newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or on the
official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) or by any other means considered
equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

It is expected that the total expenses relating to the application for admission of the Notes to the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for admission of the Notes to trading on its Euro MTF Market will be
approximately €6,200 (excluding VAT and disbursements).

Application may be made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange to have the Notes removed from listing on the Euro
MTF Market, including if necessary to avoid any new withholding taxes in connection with the listing.

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON GROUP

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon ("the Company") is a French _société anonyme listed in compartment A of Euronext_
Paris. The Company and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as "the Group" or "the Casino Group". The
Company’s registered office is at 1, Cours Antoine Guichard, 42008 Saint-Étienne, France.

The interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2019 reflect the accounting position
of the Company and its subsidiaries as well as the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates. The Group
was informed by its main shareholder, Rallye, of the initiation of safeguard proceedings concerning Rallye and its
subsidiaries Cobivia and HMB, as well as Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris, as announced by those companies on
23 May 2019. The safeguard proceedings do not concern the Casino Group, its businesses or employees and have
no impact on the continued implementation of the Group’s current strategic plan (Note 2).

The consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon for the six months ended 30 June 2019 were
approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on 24 July 2019.

#### Note 1 Significant accounting policies

###### 1.1 Accounting standards

Pursuant to European Commission Regulation No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, the consolidated financial
statements of the Casino Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European
Union as of the date of approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors and applicable at 30 June
2019.

These standards are available on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/businesseconomy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting_en.

The interim consolidated financial statements, presented here in condensed form, have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting. They do not contain all the information and notes included in
the annual financial statements. They should therefore be read in conjunction with the Group’s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, which are available upon request from the Company’s
head office, or can be downloaded from the Group’s website, https://www.groupe-casino.fr/en/.

The accounting principles used to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months
ended 30 June 2019 are identical to those applied to the annual consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2018, with the exception of the accounting changes related to the following new standards and
interpretations applicable from 1 January 2019.

- IFRS 16 – Leases

- IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

- Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

- Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

- Amendments to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures

- IFRS Annual Improvements – 2015-2017 Cycle

The effects of applying IFRS 16 are presented in Note 1.3. The adoption of the other new standards has no
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### 1.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements 

**1.2.1** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the Group’s parent
company. The figures in the tables have been rounded to the nearest million euros and include individually rounded
data. Consequently, the totals and sub-totals shown may not correspond exactly to the sum of the reported
amounts.

**1.2.2** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses, as well as the
disclosures made in certain notes to the consolidated financial statements. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
assumptions, actual results may differ from the estimates. Estimates and assessments are reviewed at regular
intervals and adjusted where necessary to take into account past experience and any relevant economic factors.

The main judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the information available when the financial
statements are drawn up and concern the following:

  - classification and measurement of France Retail segment assets in accordance with IFRS 5 (Note3.2) ;

  - valuation of non-current assets and goodwill (Note 8);

  - assumptions used to measure deferred tax assets (Note 7);

  - recognition, presentation and measurement of the recoverable amounts of tax credits or taxes (mainly
ICMS, PIS and COFINS in Brazil) (Notes 5.1 and 11);

  - IFRS 16 transition method, notably the determination of discount rates and the lease term for the purpose
of measuring the lease liability for leases with renewal or termination options (Note 1.3);

  - provisions for risks (Note 11), particularly tax and employee-related risks in Brazil.


-----

###### 1.3 Changes in accounting methods

**1.3.1** **Impact on the consolidated financial statements**

The following tables show the impact on the previously published consolidated income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows,
resulting from:

  - full retrospective application of IFRS 16 – Leases (Note 1.3.2);

  - limited retrospective application at 1 January 2018 (cumulative catch-up without restating prior periods)
of IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies in Argentina. IAS 29 requires that the
statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary
economies should be (i) restated by applying a general price index so that they are stated in terms of
the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period, and (ii) converted into euros at the periodend exchange rate;
Since the Group applied IAS 29 from the second half of 2018 with retroactive effect at 1 January 2018,
the impacts of applying this standard in first-half 2019 solely concern published information for the first
six months of 2018;

  - the main impact of the final allocation of the purchase price for Sarenza, acquired in 2018, was the
recognition of the Sarenza trademark.

**Total equity and liabilities** **37,440** **5,339** **3** **42,781**

**1.3.2** **Impact of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 – Leases**

IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 and the related interpretations as from 1 January 2019 and removes the distinction
between operating and finance leases, introducing a single lessee accounting model and requiring lessees to
recognise assets (right to use the underlying leased asset for the estimated term of the lease) and liabilities
(lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments) for substantially all leases. Operating lease
expense in the consolidated income statement is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset presented in
“Cost of goods sold” or “Selling expenses”, and interest expense on the financial liability presented in “Other
financial expenses”. Previously, the Group classified most of its leases as operating leases and recognised
rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. No asset or liability was recognised except to reflect
any timing difference between the rental payment period and the period in which the related expense is
recognised.

Compared to IAS 17, applying IFRS 16 has a positive impact on EBITDA (as defined in Note 5.1) as well as, to
a lesser extent, on trading profit, and a negative impact on finance costs.


-----

Consolidated net profit may be reduced progressively over successive periods because total rental expense is
generally higher at the beginning of the lease and decreases over time, unlike the straight-line charge
recognised under the previous standard (IAS 17). Additionally, net cash from operating activities is higher as
cash outflows corresponding to the repayment of the principal amount of the lease liability and related interest
payments as classified within cash flows from financing activities.
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented on separate lines of the consolidated statement of
financial position. Lease liabilities are not included in the calculation of net debt, the definition of which remains
unchanged. Accordingly, applying IFRS 16 has the effect of decreasing net debt due to the restatement of
finance lease liabilities, which were included within “Borrowings and financial liabilities” under IAS 17.

The Group has decided to apply IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the retrospective transition approach, by
restating all comparative information presented in accordance with IAS 8 – _Accounting Policies, Changes in_
_Accounting Estimates and Errors._

The Group has chosen to apply the recognition exemptions in IFRS 16 concerning:
- short-term leases (less than 12 months); and
- leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (value of underlying leased asset less than €5,000).
Lease payments not included in the initial measurement of the financial liability (for example, variable lease
payments) are recorded in operating expense, together with payments for short-term leases and leases for
which the underlying asset is of low value.

The assets and finance lease liabilities previously classified under IAS 17 within property, plant and equipment
and borrowings and financial liabilities have been reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities,
respectively, except for those related to short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low
value.

Lease premiums previously classified within intangible assets have been reclassified to “Right-of-use assets”.
Right-of-use assets relating to lease premiums are not generally amortised and are tested for impairment
whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

Sale-and-leaseback transactions prior to 1 January 2019 have not been restated, in accordance with IFRS 16.

A net differed tax effect has been recorded for the difference between the right-of-use assets and the lease
liabilities within the scope of IFRS 16, as was previously the case for finance lease liabilities.

The lease term corresponds to the non-cancellable period, and takes account of the period covered by any
option to terminate or extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The Group
applies the position of the French accounting standard-setter (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC)
concerning the lease term to be applied to standard 3/6/9-year commercial leases and other similar leases. In
the absence of explicit guidance, the Group amortises leasehold improvements and the right of use of the
underlying leased asset over different periods. Aligning these amortisation periods would have a material impact
on the consolidated financial statements, which would be recognised retrospectively. The ESMA has requested
clarification from the IFRS Interpretation Committee on the interaction between the amortisation period of
leasehold improvements and fixtures that cannot be dissociated from the leased asset (within the meaning of
IAS 16) and the lease term (determined in accordance with IFRS 16), and whether these two periods should be
aligned. The Group will monitor any developments in this area during the second half of 2019.

The discount rate used to calculate the value of right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities is determined on a
country-by-country basis, depending on the lease term. It is calculated for each asset according to the lease
term, using the incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease.

The impacts on the consolidated statement of financial position at 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018 are
presented above, and mainly concern the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in respect of
operating property leases on stores and warehouses. The other leases restated by the Group chiefly concern
cooling systems, vehicles and logistics equipment.

#### Note 2 Significant events of the period

Significant events during the period are the following:

**Initiation of safeguard proceedings concerning the Casino Group’s reference shareholders Rallye and**
**Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris**

On 23 May 2019, the Casino Group’s controlling shareholder Rallye and its parent companies announced that they
had each requested and obtained the initiation of safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) for a sixmonth period which may be extended by 6-12 months by decision of the relevant commercial court. The
proceedings were initiated after the court acknowledged the financial difficulties experienced by the holding
companies. They result in the freez of these companies’ financial liabilities.

Each proceeding only concerns the entity for which it was initiated and none of them applies to either Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon or its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Casino Group continues to run its operations as usual and
remains focused on executing the strategic plan announced to the market in June 2018, including the €2.5 billion
disposal plan of non-strategic assets, a sharp reduction in the Group’s debt in France and the achievement of the
business objectives communicated to the market.

To date, the initiation of safeguard proceedings for Rallye has had two notable impacts at the level of Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon:
- Rating downgrades by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. On 28 May 2019, Standard & Poor's downgraded the
Group’s credit rating to B/negative watch (from BB/negative outlook). On 31 May 2019, Moody's downgraded
the Group’s rating to B1/negative outlook (from Ba3/negative outlook). These rating downgrades had no impact
on the cost or availability of Casino’s existing financial resources.
- A reduction in the outstanding amount under the commercial paper programme. Outstanding commercial paper
amounted to €167 million at 30 June 2019 compared with €450 million before the Rallye safeguard
proceedings were initiated.

The Casino Group has not observed any change in supplier payment terms or any reduction in its available
overdraft facilities.

As announced by Rallye and its holding companies on 12 July 2019, structured financing arrangements with certain
financial institutions are secured by pledges over the shares of their subsidiaries. These financial institutions would
have the option to exercise these share pledges during the safeguard proceedings (Article L. 211-40 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code [Code monétaire et financier]). Casino confirms that such transactions would have no
impact on the control held over Casino by Rallye and its holding companies. In addition, Casino reiterates that
should Rallye or its holding companies lose control over Casino, this would have no legal impact on Casino’s debt
and would not constitute an event of default, whether in respect of bank financing documentation or Casino’s bond
financing documentation.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk in normal or impaired market conditions is presented in Note 9.5 to
the interim consolidated financial statements. Together with its banking partners, the Group continuously examines
its various options to refinance or to extend the maturity of its bank and bond debt, especially following its recent
rating downgrades.

**Sale of Via Varejo**

In line with its long-term strategy to focus on developing its food retailing business, on 14 June 2019 GPA
completed the process begun on 23 November 2016 to sell its entire stake in its subsidiary, Via Varejo. The
transaction was carried out through a block sale on the market at the price of BRL 4.90 per share, representing a
total sale price of BRL 2.3 billion (€517 million). Taking into account the two total return swaps (TRS) entered into
during the first half of 2019, the total proceeds received from the sale of the stake in Via Varejo amounted to BRL
2.7 billion (€615 million). These transactions led to the recognition of a capital gain after tax of BRL 55 million (€12
million), presented under “Net profit from discontinued operations”. The sale decreased non-controlling interests by
€750 million (see note (vii) to the consolidated statement of changes in equity).

Excluding the gain on the sale of Via Varejo, net profit from discontinued operations, mainly corresponding to the
Via Varejo business between 1 January 2019 and the disposal date, amounted to €1 million.

**Disposal plan of non-strategic assets**

On 11 June 2018, the Group announced that it was launching an asset disposal plan to support ongoing
transformation of its business model and accelerate the deleveraging process in France. The plan relates to nonstrategic real estate and other assets identified by the Group with an initially estimated total realisable value of
€1 5 billion The plan objective was raised in March 2019 to €2 5 billion


-----

On 30 June 2019, transactions carried out under the plan amounted to €1,871 million, of which €1,105 million in
2018 (the sale of 15% of Mercialys through an equity swap for €213 million (Note 3.1.2), the acquisition by Tikehau
Capital and Bpifrance of shares in GreenYellow for €150 million and the sale-leaseback of Monoprix real estate
assets for €742 million). The main transactions in first-half 2019 included:
- The sale-leaseback on 8 March 2019 of 13 Géant Casino, 3 Hyper Casino and 10 Casino Supermarkets store
properties to funds managed by Fortress for a sale price of €392 million plus a variable component whereby
the Casino Group could receive up to an additional €150 million depending mainly on the future yield on the
properties sold; this variable component has not been recognised in the financial statements. The Group will
continue to operate the stores under leases representing annual rent of €32 million. The sale-leaseback
transaction generated a capital gain before tax of €15 million presented in “Other operating income”, taking into
account the impact of IFRS 16.
- The signing of an agreement with funds managed by companies affiliated with Apollo Global Management for
the sale-leaseback of 32 store properties (12 Géant Casino and 20 Monoprix and Casino Supermarkets stores)
worth €470 million. The operation is expected to be concluded by end of October 2019. The sale price is €374
million and is expected to include a positive variable component representing up to €110 million. These
properties are presented at 30 June 2019 in “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, for €338 million.
The Group expects to continue operating the stores under leases representing annual rent of €27 million.

In addition, following an agreement signed in February 2019 with Compass Group PLC, the Casino Group sold its
contract catering services subsidiary R2C at the end of June 2019. This transaction had no material impact on the
financial statements.

Lastly, on 22 July 2019 the Casino Group announced the signing of an agreement to sell Vindémia for €219 million
(Note 13).

**Closure and disposals of loss-making stores**

The Group continues to implement the plan announced in 2018 to close or dispose of loss-making stores. In firsthalf 2019, agreements were signed to sell 36 integrated stores (including 12 hypermarkets) for a combined
consideration of €191 million; as of 30 June 2019, the Group had completed the sale of 27 stores (including 8
hypermarkets), mainly in June, and received proceeds of €105 million.
In addition, the Casino Group announced on 24 July that it had signed agreements to sell 3 hypermarkets for a total
consideration of €42 million (Note 13).
Also, 56 loss-making integrated stores have been closed since 2018.
Together, these stores represented net sales of around €500 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €52 million.
All of these streamlining transactions gave rise to the recognition of a €67 million expense in "Other operating
expenses" for the six months ended 30 June 2019 (Note 6.5).

**Project to simplify the Casino Group’s structure in Latin America (Note 13)**

On 26 June 2019, the Board of Directors of GPA, a subsidiary of the Casino Group in Brazil, approved the
formation of an ad hoc committee of independent directors to study a project that would simplify the Casino Group’s
structure in Latin America.
The Board of Directors of Casino reviewed the project, which would include the following steps:
- an all-cash tender offer launched by GPA for 100% of Éxito’s shares, to which Casino would tender all of its
stake (55.3%);
- the acquisition by Casino of the shares held by Éxito in Segisor (which itself holds 99.9% of the voting rights
and 37.3% of the economic rights of GPA);
- the migration of GPA shares to the Novo Mercado B3 listing segment, with the conversion of preferred shares
(PN) into ordinary shares (ON) at an exchange ratio of 1:1, bringing an end to the existence of two classes of
shares and giving GPA access to a broader base of international investors.

The tender price offered by GPA and the acquisition price offered by Casino for the shares held by Éxito in Segisor
would include a premium on the current share prices.

After implementation of the project, the Casino Group would hold 41.4% of GPA, which would itself control Éxito
and its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Argentina.

This operation will be subject to the corporate approvals of the governance bodies of the three companies
concerned. As the transaction is in the project stage, it had no impact on the interim financial statements.

#### Note 3 Scope of consolidation

###### 3.1 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation 

**3.1.1 Franprix-Leader Price**

Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of 36 stores during the period from two master-franchisees, for a nonmaterial acquisition price. Only a small portion (€8 million) of the acquisition price was recognised in goodwill
due to the negative net worth of some of the acquired companies.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2019, the impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales,
trading profit and net profit would not have been material.

**3.1.2** **Mercialys TRS**

On 26 July 2018, in connection with the announced asset disposal plan, the Group reduced its stake in
Mercialys from 40.3% of the voting rights to 25.3% (i.e. 15% of the capital), through the block sale to a bank via
a total return swap (TRS). Under the terms of the transaction, the Group received immediate proceeds
amounting to €213 million before disposal costs (€209 million after disposal costs).

Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank.
Consequently, the Group’s number of shares remained unchanged at 31 December 2018. The underlying sale
was not recorded in the financial statements and a liability was recorded for €198 million corresponding to the
value of the shares not yet sold on the market (at the price sold to the bank). The sale of the shares and the
related capital gains or losses are recognised when the bank sells the shares on the market. The 1% of shares
sold by the bank over 2018 and recognised in the income statement was not material at 31[st] December 2018.

As of 30 June 2019, 50.4% of the shares underlying the TRS had been sold. A corresponding capital loss of
€13 million was recorded in "Other operating expenses" and the liability now stands at €125 million.

The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 32.7% interest in Mercialys at 30 June 2019 (39.2%
at 31 December 2018) on an equity-accounted basis, of which 7.5% corresponds to the shares not sold on the
market at that date by the bank.

In addition, the remaining portion of the shares unsold under the TRS continues to be classified as “Assets held
for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, recognised at their carrying amount for €59 million at 30 June 2019 (€114
million at 31 December 2018) (Note 3.2).

base, and Mercialys shares underlying the TRS for €59 million. At 31 December 2018, this line corresponded primarily to
stores and property assets for approximately €874 million (attributable to owners of the parent) relating to asset disposal
plans and optimisation of the store base, and Mercialys shares underlying the TRS for €114 million.

(i) The €129 million negative movement in 2018 mainly reflects the reclassification as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with
IFRS 5 of the shares underlying a total return swap (TRS) and not yet sold on the market, for €114 million. It also includes the
previously eliminated share of margin on transactions between Mercialys and the Group now recorded in trading profit for
€5 million following the sale on the market of Mercialys shares representing 1% of the capital that were included in the TRS.
(ii) The amount of €26 million in 2019 related to the reclassification of the share of losses from associates of Franprix-Leader
Price that exceeds the book value of the investments, when Franprix-Leader Price has an obligation to cover its share in the
losses of those associates. The amount of €54 million in 2018 mainly related to (i) the same type of reclassification concerning
the share of these losses from associates for an amount of €20 million; and (ii) and an amount of €20 million subscribed by
Franprix-Leader Price to the capital increase of a master-franchisee.

**3.3.2 Share of contingent liabilities of equity-accounted investees**

At 30 June 2019 and 31 December 2018, none of the Group’s associates or joint ventures had any material
contingent liabilities.

signed with Mercialys. These payments represented €27 million in first-half 2019 (first-half 2018:
71 leases for €26 million).
(ii) Including €574 million in fuel purchases from Distridyn and €229 million in goods purchases from CD Supply Innovation in
the first half of 2019 (first-half 2018: €576 million and €400 million respectively). The partnership with CD Supply
Innovation was unwound during the period.
(iii) Income of €463 million in first-half 2019 (first-half 2018: €519 million) also includes sales of goods by Franprix-Leader
Price and Distribution Casino France to master-franchisees accounted for by the equity method, for €352 million (first-half
2018: €440 million). It also includes income related to property development transactions with Mercialys reported under
“Other revenue” for €53 million in first-half 2019 (first-half 2018: €8 million), generating a margin of €30 million (Note 5.1).
The decline in Casino’s stake in Mercialys during the first half of 2019 led to the recognition of previously eliminated past
property development transactions.

#### Note 6 Activity data

###### 6.1 Seasonality of operations

Across all businesses, seasonal fluctuations on the income statement are minor in terms of net sales (first-half 2018
represented 49% of full-year 2018, or 48% based on the average 2018 exchange rate), but are more significant in
terms of trading profit (first-half 2018 represented 37% of full-year 2018, or 36% based on the average 2018
exchange rate).

These seasonal fluctuations have an even greater impact on the cash flows generated by the Group. The change in
working capital observed in the first half of the year is structurally negative as a result of the large payments made
to suppliers at the beginning of the financial year in return for purchases made to meet strong demand in December
of the previous year.

(i) The net gain on disposal of non-current assets in the first half of 2019 primarily concerned the France Retail segment.
(ii) The impairment loss recognised in first-half 2019 mainly concerns the France Retail segment and relates to the asset disposal plan.
(iii) The expense relating to the store optimisation plan in the France Retail segment, including employee costs, store closure costs,
inventory reduction costs and impairment totalled €67 million in first-half 2019 (of which €21 million corresponding to changes in
scope and €46 million to restructuring). Other changes in scope of consolidation mainly concern the France Retail segment. The
€33 million expense recorded first-half 2018 primarily concerned fees related to various projects for changes in the scope of
consolidation.
(iv) Excluding the impact of the store optimisation plan, restructuring provisions and expenses for first-half 2019 mainly concerned the
France Retail and Latam Retail segments for €28 million and €20 million, respectively. Restructuring expenses for first-half 2018
related chiefly to the France Retail segment for €49 million (including employee-related costs and store closure costs for €41 million,
and store conversion costs of €8 million) and to Latam Retail for €37 million.
(v) Provisions and expenses for litigation and risks represented a net expense of €43 million in first-half 2019, including €24 million for
tax risks at GPA. In the first half of 2018, the net expense of €16 million concerned the France Retail and Latam Retail segments in
the amounts of €6 million and €8 million respectively.

_Reconciliation of theoretical income tax expense to actual income tax expense_


(i) The reconciliation of the effective tax rate paid by the Group is based on the current French rate of 34.43% in 2018 and
32.02% in 2019.
(ii) In the first half of 2019, it related to the France Retail segment in the amount of €13 million. In the first half of 2018, it related
to the France Retail segment in the amount of €25 million.
(iii) In first-half 2019, this concerned mainly the E-commerce segment for -€15 million and the France Retail segment for -€8
million. In the first half of 2018, this concerned mainly the E-commerce segment in the amount of -€19 million.
(iv) Tax laws in some countries cap the deductibility of interest paid by companies. In France, since the 2012 amended Finance
Act, companies are required to add back 25% of interest expense to their taxable profit. The resulting income tax amounts
disclosed for the periods presented mainly concern French entities.
(v) France's third amended 2012 Finance Act introduced a competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE). This is a tax
credit (repayable from the end of the third year) of 6% in 2018 (9% for Vindémia) based on salaries equal to or less than
2.5x the French minimum wage. In first-half 2018, the Group recognised this CICE income of €46 million as a reduction of
its employee benefits expense. The CICE has been abolished with effect from 1 January 2019 and replaced by a reduction
in social security contributions.
(vi) This concerns dividends paid by Brazilian subsidiaries in the form of interest on equity.
(vii) Corresponding to taxation of intra-group dividends.

#### Note 8  Goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and right-of-use assets

Acquisitions of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment property totalled €487 million in
first-half 2019, compared with €470 million for the same period in 2018. In addition, right-of-use assets recognised
in first-half 2019 in respect of new leases amounted to €492 million versus €449 million in the prior-year period.

The Group carried out a review of goodwill and other non-current assets at 30 June 2019 to determine whether
there was any evidence of impairment, as defined in the notes to the 2018 consolidated financial statements.
Impairment charges on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and right-of-use
assets were recognised in a total amount of €40 million for the period (Note 6.5), mainly in relation to the France
Retail segment.

Concerning goodwill, the main tests carried out on CGUs with impairment indicators concerned the Argentina
segment; those tests did not result in the recognition of an impairment loss at 30 June 2019.

(i) Financial assets recognised at fair value are generally measured using standard valuation techniques. If their fair value cannot be
determined reliably, they are not included in this note.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments are valued (internally or externally) on the basis of the widely used valuation techniques for this
type of instrument. Valuation models are based on observable market inputs (mainly the yield curve) and counterparty quality.
Derivatives held as fair value hedges are almost fully backed by borrowings.
(iii) The fair value of bonds is based on the latest quoted price on the reporting date.
(iv) The fair value of other borrowings has been measured using other valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method,
taking into account the Group's credit risk and interest rate conditions at the reporting date.
(v) The fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests is measured by applying the contract's calculation
formulas and is discounted, if necessary. These formulas are considered to be representative of fair value and notably use net
profit or sales multiples.

###### 9.5 Liquidity risk

As described in the notes to the 2018 consolidated financial statements, the Group’s liquidity policy is to ensure
that it has sufficient liquid assets to settle its liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market
conditions.

On 23 May 2019, the Casino Group’s controlling shareholder Rallye and its parent companies announced that
they had each requested and obtained the initiation of safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) for a
six-month period which may be extended by 6-12 months by decision of the relevant commercial court. The
proceedings were initiated after the court acknowledged the financial difficulties experienced by the holding
companies. They have the effect of freezing these companies’ financial liabilities.

Each proceeding only concerns the entity for which it was initiated and none of them applies to either Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon or its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Casino Group continues to run its operations as usual.

To date, the initiation of safeguard proceedings for Rallye has had notably two impacts at the level of Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon:
- Rating downgrades by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. On 28 May 2019, Standard & Poor's downgraded the
Group’s credit rating to B/negative watch (from BB/negative outlook). On 31 May 2019, Moody's downgraded
the Group’s rating to B1/negative outlook (from Ba3/negative outlook). These rating downgrades had no
impact on the cost or availability of Casino’s existing financial resources.
- A reduction in outstanding amountunder the commercial paper programme. Outstanding commercial paper
amounted to €167 million at 30 June 2019 compared with €450 million before the Rallye safeguard plan was
initiated.

The Casino Group has not observed any change in supplier payment terms or any reduction in its available cash
facilities (overdrafts).

In addition, together with its banking partners, the Group continuously examines its various options to refinanceor
to extend the maturity of its bank and bond debt, especially following its recent rating downgrades.

The main liquidity risk management methods consist in:
- diversifying sources of financing to include capital markets, private placements, banks (confirmed and
unconfirmed facilities) and discounting facilities;
- diversifying financing currencies to include the euro, the Group's other functional currencies and the
US dollar;
- maintaining a level of confirmed financing facilities significantly in excess of the Group’s liabilities at all times;
- limiting the amount of annual repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule;
- managing the average maturity of financing facilities and, where appropriate, refinancing them before they fall
due.

The liquidity analysis is performed both at the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon holding company level (taking into
account the cash pool operated with all controlled French subsidiaries) and for each of the Group's international
subsidiaries.

In addition, the Group carries out non-recourse receivables discounting without continuing involvement, within the
meaning of IFRS 7, as well as reverse factoring.

Most of the Group’s debt is carried by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and is not secured by collateral or any
secured assets. Financing is managed by the Corporate Finance department. The main subsidiaries (GPA,
Monoprix and Éxito) also have their own financing facilities, which are not secured by collateral or any security
interests in assets (except for GPA loans from BNDES totalling €7 million as at 30 June 2019 that are secured by
security interests in the assets) and are not guaranteed by Casino.

All subsidiaries submit weekly cash reports to the Group and all new financing facilities require prior approval from
the Corporate Finance department.

As at 30 June 2019, the Group’s liquidity position comprised:
- confirmed, undrawn lines of credit for a total of €3,212 million (of which €2,719 million for France);
- available cash of €3,195 million (Note 9.1).

**Total** **225** **2,644** **2,869** **150**

(i) Syndicated credit lines comprise a €1,200 million line expiring in February 2021 and a USD 750 million line expiring in
July 2022. Interest is based on Euribor (drawdowns in euros) or US Libor (drawdowns in US dollars) for the drawdown period
plus a spread that depends on the amount borrowed and the Group's net debt/EBITDA ratio.
(ii) Interest on the bilateral credit lines is based on the Euribor for the drawdown period plus a spread. In some cases, the spread
varies depending on the amount borrowed (lines totalling €240 million) and/or the Group's net debt/EBITDA ratio (lines
totalling €250 million). For one line, the spread is partially indexed to the Group's Sustainalytics CSR rating.
(iii) Interest on these confirmed bank credit lines is based on the Euribor for the drawdown period plus a spread. The spread
varies depending on the amount borrowed and/or the net debt/EBITDA ratio.

The only covenant for these credit lines is the consolidated net debt/EBITDA ratio (3.5x for the most restrictive,
except for the Monoprix credit lines which are subject to a covenant related to Monoprix’s net debt/EBITDA ratio).
Compliance with the covenant is tested annually based on the ratio at 31 December.

Bonds issued by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon totalled €5,338 million at 30 June 2019, of which €1,171 payable
within one year.

As announced by Rallye and its holding companies on 12 July 2019, structured financing arrangements with certain
financial institutions are secured by pledges over the shares of their subsidiaries. These financial institutions would
have the option to exercise these share pledges during the safeguard proceedings.
Casino confirms that:
- Such transactions would have no impact on the control held over Casino by Rallye and its holding companies.
- Should the exercise of these pledges lead to a loss of control over Casino by Rallye or its holding companies,
this would have no legal impact on Casino’s debt and would not constitute an event of default, whether in
respect of bank financing documentation or Casino’s bond financing documentation.

As a matter of fact:
i. Most of Casino’s bank financing documentation contains change of control clauses. The notion of change of
control is not defined as the loss of control over Casino by Rallye or its holding companies, but as the
acquisition of control over Casino by a third party (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce), other than Rallye and its affiliates, whether acting alone or in concert.
Activation of the change of control clauses would trigger the early redemption of loans or the cancellation of
confirmed credit lines at the individual discretion of each lender.

ii. Change of control clauses are included in all of Casino’s bond financing documentation, except for the
documentation relating to the €600 million deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI) issued in 2005, which
contains no such clause. Change of control is established when two criteria are met:
   - A third party, other than Rallye and its affiliates, acting alone or in concert, acquires shares conferring
more than 50% of Casino's voting rights; and
   - This change of control directly triggers a downgrade of Casino’s long-term credit rating (by at least one
notch in the event that Casino’s rating is not investment grade).

Should the acquisition of control over Casino by a third party lead to a rating downgrade for Casino, the
consequences on Casino’s bond financing would be as follows:
    - For senior bonds, representing a cumulative nominal amount of €5,338 million at 30 June 2019, each bond
investor would be entitled to request from Casino the early redemption of all their bonds at par.
###### - For €750 million worth of TSSDI issued in 2013, the interest would be raised by an additional spread of 5%
per annum and Casino would be entitled to buy back all of the bonds at par.

At 30 June 2019, share capital amounted to €165,892,132 (31 December 2018: €167,886,006) and comprised
108,426,230 ordinary shares issued and fully paid at that date (31 December 2018: 109,729,416 shares). The
change was mainly due to the cancellation of 1,303,186 shares, approved by the Board of Directors on 13 June
2019.
At 30 June 2019, a total of 831,617 shares were held in treasury, representing €29 million (31 December 2018:
961,761 shares representing €33 million). In addition, 455,000 treasury shares were held under the liquidity
agreement at that date, representing €16 million (31 December 2018: 0 shares).
In total, 1.3 million treasury shares were held by the Group at 30 June 2019, representing €46 million.

Purchases and sales of treasury shares during first-half 2019 led to a €58 million reduction in equity, also
corresponding to the net cash outflow for the period (of which €40 million in respect of shares purchased by Casino
for cancellation and €18 million reflecting the movement in the number of treasury shares held under the liquidity
agreement between 31 December 2018 and 30 June 2019).

###### 11.3 Contingent assets and liabilities

In the normal course of its business, the Group is involved in a number of legal or arbitration proceedings with third
parties or with the tax authorities in certain countries (mainly involving GPA – see below).

As stated in Note 3.3.2, no associates or joint ventures have any significant contingent liabilities.

- **Arbitration between GPA and Península**

On 12 September 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro Península
("Península") in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related to leasing
agreements concerning stores owned by Peninsula and operated by GPA. The agreements have a duration of
20 years as from 2005 and are renewable for another 20-year period at the sole discretion of GPA. They set out the
method for calculating rental charges.
Despite the discussions concerning application of the lease terms, the request for arbitration has no impact on the
operation of the leased stores, which is contractually guaranteed. At this stage of the arbitration process, it is not
possible to make a reasonable estimate of the related risk. Based on the opinion of its legal advisors, the Company
considers as possible the risk of an unfavourable ruling by the arbitral tribunal.

- **Proceedings brought by the DGCCRF against AMC and INCAA and investigations by the**
**French and European competition authorities**

On 28 February 2017, the French Ministry of the Economy, represented by the Department of Competition Policy,
Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), brought an action against Casino in the Paris Commercial Court.
The case involves a series of credit notes totalling €22.2 million issued in 2013 and 2014 by 41 suppliers. The
DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned together with a fine of €2 million.
Also, on 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and its parent companies Intermarché and
Casino, were prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices that allegedly took place in
2015 against 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a fine of €2 million.
The proceedings in both cases are still in progress. The Group considers that it complied with the applicable
regulations during negotiations with the suppliers concerned by both sets of proceedings. Consequently, no
provision has been set aside for these matters.

Moreover, the Group is subject to regular inquiries by the French and European competition authorities.
In early February 2017, representatives of France’s Competition Authority raided the premises of Vindémia
Logistique and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply and
distribution activities on Reunion Island.
At this stage, the Competition Authority has not issued any complaint and the Casino Group’s application contesting
the legitimacy of the raids is still pending. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of the
investigation.

At the end of February 2017, representatives of the European Commission raided the premises of Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon Achats Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino
Achats (INCA-A), in connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts
for the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer
goods to consumers.

In May 2019, representatives of the European Commission conducted additional raids of the premises of the same
companies (except for INCA-A, which has since ceased operations and is in the process of being liquidated).


-----

The European Commission has not issued any complaint at this stage. Applications filed by the Casino Group to
contest the legitimacy of the European Commission’s first series of raids are still pending before the General Court
of the European Union and the Casino Group also intends to contest the legitimacy of the second series of raids
before the same court. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of this matter.

In June 2018, after giving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, the French
Competition Authority launched an informal investigation into the creation of joint purchasing organisations in the
food retailing sector. The investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing organisation set up
between Auchan, Casino, Metro and Schiever. The investigation is still in progress.

- **GPA tax, social and civil contingent liabilities**

**(€ millions)** **30 June 2019** **31 December 2018**

INSS (employer’s social security contributions) 103 95

IRPJ - IRRF and CSLL (corporate income taxes) 233 224

PIS, COFINS and CPMF (VAT and similar taxes) 458 447

ISS, IPTU and ITBI (service tax, urban property tax and tax on property
34 34
transactions)

ICMS (state VAT) 1,385 1,329

Civil litigation 96 115

**Total** **2,308** **2,244**

GPA employs consulting firms to advise it in tax disputes, whose fees are contingent on the disputes being settled
in GPA’s favour. As at 30 June 2019, the estimated amount was €43 million (31 December 2018: €38 million).

Moreover, Casino has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax
adjustments received from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,386 million at 30 June 2019
(31 December 2018: BRL 1,317 million), including penalties and interest. Under the terms of the guarantee, Casino
has undertaken to indemnify GPA for 50% of any damages incurred, provided those damages are definitive. Based
on the commitment given by Casino to its subsidiary, the risk exposure amounts to BRL 693 million (€159 million)
31 December 2018: (BRL 658 million, representing €148 million). As the risks of liability are only considered
possible, Casino has not recognised a provision in its financial statements for this amount.

- **GPA contingent assets**

Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base

Since the adoption of non-cumulative regime to calculate PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has challenged the
right to deduct ICMS taxes from the calculation basis for PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by
a Brazilian federal supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the
PIS and COFINS tax base. Based on the STF’s ruling and the opinion of its internal and external advisors, GPA
considered that the probability of having to settle the amounts deducted in prior periods was low. It therefore
reversed in first-half 2017 the corresponding provisions set up in prior periods for an amount of BRL 117 million
(€32 million).

Since the supreme court’s ruling on 15 March 2017, the procedure has continued in line with the expectations of
GPA and its advisors, without GPA’s judgement being called into question concerning the reversal of the
provisions, although the court has not yet handed down its final decision. GPA and its external legal advisors
believe that this decision concerning the application method will not limit its rights under the legal proceedings
brought since 2003 which are still in progress. However, an asset cannot be recognised for the tax credits until all
the stages in the procedure have been completed. Based on the information available as of 30 June 2019, GPA
estimates that these tax credits represent a potential asset of BRL 1,400 million (€322 million) for its Retail
business.


-----

#### Note 12 Related-party transactions

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon is controlled by Rallye, which in turn is owned by Foncière Euris. At 30 June 2019, the
Rallye group held 52.37% of the Company's capital and 61.74% of the voting rights (based on the actual number of
voting rights held excluding treasury shares).

The Company has relations with all of its subsidiaries in its day-to-day management of the Group. The Company
and its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice and
assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris
(provision of staff and premises). These relations have not changed compared with the previous period. The
amount expensed over the period in relation to these agreements with Casino and its subsidiaries totalled
€1.9 million, of which €1.6 million for strategic advisory services and €0.3 million for the provision of staff and
premises.

The main transaction in the first half of the year between Casino Group consolidated companies and the
Rallye Group was the payment of a dividend for 2018 in an amount of €88 million.

In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities, Casino
and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys (Note 3.3.3).

Relations with other related parties, including remuneration of managers, remained comparable to those of financial
year 2018, and there have been no unusual transactions, in terms of either nature or amount, during the period.

#### Note 13 Subsequent events

**Completion of the sale of 8 stores in the France Retail segment**

Pursuant to the purchase agreements signed in January and February with Leclerc members and Lidl, the Casino
Group announced on 2 July 2019 the completion of the sale of 8 stores, including 3 hypermarkets, for which it
received a total consideration of €39 million.

**Agreement signed with GBH to sell Vindémia**

On 22 July 2019, the Casino Group and GBH announced the signing of a unilateral purchase agreement with a
view to the sale of Vindémia for an enterprise value of €219 million. The transaction is expected to be completed
after consultation with employee representative bodies and is subject to approval by the French Competition
Authority.

**Signing of new purchase pledges for the sale of 3 hypermarkets**

As part of its strategy to dispose of or close loss-making stores, the Casino Group announced on 24 July 2019 that
it had signed new unilateral purchase pledges with the aim of selling 3 Géant Casino hypermarkets representing a
total amount of €42 million (Note 2). Together, these stores generated net sales of approximately €76 million in
2018 for a trading loss of around €2 million. The transactions are expected to be completed at the end of 2019,
after the prior consultation of employee representatives and fulfilment of the customary conditions precedent.

**Project to simplify the Casino Group’s structure in Latin America**

On 27 June 2019, a project was announced to simplify the Group’s structure in Latin America, notably by combining
all of its activities in the region within GPA and migrating GPA shares to the Novo Mercado.
After the project had been studied by a committee of independent directors, on 24 July 2019, GPA’s Board of
Directors approved the launch of an all-cash tender offer for Éxito shares at a price of COP 18,000. The offer will be
filed by GPA once Éxito has approved the agreements giving Casino exclusive control over Segisor (the holding
company that controls GPA) and allowing Casino to acquire Éxito’s stake in Segisor at a price that values GPA at
BRL 109 per share.
On the same day, Casino’s Board of Directors approved the purchase offer at a price of BRL 109 per share, which
was submitted to Éxito’s Board of Directors for review.

 Statutory Auditors’ Review Report on the Half-yearly Financial Information _______

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders’ meeting
and in accordance with the requirements of article L.451-1-2 III of the French
Monetary and Financial Code ("Code monétaire et financier"), we hereby report
to you on:

- the review of the accompanying condensed half-yearly consolidated financial
statements of CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON, for the period from 1 January to
30 June 2019;

- the verification of the information presented in the half-yearly management
report.

These condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Board of Directors. Our role is to express a conclusion on
these financial statements based on our review.

**I-** **Conclusion on the financial statements**

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in
France. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries,
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than
an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.

F-41


-----

_CASINO,_ _GUICHARD-PERRACHON_ _2/2_

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the accompanying condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements
are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 -standard of
the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial
information.

Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw your attention to the matters set out
in Note 1.3 “Changes in accounting methods” to the condensed half-yearly
consolidated financial statements, which describes the methods of implementation
and the impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16 Leases, and in Note 2
“Significant events” and Note 9 “Liquidity risk” of the Casino Group, particularly in
the context of the safeguard procedures initiated by the controlling shareholders,
the companies Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris.

**II- Specific verification**

We have also verified the information presented in the half-yearly management
report on the condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements subject to
our review. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and
consistency with the condensed half-yearly consolidated financial statements.

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON GROUP

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon ("the Company") is a French _société anonyme listed in compartment A of Euronext_
Paris. The Company and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as "the Group" or "the Casino Group". The
Company’s registered office is at 1, cours Antoine Guichard, 42008 Saint-Étienne, France.

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 reflect the accounting situation of the
Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures.

The 2018 consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon were approved for publication by the
Board of Directors on 13 March 2019.

#### Note 1 Significant accounting policies

###### 1.1 Accounting standards

Pursuant to European Commission regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, the consolidated financial statements of
the Casino Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union as of the date of
approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors and applicable at 31 December 2018.

These standards are available on the European Commission’s website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economyeuro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting_en

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in all periods presented, after taking account of
the new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations listed below, and the application of IAS 29
to Libertad as from 1 January 2018 following the classification of Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy
(Note 1.3.3).

**Standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted by the European Union and**
**mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2018**

The European Union has adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which must be applied by
the Group for its financial year beginning on 1 January 2018:

- IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments

- IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

- Amendments to IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
The effects of applying IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 and the amendments to IFRS 2 are presented in Note 1.3.

The following texts have no material impact on the Group’s financial statements:

- _IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration_
This interpretation is applicable either retrospectively or prospectively. IFRIC 22 provides guidance on interpreting
IAS 21 – The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. It clarifies the exchange rate to be used for advance
consideration.

- _Amendments to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property_
These amendments are applicable on a prospective basis. They provide guidance on transfers to or from investment
property. They also clarify that the list of evidence of a change of use is a non-exhaustive list of examples.

- _IFRS Annual Improvements – 2014-2016 cycle_
The main standard concerned is IFRS 12 – _Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. These amendments are_
applicable on a retrospective basis. They clarify that IFRS 12 also applies to interests in subsidiaries, joint
arrangements and associates classified as “held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 (except for the requirement to
disclose summary financial information which does not have to be applied).


-----

###### 1.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements 

**1.2.1 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, with the exception of
the following:

- assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, which are measured at fair value in accordance with
IFRS 3;

- derivative financial instruments and financial assets, which are measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities hedged by a fair value hedge which would otherwise be measured at cost are adjusted for
changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros. The figures in the tables have been rounded
to the nearest million euros and include individually rounded data. Consequently, the totals and sub-totals shown may
not correspond exactly to the sum of the reported amounts.

**1.2.2 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses, as well as the
disclosures made in certain notes to the consolidated financial statements. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
assumptions, actual results may differ from the estimates. Estimates and assessments are reviewed at regular
intervals and adjusted where necessary to take into account past experience and any relevant economic factors.

The main judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the information available when the financial
statements are drawn up and concern the following:

  - classification and measurement of Via Varejo's net assets, assets within France Retail segment and
Mercialys shares in accordance with IFRS 5 (Note 3.5);

  - valuation of non-current assets and goodwill (Note 10.5);

  - recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets (Note 9);

  - recognition, presentation and measurement of the recoverable amounts of tax credits or taxes (mainly
ICMS, PIS and COFINS in Brazil) (Notes 5.1, 6.9 and 13);

  - provisions for risks (Note 13), particularly tax and employee-related risks in Brazil.


-----

###### 1.3 Changes in accounting methods

**1.3.1 Impact of first-time adoption of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

IFRS 15 defines the principles for recognising revenue and replaces IAS 18 – Revenue, IAS 11 – Construction
_Contracts and all related interpretations. The standard defines a single model for recognising revenue, in_
five steps. It introduces new concepts and principles regarding the recognition of revenue, in particular the
identification of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price for contracts with multiple
performance obligations.

The Group has decided to apply IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 under the full retrospective approach, by restating
comparative information. In view of the nature of the Group’s businesses, the application of the standard had no
material impact on the revenue and trading profit previously published by the Group.

Adoption of IFRS 15 has mainly led to reclassifications between net sales, other revenue, cost of goods sold and
selling expenses. This mainly concerns certain services provided to suppliers, certain promotional offers granted
directly by suppliers to end-customers, agent/principal qualifications in certain contracts and the presentation of
rental revenue. Retrospective application of IFRS 15 to the 2017 financial statements led to a €332 million
decrease in net sales and a €30 million decrease in trading profit (including €19 million in the France Retail
segment and €10 million in the E-commerce segment) compared to the previously reported amounts.

The amended accounting policy applied to revenue is presented in Note 6.

**1.3.2 Impact of the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments**

IFRS 9 defines new principles covering the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the
recognition of impairment provisions for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting.

The Group has applied IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2018 by recording the cumulative impact in opening equity at
the transition date. The main individually non-material changes resulting from the application of IFRS 9 are as
follows:

  - In line with the new impairment model for financial assets (including contract assets), incurred losses
recorded under IAS 39 have been replaced by lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has applied
the simplified model for all these assets, in particular receivables from franchisees and tenants. With
respect to continuing operations excluding equity-accounted investees, application of the new model led
to a €51 million increase in provisions for asset impairment and a €35 million reduction in equity, net of
tax.

  - Credit card receivables (Brazil) have been classified as debt instruments at fair value through other
comprehensive income, resulting in a €3 million reduction in trade receivables and a €2 million reduction
in equity.

  - Equity instruments previously classified as “Available-for-sale financial assets” have been reclassified
mainly as equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

  - Bond swaps have been restated, leading to a €19 million increase in debt and a €15 million reduction in
equity, net of tax.

  - With respect to equity-accounted investees (Mercialys, Banque du Groupe Casino and FIC), an
€11 million reduction in equity, net of tax was recognised against equity-accounted investees, mainly due
to the application of the new impairment model for financial assets.

  - With respect to Via Varejo’s discontinued operations, a €47 million reduction in equity, net of tax was
recognised against assets held for sale, as a result of the application of the new impairment model for
consumer finance receivables and to the classification of credit card receivables as debt instruments at
fair value through other comprehensive income.

The table below shows the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new categories used as from
1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 for each class of financial assets. The financial liability categories are unchanged
and are therefore not presented.

(ii) The original carrying amount and the new carrying amount under IFRS 9 of Via Varejo’s debt instruments (reclassified as
“Assets held for sale” and not included in the table above) represent €421 million and €405 million, respectively.

The new accounting principles applicable to financial instruments are presented in Note 11.

**1.3.3 Impact on the consolidated financial statements**

The following tables show the impact on the previously published consolidated income statement, statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows
resulting from:

  - the first-time application of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Note 1.3.1);

  - application of IFRS 9 – _Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018 (Note 1.3.2); as permitted by the_
standard, the Group has opted not to restate comparative information.

  - prospective application of the amendments to IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment: the impact consists in the
reclassification in non-controlling interests at 1 January 2018 of a €5 million debt corresponding to
withholding taxes due on stock option plans in Brazil;

  - limited retrospective application at 1 January 2018 (cumulative catch-up without restating 2017) of IAS
29 – _Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies in Argentina. IAS 29 requires that the_
statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary
economies should be (i) restated by applying a general price index so that they are stated in terms of the
measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period, and (ii) converted into euros at the period-end
exchange rate.

Moreover, certain changes have been made to the presentation of the consolidated income statement in
connection with the application of IFRS 15. These changes concern (i) the addition of a new indicator, “Total
revenue”, representing the sum of “Net sales” and “Other revenue”, (ii) the reclassification of the cost of property
development and property trading activities and changes in related inventories from “Selling expenses” to “Cost of
goods sold”, and (iii) reclassifications between “Net sales” and “Other revenue” of various items including:

  - rental revenues, which are now reported under “Other revenue”;

  - franchising and service fees billed to franchisees, which are now reported under “Net sales”.
The new presentation has been applied retrospectively, by restating 2017 comparative information on the same
basis.

#### Note 2 Significant events of the year

Significant events of the year are the following:

  - **Planned disposal of Via Varejo**

On 23 November 2016, the Group announced that it had approved GPA’s decision to start negotiations for the
sale of its stake in its subsidiary Via Varejo, in line with its long-term strategic refocusing on the food retailing
business.
Throughout 2018, GPA actively sought to sell the company to strategic investors. However, due to external
factors that were beyond GPA’s control, related mainly to the macro-economic environment in Brazil, no potential
buyer had been found as of 31 December 2018. While continuing the process of seeking out potential buyers, on
21 December 2018, GPA’s Board of Directors authorised management to explore alternative solutions to enable
the sale to be completed before 31 December 2019, including by selling the Via Varejo shares in a series of
transactions on the stock market.

The process to transfer all Via Varejo shares to the New Market segment of the B3-Brasil Bolsa Balcão stock
market was completed in November 2018.

In this context, at the end of December 2018, GPA signed an agreement for the sale of 50 million Via Varejo
ordinary shares (3.86% of the capital) through a total return swap (TRS) with a leading financial institution with the
purpose of subsequently selling the shares on the market over a period ending at the latest on 30 April 2019. The
sales were completed ahead of this date, with the last transaction carried out on 20 February.

The operation had no impact on the control or governance of Via Varejo. As of 31 December 2018, because the
TRS did not meet the requirements for derecognition under IFRS 9, the underlying sale was not recorded in the
accounts and a liability was recorded for the €49 million received from the counterparty (Notes 11.2.2 and 11.2.4).
As at 31 December 2018, GPA held 39.4% of Via Varejo’s voting rights and 43.23% of the shares.

Therefore, the sale of Via Varejo in 2019 is considered highly probable, and in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non_current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations:_
- the assets and liabilities held for sale are reported on a separate line of the consolidated statement of
financial position (Note 3.5.1);
- Via Varejo's net profit and cash flows for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 are reported on
separate lines in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows;
- Via Varejo has been excluded from tables in the notes, in particular those relative to lease commitments
(Note 7.2) and GPA's contingent liabilities (Note 13.3). If necessary, specific information for Via Varejo is
provided in a footnote.

Pursuant to the authorisation given by its Board of Directors on 20 February 2019, GPA has contracted a second
total return swap for 40 million Via Varejo shares (see note 15).

  - **Bond issue**

On 24 January 2018, Casino placed a €200 million tap of its bond issue due June 2022, at an effective interest
rate of 1.58%. The operation issue raised the total nominal amount of the bond from €550 million to
€750 million.

  - **Acquisition of Sarenza (Note 3.1.1)**

  - **Commercial partnership between Monoprix and Amazon**

On 26 March 2018, Monoprix and Amazon announced that they were forming a commercial partnership to
deliver grocery items sourced from Monoprix to Amazon's Prime service customers in Paris and its inner
suburbs.
On 12 September 2018, the two partners announced the launch of a dedicated virtual store on the Amazon
Prime Now app and website, giving Amazon Prime members access to over 6,000 products with delivery to the
address of their choice in less than two hours.


-----

  - **Announcement of an asset disposal plan**

On 11 June 2018, the Group announced that it was launching an asset disposal plan to support ongoing
transformation of the business model and accelerate the deleveraging process in France. The plan concerned
non-strategic real estate and other assets identified by the Group with an estimated total realisable value of
€1.5 billion. The objective was for half of the plan to be completed in 2018.
As at 31 December 2018, disposals under the plan totalled €1,105 million and included:

   - sale of 15% of Mercialys shares through an equity swap for €213 million (Note 3.1.4);

   - entry of Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance into the capital of GreenYellow for €150 million (see below);

   - sale of Monoprix real estate assets: following the synallagmatic agreements signed on 28 September and
17 October 2018, the Group completed the sale of buildings pertaining to 53 Monoprix stores to Generali
Group and 14 stores to AG2R La Mondiale on 20 December 2018. After deducting registration fees, these
transactions amounted to €742 million and generated a capital gain of €166 million, net of transaction
costs (Note 6.5). The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing an annual rent
of €35 million.

Indicative offers have also been received for other assets included in the disposal plan, some of which have led
to agreements being signed since the beginning of 2019 (Note 15).

  - **Cooperation in purchasing with Auchan Retail, METRO and the Schiever Group**

On 29 June 2018, the Casino, Auchan Retail, METRO and Schiever groups announced the signature of several
agreements covering their cooperation in purchasing, internationally and in France. Previously, the Casino Group
and Auchan Retail had announced on 3 April 2018 that they had begun exclusive talks to build a global strategic
partnership. This coincided with Casino and Intermarché’s mutually agreed termination of their purchasing
alliance. The Dia group joined the partnership at the end of August 2018.
The new alliances, called Horizon, will focus on moving away from purely transactional negotiations towards a
collaborative, balanced and innovative type of negotiations.
After being granted approval by the relevant competition authorities, Horizon International Services has been up
and running since 15 February 2019 and covers 47 countries in Europe, Asia and South America in which these
companies operate.

  - **Bond buybacks**

A total of €128 million worth of bonds maturing at different dates between 2018 and 2026 were bought back in
July and August 2018. The bonds were purchased as and when market opportunities arose, at prices that the
Group considered attractive. The transactions were in line with the strategy to pay down gross debt. The impact
on the consolidated financial statements was as follows:

   - reduction in debt, including fair value hedges with a negative fair value: €135 million (Note 11.2.2);

   - reduction in hedging instruments with a positive fair value: €3 million;

   - recognition in "Finance costs, net" of a €4 million gain (not taking into account future interest savings).

  - **Rating downgrades**

On 3 September 2018, Standard & Poor’s announced that it was downgrading Casino’s rating from BB+ Stable
outlook to BB Negative outlook. On 28 September 2018, Moody’s announced that it was downgrading Casino’s
rating from Ba1, stable outlook to Ba1, negative outlook.
These changeshave not had any impact on the cost of Casino’s bond debt or on its liquidity position.

  - **Entry of Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance in the capital of GreenYellow**

On 12 October 2018, the Group announced the signing of an agreement under which Tikehau Capital, an asset
management and investment firm, and Bpifrance would acquire a stake in GreenYellow, Casino's subsidiary
dedicated to solar energy and energy efficiency solutions. The operation was completed on 18 December 2018,
through a €150 million share issue underwritten by the two new shareholders, giving them a combined 24% stake.
The impact (net of transaction costs) on the Group’s consolidated financial statements was a €108 million
increase in non-controlling interests and a €35 million increase in equity attributable to equity holders of the
parent.


-----

  - **Partnership with the Quattrucci family**

On 15 October 2018, the Group announced the signing of a partnership with the Quattrucci family whereby
twelve stores specialised in fresh products would join the Casino Group.
These stores, located in the Île-de-France region and the Oise department, generated more than €300 million in
sales in 2017. Since 1 January 2019, the stores have been supplied by the Casino Group; seven have been
converted to the “Marché frais Géant” banner and the other five to the “Marché frais Leader Price” banner.

  - **Creation of a joint venture with ENGIE**

On 17 October 2018, GreenYellow and the ENGIE group announced the creation of a joint venture, Reservoir
Sun, to help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their electricity needs.
The joint venture had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018.

  - **Interim dividend**

On 5 December 2018, the Company paid an interim dividend of €170 million (Note 12.9).

#### Note 3 Scope of consolidation


**Accounting principles**


Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all material subsidiaries, joint ventures
and associates over which the parent company exercises control, joint control or significant influence, either
directly or indirectly (see list of consolidated companies in Note 17).

SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group (i) has power over the entity,
(ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and (iii) has the ability to affect
those returns through its power over the entity.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date when control
is acquired to the date at which the Group no longer exercises control. All controlled companies are fully
consolidated in the Group's statement of financial position, regardless of the percentage interest held.

POTENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS
Control is assessed by taking potential voting rights into account, but only if they are substantive; that is, if the
entity has the practical ability to exercise its rights with respect to the exercise price, date and terms.
The Group may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible into
ordinary shares or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give the Group
voting power or reduce another party's voting power over the financial and operational policies of an entity. The
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when
assessing whether the Group has control of another entity. Potential voting rights are not currently exercisable or
convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the occurrence
of a future event.

JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that exercise joint control over an entity have rights to
its net assets. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control over an entity, which exists only
when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.

ASSOCIATES
Associates are companies in which the Group exercises significant influence over financial and operational
policies without having control. They are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity
method.

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING
The equity method provides that an investment in an associate or a joint venture be recognised initially at
acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted by the Group's share in profit or loss and, where appropriate, in other
comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Goodwill related to these entities is included in the
carrying amount of the investment. Any impairment losses and gains or losses on disposal of investments in
equity-accounted entities are recognised in "Other operating income and expenses".
Profits/losses from internal acquisitions or disposals with equity-accounted associates are eliminated to the
extent of the Group's percentage interest in these companies. In the absence of any guidance in IFRS
concerning cases where the amount to be eliminated is greater than the carrying amount of the investment in the
equity-accounted company, the Group has elected to cap the amount eliminated from the accounts in the
transaction year and to deduct the uneliminated portion from its share of the equity-accounted company's profits
in subsequent years. The Group follows a transparent approach to accounting for associates under the equity
method and takes into account, if relevant, its final percentage interest in the associate for the purpose of
determining the proportion of profit (loss) to be eliminated.
In the absence of any standard or interpretation covering dilution of the Group's interest in a subsidiary of an
equity-accounted company, the dilution impact is recognised in the Group's share of the profit (loss) of the
equity-accounted investee.

Business combinations

As required by IFRS 3 revised, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) in a business combination is
measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred on the date of
the transaction. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair
values.

Acquisition-related costs are recognised in "Other operating expenses", except for those related to the issue of
equity instruments.
Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each business combination, the
Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case, the amount of goodwill is limited to the


-----

portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method. Under the full goodwill method, non-controlling interests
are measured at fair value and goodwill is recognised on the full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.
Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial goodwill method,
which was the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3.

In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is remeasured at fair
value as at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the
previously-held interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under "Other operating income" or "Other operating
expenses").
The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the information
needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new information obtained by the
buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted
after the measurement period (not exceeding 12 months from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent
acquisitions of non-controlling interests do not give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill.

Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair value, whatever
the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration due to
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded by adjusting goodwill if they occur
during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss for the period under "Other operating income" or "Other
operating expenses" if they arise after the measurement period, unless the obligation is settled in equity
instruments. In that case, the contingent consideration is not remeasured subsequently.

Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies

In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of shares in
consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the following principle:

  - the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is eliminated in
full from the accounts of the acquirer;

  - non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a corresponding
adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total equity.

Costs and expenses related to intra-group transfers of shares and to internal restructuring in general are included
in “Other operating expenses”.

Foreign currency translation

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the Group's
parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their financial transactions
are measured in that currency.

The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent company
are translated using the closing rate method, as follows:

- assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated into euros at the closing
rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date;

- income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the period unless
significant variances occur.

The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity. When a foreign
operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on translation of the net investment in the
operation concerned at successive reporting dates are reclassified to profit or loss. Because the Group applies the
step-by-step method of consolidation, the cumulative translation differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if
the foreign operation disposed is part of a sub-group. This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the
sub-group.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rate on the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and the
resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement under "Foreign currency exchange gains"
or "Foreign currency exchange losses". Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the
consolidated financial statements as a separate component of equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal
of the net investment.

Exchange differences arising on translation of (i) foreign currency borrowings hedging a net investment
denominated in a foreign currency or (ii) permanent advances made to subsidiaries are also recognised in equity
and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.

In accordance with IAS 29, the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating
in hyperinflationary economies are (i) restated to take account of changes in the general purchasing power of the
local currency, using official price indices applicable on the reporting date, and (ii) converted into euros at the
exchange rate on the reporting date. The Group has qualified Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy since


-----

2018 (see Note 1.3.3).


###### 3.1 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2018

**3.1.1 Acquisition of Sarenza**

On 30 April 2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, a leading online footwear retailer. The price paid for 100% of the
shares was €22 million (Note 4.5).
Sarenza has been consolidated at net book value, leading to the recognition of provisional goodwill of €24 million
(corresponding to the difference between the book value of the acquired net assets and the consideration
transferred), which has been allocated to the Monoprix CGU.
Sarenza’s contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from 30 April 2018 to 31 December 2018 was
€97 million. If control of Sarenza had been acquired on 1 January 2018, it would have increased consolidated net
sales by €70 million. Its contribution to pre-tax profit for the period was not material.

**3.1.2 Changes in scope relating to the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group**

On 28 February 2018, Franprix-Leader Price sold control of 105 Franprix and Leader Price stores to a master
franchisee. The sale proceeds amounted to €33 million (Note 4.5). The transactions generated a loss of €15
million which is recognised in “Other operating expenses”. If the transactions had been completed on 1 January
2018, the impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales, trading profit and net profit would not have been material.
Franprix-Leader Price has retained a 49% interest in the group of stores and has a call option exercisable
between 2021 and 2023 (Note 3.4.2).

The same master franchisee acquired a 40% stake in another group of Franprix-Leader Price stores. The
investment was accounted for as a transaction between owners. The master franchisee has a put option on its
40% stake and Franprix-Leader Price has a call option. A debt of €17 million was recognised on the date of the
transaction (Note 3.4.1). This transaction had no material impact on consolidated equity.

In addition, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of 126 stores during 2018, at a total cost of €79 million,
including €68 million paid in cash during the period (Note 4.5). Provisional goodwill on these transactions
amounted to €76 million. Some of the stores acquired were previously accounted for by the equity method in the
Casino Group’s consolidated financial statements. The previously-held interest was therefore remeasured at its
acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €22 million gain in “Other operating income”.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2018, the impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales,
trading profit and net profit would not have been material.


-----

**3.1.3 Sale of a group of Casino supermarkets without loss of control**

During first-half 2018, Distribution Casino France sold a 40% stake in five Casino supermarkets to a master
franchisee. This sale without loss of control was accounted for as a transaction between owners. The master
franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake – recognised in an amount of €19 million on the date of the
transaction – and Distribution Casino France has a call option.
This transaction had no material impact on consolidated equity.

**3.1.4 Mercialys TRS**

On 26 July 2018, in connection with the announced asset disposal plan, the Group reduced its stake in Mercialys
from 40.3% of the voting rights to 25.3%, through the block sale to a bank of shares representing 15% of the
capital under a total return swap (TRS). Under the terms of the transaction, the Group received immediate
proceeds amounting to €213 million (Note 4.6).

Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank.
Consequently the shares have not been derecognised at 31 December 2018 and a liability was recorded for
€198 million corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market (Note 11.2.2). The income
statement impact of the bank’s sale during 2018 of 1% of the capital was not material.

At 31 December 2018, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 39.2% equity in Mercialys, of
which 14% corresponds to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank.

The shares under the TRS have been reclassified as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, for €114
million (Note 3.5.1).

###### 3.2 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2017

**3.2.1 Loss of control of a group of Casino supermarkets**

In line with its ongoing franchising development plans, in February 2017, Distribution Casino France sold to a
master franchisee a 51% stake in two sub-groups representing a total of 21 Casino supermarkets that were lossmaking under the integrated management system. The net loss on the sale amounted to €30 million and was
recorded in "Other operating expenses" (Note 6.5).
Distribution Casino France has two call options on these two groups of stores, which are exercisable between
November 2018 and October 2020 (Note 3.4.2).

**3.2.2 Changes in scope relating to the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group**

On 10 February 2017 and 8 March 2017, Franprix-Leader Price acquired an additional 40% stake in the Sarjel
group, which was previously 60%-owned. The amount disbursed for this acquisition was €19 million including
transaction costs (Note 4.8).

In addition, as part of the ongoing strategy to transform the store network and improve its profitability,
Franprix-Leader Price had begun the process of selling a group of 105 Franprix and Leader Price stores to a
master franchisee (Note 3.1.2). At 31 December 2017, the assets and liabilities of these stores – representing net
assets of €33 million – had been reclassified as "Assets held for sale" for €67 million and "Liabilities associated
with assets held for sale" for €34 million.

Lastly, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of various stores during 2017, at a total cost of €43 million (of which
€23 million disbursed during 2017 and the balance in 2018). Provisional goodwill on these transactions amounted
to €29 million. In light of the Group’s equity-accounted investments in some of the entities concerned, the
previously-held interests were remeasured at their acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a
€9 million gain in "Other operating income".
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2017, the impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales,
trading profit and net profit would not have been material.

###### 3.3 Investments in equity-accounted investees

**3.3.1 Significant associates and joint ventures**

The following table presents the condensed financial statements (on a 100% basis) for the four main investees
accounted for by the equity method. These condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS
correspond to the investees' published financial statements, as restated where appropriate for the adjustments
made by the Group, for example fair value adjustments on the date control is acquired or lost, adjustments to
bring the investee's accounting policies into line with Group policies, or adjustments to eliminate gains and losses
on intra-group acquisitions and disposals for the portion corresponding to the Group's percentage interest in the
investee:

(i) As at 31 December 2018, the Group held 25% of the capital of Mercialys (39% interest of which 14% corresponding to shares
classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5). The Group considers that it exercises significant influence over the financial
and operating policies of the Mercialys Group. This position is based on (a) the absence of a majority vote on strategic decisions at
meetings of the company's Board of Directors, which is mostly made up of independent directors, (b) the governance rules stipulating
that Casino's representatives on the Mercialys Board may not take part in decisions concerning transactions carried out with the
Group, (c) business contracts entered into between the Group and Mercialys on an arm's length basis, and (d) an analysis of the
votes cast at recent General Shareholders’ Meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related parties do not control
shareholder decisions at General Meetings).
(ii) Tuya was set up in partnership with Éxito and Bancolombia to manage the banking services offered to customers of the stores in
Colombia, primarily the possibility of signing up for credit cards in the stores. The partnership structure changed in October 2016 when
Éxito became a 50% shareholder of Tuya.
(iii) FIC was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco SA (“Itaú Unibanco”) to finance purchases by GPA's customers. It is
accounted for using the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over its operating and financial policies.
(iv) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of Tuya (interest held by the Éxito sub-group) and FIC
(interest held by GPA). GPA holds 50% of the voting rights in FIC and 41.92% of the capital (including 6.16% through Via Varejo
which is classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5).
(v) The current assets of Banque du Groupe Casino, Tuya and FIC primarily concern their credit business.
(vi) Concerning FIC, the adjustment concerns a statutory reserve over which Itaú Unibanco has exclusive rights.
(vii) Stock dividends worth COP 20 billion (€6 million) paid to the joint venture partners.
(viii) This amount only concerns GPA’s direct interest and does not include €2 million in dividends received by Via Varejo (2017:
€25 million)


-----

**3.3.2 Other investments in associates and joint ventures**

At 31 December 2018, the carrying amounts of investments in other associates and joint ventures stood at
€75 million and €19 million, respectively (Note 3.3.3). The aggregate amounts of key financial statement items for
these associates and joint ventures are not material. Dividends received from these associates and joint ventures
amounted to €5 million in 2018 (2017: €4 million).

(*) Restatement of the investment in Mercialys following the retrospective application of IFRS 15 had a negative impact of €16 million.
(i) The €129 million negative movement in 2018 mainly reflects the reclassification as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5
of the shares underlying a total return swap and not yet sold on the market, for €114 million (Note 3.1.4). It also includes the
previously eliminated share of margin on transactions between Mercialys and the Group, recorded in trading profit for €5 million
following the sale on the market of Mercialys shares representing 1% of the capital that were included in the TRS described in Note
2. The €9 million increase in 2017 corresponded mainly to the elimination of gains and losses on purchases and sales of property
assets between Casino and Mercialys for the portion corresponding to Casino's percentage interest in Mercialys.
(ii) The amount of €54 million in 2018 mainly related to (i) the same type of reclassification concerning the share of these losses from
associates as in 2017 for an amount of €20 million; and (ii) and an amount of €20 million subscribed by Franprix-Leader Price to the
capital increase of a master franchisee. The amount of €40 million in 2017 related to the reclassification of the share of losses from
associates of Franprix-Leader Price that exceeds the book value of the investments, when Franprix-Leader Price has an obligation
to cover its share in the losses of those associates.


-----

**3.3.4 Impairment losses on investments in equity-accounted investees**

With the exception of Mercialys, associates and joint ventures are privately-held companies for which no quoted
market prices are available to estimate their fair value. The impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2018
and 31 December 2017 did not result in the recognition of any impairment loss.

The fair value of the investment in Mercialys at the reporting date was €432 million for 39.2% of net assets,
determined using the share price on 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: €683 million for 40.2%). This did not
result in the recognition of any impairment loss. Mercialys' EPRA NNNAV at 31 December 2018 amounted to
€1,940 million on a 100% basis, of which the Group’s share was €761 million.

**3.3.5 Share of contingent liabilities of equity-accounted investees**

As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, none of the Group's associates and joint ventures had any
material contingent liabilities.

**3.3.6 Related-party transactions (equity-accounted investees)**

The related party transactions shown below mainly concern transactions carried out in the normal course of
business with companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (associates) or joint control (joint
ventures) that are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. These
transactions are carried out on arm's length terms.

leases for €55 million). At 31 December 2018, future minimum lease payments due to Mercialys on property assets
amounted to €111 million, including €40 million due within one year.
(ii) Including €1,164 million in fuel purchases from Distridyn and €1,127 million in goods purchases from CD Supply Innovation
in 2018 (2017: €1,095 million and €0 million respectively).
(iii) Income of €1,051 million in 2018 (2017: €937 million) includes sales of goods by Franprix-Leader Price and Distribution
Casino France to master franchisees accounted for by the equity method, for €899 million (2017: €826 million). It also
includes income related to property development transactions with Mercialys reported under "Other revenue" for €33 million
(2017: €38 million).

**Transactions with Mercialys**

Casino has entered into various agreements with Mercialys:
- Leases: Casino leases units in certain shopping centres from Mercialys, for which the rent is included in the
above table.
- Asset management agreement: Casino provides rental management services for nearly all Mercialys
properties. In 2018, the related management fees amounted to €6 million (2017: €6 million).
- Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by Casino’s Board of Directors on 19 June 2012 and
an addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership's fundamental principle, whereby Casino
develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth, has been
maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects offering
satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to propose new projects that will be examined by
Casino and tracked during monitoring committee meetings.
Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary permits
have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of total projected rental
revenues from signed leases.


-----

The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on the
basis of (i) a rent capitalisation rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by reference to the
rates used to value Mercialys' portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the project. Under the new
agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to 10% – may also be taken
into account for pricing purposes.
The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has been
maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed. For example, the
price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside) difference between
the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at the outset. The contracts
require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process.
In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that could
lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group's food stores.
At the end of January 2017, the partnership agreement was extended by three years, until end-2020.
No projects were sold under the partnership agreement in 2018.
- Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, finance/accounting, IT and real estate
support services to Mercialys. In 2018, the related fees amounted to €2 million (2017: €2 million).
- Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real estate
portfolio enhancement specialists. This agreement had no material impact in 2018 or 2017.
The parties decided to terminate the agreement on 31 December 2018. A new fixed-term agreement has
been signed with an initial term of six months (1 January to 30 June 2019), covering asset management
services provided by Mercialys’ teams on projects managed on Casino’s behalf. The agreement is
automatically renewable for successive six-month terms up to a maximum of 48 months in total.
- Exclusive sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys.
- Current account and cash management agreement: Casino has provided Mercialys with a €50 million
confirmed line of credit expiring in December 2020 at an annual interest rate based on the Euribor plus a
spread ranging from 40 bps to 95 bps depending on the amount borrowed under the facility. The Group also
charges an annual 38-bps commitment fee (40% of the maximum 95-bps spread) on undrawn amounts. This
agreement had no material impact in 2018 or 2017.

In 2018, the Group signed a property development contract with Sacré Cœur, a subsidiary of Mercialys. After
eliminating a percentage corresponding to the Group's interest in Mercialys, the contract led to the recognition of
€24 million in "Other revenue" and a non-material contribution to EBITDA.

In addition, the Group sold three property development projects of hypermarkets scheduled for transformation to
third parties. After eliminating a percentage corresponding to the Group's 10% interest in the associates
concerned, the transactions led to the recognition of €47 million in "Other revenue" and a €24 million contribution
to EBITDA in 2018.

**3.3.7 Commitments to joint ventures**

The Group has given guarantees to joint ventures (also presented in Note 6.11.1) for an amount of €93 million at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: €125 million), including €68 million on behalf of Distridyn and €25 million
on behalf of CD Supply Innovation.


-----

###### 3.4 Commitments related to the scope of consolidation

**3.4.1 Put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests** **– “NCI puts”**


**Accounting principle**

The Group has granted put options to the owners of non-controlling interests in some of its subsidiaries. The
exercise price may be fixed or based on a predetermined formula. The options may be exercisable at any
time or on a specified date. In accordance with IAS 32, obligations under these NCI puts are recognised as
"Financial liabilities"; fixed price options are recognised at their discounted present value and variable price
options at fair value. NCI puts are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial
position, "Put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests".

IAS 27 revised, which was effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, and
subsequently IFRS 10, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, describe the
accounting treatment of acquisitions of additional shares in subsidiaries. The Group has decided to apply
two different accounting methods for these NCI puts, depending on whether they were granted before or after
1 January 2010, as recommended by France's securities regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers):

    - NCI puts granted before the effective date of IAS 27 revised are accounted for using the goodwill
method whereby the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the
non-controlling interests is recognised in goodwill. In subsequent years, this liability is remeasured
and any changes adjust goodwill.

    - NCI puts granted since IAS 27 revised came into effect are accounted for as transactions between
shareholders, with the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the
non-controlling interests recognised as a deduction from equity. In subsequent years, this liability is
remeasured and any changes adjust equity.


“NCI puts” can be analysed as follows at 31 December 2018:

Distribution Casino France[(iii)] 60.00% 40.00% V 20 
Other 4 1

**Total NCI put liabilities** **63** **126**

(i) The value of NCI puts on subsidiaries of the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group is generally based on net profit or a multiple of
net sales. A 10% increase or decrease in these indicators would not have a material impact. The options expire between 2018
and 2031.
(ii) This option is exercisable at any time until 21 June 2021. The exercise price is the highest amount obtained using different
calculation formulas. The formula applied at 31 December 2018 is based on a multiple of 12 times average net profit for the
last two years. A 10% increase or decrease in net profit would lead to a €12 million increase or decrease in the financial
liability as at 31 December 2018.
(iii) The value of the puts is based on a multiple of net sales generated by the five underlying Casino supermarkets (Note 3.1.3). A
10% increase or decrease in the indicator would not have a material impact. The option is exercisable between 1 April and
30 June 2023.
(iv) As at 31 December 2017, NCI put liabilities amounted to €171 million, including current liabilities of €143 million. The increase
in 2018 mainly reflected new puts granted to master franchisees on Franprix-Leader Price and Casino stores in the
transactions described in Notes 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.


-----

**3.4.2 Off-balance sheet commitments**


**Accounting principle**


Puts and calls relating to non-controlling interests are generally accounted for as derivative instruments. The
exercise price of these options generally reflects the fair value of the underlying assets.
Under the terms of the option contracts, the exercise price of written put and call options may be determined
using earnings multiples of the companies concerned. In this case, the options are valued based on the
latest published earnings for options exercisable at any time and earnings forecasts or projections for options
exercisable as of a given future date. In many cases, the put option written by the Group is matched by a call
written by the other party; in these cases, the value shown corresponds to that of the written put.

Written put options on shares in non-controlled companies stood at €15 million as at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: €16 million), and concerned entities within the Monoprix and Franprix-Leader Price sub-groups.

Call options granted to the Group on shares in non-controlled companies stood at €348 million as at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: €421 million), and mainly concerned:

- The following call options in connection with transactions carried out with Mercialys:

  - call option on 100% of the assets or 100% of the shares of Hyperthetis Participations, exercisable from
31 December 2020 and until 31 March 2022 at the higher of the fair value of the underlying and a guaranteed
minimum IRR;

  - call option on a property asset previously sold to Immosiris, exercisable between 31 March 2021 and

- Lastly, in connection with the transactions carried out with master franchisees described in Notes 3.1.2, 3.2.1 and
3.2.2, the Group has call options on stores that are exercisable between 2018 and 2023 at prices based on a
percentage of the improvement in EBITDA or a multiple of net sales.

###### 3.5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations


**Accounting principle**

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and their fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for
sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale
in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management must be committed to a plan to sell
the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion of a sale within one year of the date of
this classification. Considering these characteristics, net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the
parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction from net debt (Note 11).

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated or
amortised.

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held
for sale, and:

    - represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is part of
a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations; or

    - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

An operation represents a separate major line of business when it constitutes a reportable segment. It is
classed as discontinued if the criteria for classifying the related assets as "held for sale" have been met or
when it has already been disposed of. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when the operation is
disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for sale.

When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of cash
flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as from the first
day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated
income statement, “Profit from discontinued operations”, which includes the net profit or loss of the
discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment loss recognised to write
down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or any after-tax disposal gains or
losses.

#### Note 4 Additional cash flow disclosures


**Accounting principle**

The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method starting from consolidated net profit (loss)
and is organised in three sections:

    - Cash flows from operating activities, including taxes, transaction costs for acquisitions of
subsidiaries, dividends received from associates and joint ventures and payments received in respect
of government grants.

    - Cash flows from investing activities, including acquisitions of subsidiaries (excluding transaction
costs), proceeds from disposals of subsidiaries (including transaction costs), acquisitions and
disposals of investments in non-consolidated companies, associates and joint ventures (including
transaction costs), contingent consideration paid for business combinations during the measurement
period and up to the amount of the identified liability, and acquisitions and disposals of intangible
assets and property plant and equipment (including transaction costs and deferred payments),
excluding finance leases.

    - Cash flows from financing activities, including new borrowings and repayments of borrowings, issues
of equity instruments, transactions between shareholders (including transaction costs and any
deferred payments), net interest paid (cash flows related to finance costs and non-recourse factoring
and associated transaction costs), treasury share transactions and dividend payments. This category
also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt.

#### Note 5 Segment information


**Accounting principle**

In accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis as the
Group's internal reporting system used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Since 2016, the Group's reportable segments are as follows:

    - France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments (mainly the Casino,
Monoprix, Franprix-Leader Price and Vindémia sub-group banners);

    - Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin America
(mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco-Devoto and Libertad sub-group banners);

    - E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding company.

The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms of
product type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution methods,
marketing offer and long-term financial performance.

These reportable segments reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual strategy and
the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real estate asset
management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities.

Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales, trading profit (which
includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group's business units) and EBITDA. EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring
depreciation and amortisation expense.

Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are
therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information.

Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

of the agreement for the enforcement of the October 2016 ruling by Brazil's supreme federal court stipulating that the ICMS-ST
tax is not a final tax and should not therefore be included in the basis of assessment of PIS and COFINS taxes, allowing GPA to
apply for a refund from the Brazilian state administrations. Recognition of the pre-November 2016 ICMS-ST tax credits of
Sendas Distribution (a subsidiary of GPA), in the amount of BRL 369 million (€102 million), had no impact on the consolidated

#### Note 6 Activity data

###### 6.1 Total revenue


Following the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, the Group revised its revenue accounting policy.

**Accounting principle**

**Total revenue:**

Total revenue is analysed between “Net sales” and “Other revenue”.

“Net sales" include sales by the Group’s stores, service stations, e-commerce sites and restaurants, franchise
fees, revenues from business leases and financial services revenues.
Most of the amount reported under Group “Net sales” corresponds to revenue included in the scope of IFRS 15.

“Other revenue" consists of revenue from the property development and property trading businesses, rental
revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and
revenues from the energy business.
The majority of amounts reported under “Other revenue” are included in the scope of IFRS 15, while rental
revenues are included in the scope of IAS 17.

Revenue is measured at the contract price, corresponding to the consideration to which the Group expects to be
entitled in exchange for the supply of goods or services. The transaction price is allocated to the performance
obligations in the contract, which represent the units of account for revenue recognition purposes. Revenue is
recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of the good or service passes to the
customer. Revenue may therefore be recognised at a specific point in time or over time based on the stage of
completion.

The Group’s main sources of revenue are as follows:

  - Sales of goods (including through the property trading business): in this case, the Group generally has only

one performance obligation, that of delivering the good to the customer. Revenue from these sales is
recognised when control of the good is transferred to the customer upon delivery, i.e., generally:

     - at the checkout for in-store sales;

     - on receipt of the goods by the franchisee or affiliated store;

     - on receipt of the goods by the customer for e-commerce sales.

  - Sales of services, for example sales of subscriptions, franchising fees, logistics services, rental revenue and

property management services: in this case, for operations included in the scope of IFRS 15, the Group
generally has only one performance obligation, to supply the service, and the related revenues are
recognised over the period in which the services are performed.

  - Property development revenues: in this case, the Group generally has several performance obligations,

some of which may be satisfied at a given point in time and others over time based on the project’s
percentage of completion. Profit from property development activities is generally calculated on a
percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the projected margin on completion weighted by the
percentage of completion determined by the inputs method.

  - Revenues from the energy business, for which the Group generally identifies a performance obligation when

the solar power plant is delivered (in exchange for variable consideration in some cases) or when the energy
performance contracts are sold. The Group also sells energy services for which the related revenue is
recognised when the service is performed.

The vast majority of revenues are recognised at a given point in time.

If settlement of the consideration is deferred for an unusually long time and no promise of financing is explicitly
stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms, revenue is recognised by adjusting the consideration for
the effects of the time value of money. If significant, the difference between this price and the unadjusted
transaction price is recognised in “Other financial income” over the payment deferral period, determined using the
effective interest method.

The Group operates loyalty programmes that enable customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future
purchases. Award credits granted to customers under loyalty programmes represent a performance obligation that
is separately identifiable from the initial sales transaction. This performance obligation gives rise to the recognition
of a contract liability. The corresponding revenue is deferred until the award credits are used by the customer.

**Contract assets and liabilities, incremental costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a**


-----

**contract**



   - A contract asset corresponds to an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the

entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time.
Based on this definition, a receivable does not constitute a contract asset.

The Group recognises a contract asset when it has fulfilled all or part of its performance obligation but does not
have an unconditional right to payment (i.e., the Group does not yet have the right to invoice the customer). In light
of its business, contract assets recognised by the Group are not material.

   - A contract liability corresponds to an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which

the entity has received consideration from the customer.

The Group recognises contract liabilities mainly for award credits granted under its loyalty programmes, advances
received and sales for which all or part of the performance obligation has not yet been fulfilled (e.g., sales of
subscriptions and gift cards, and future performance obligations of the property development business for which
the customer has already been invoiced followed by payment of consideration).

   - The incremental costs to obtain a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a

customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained and which it expects to recover.

The costs to fulfil a contract are costs related directly to a contract that generate or enhance the resources that will
be used by the Group in satisfying its performance obligations and which it expects to recover.
For the Group, the costs of obtaining and fulfilling contracts correspond primarily to the costs incurred in
connection with its franchising and affiliation business. These costs are capitalised and amortised over the life of
the franchise or affiliation contract. The capitalised amounts are tested regularly for impairment.

Contract assets and the costs of obtaining and fulfilling contracts are tested for impairment under IFRS 9.

###### 6.2 Cost of goods sold


Following the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, the Group revised its accounting policy
concerning the cost of goods sold.

**Accounting principle**

Gross margin
Gross margin corresponds to the difference between "Net sales" and the "Cost of goods sold".

“Cost of goods sold" comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees and any
tax credits associated with the purchases, changes in retail inventories, amortisation of the incremental costs
of obtaining contacts and costs to fulfil contracts, and logistics costs. It also includes property development
and property trading business costs and changes in the related inventories.

Commercial cooperation fees are measured based on contracts signed with suppliers. They are billed in
instalments over the year. At each year-end, an accrual is recorded for the amount receivable or payable,
corresponding to the difference between the value of the services actually rendered to the supplier and the
sum of the instalments billed during the year.

Change in inventories
Changes in inventories, which may be positive or negative, are determined after taking into account any
impairment losses.

Logistics costs
Logistics costs correspond to the cost of logistics operations managed or outsourced by the Group,
comprising all warehousing, handling and freight costs incurred after goods are first received at one of the
Group's sites. Transport costs included in suppliers' invoices (e.g., for goods purchased on a "delivery duty
paid" or "DDP" basis) are included in “Purchases and change in inventories”. Outsourced transport costs are
recognised under "Logistics costs".


**(€ millions)** **Note** **2018** **2017 (restated)**

Purchases and change in inventories **(26,323)** (27,022)

Logistics costs 6.3 **(1,508)** (1,532)

-----

###### 6.3 Expenses by nature and function


Following the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, the Group revised its accounting policy
concerning “Selling expenses”.

**Accounting principle**

Selling expenses
“Selling expenses” consist of point-of-sale costs.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including the
purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions.

Pre-opening and post-closure costs
Pre-opening costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation and post-closure costs are recognised in
operating expense when incurred.

**Total** **(1,532)** **(6,902)** **(1,376)** **(9,810)**

(i) Logistics costs are reported under “Cost of goods sold”.

A competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE) was introduced in France, corresponding to a tax credit
(refundable if not used within three years) based on a percentage of salaries that do not exceed 2.5x the French
minimum wage (SMIC). The rate was 7% in 2017 and 6% for salaries paid as from 1 January 2018 (9% for
Vindémia). In 2018, the CICE tax benefit of €78 million (2017: €104 million) was recognised as a deduction from
employee benefits expense and the receivable was sold on a no-recourse basis, as in 2017. The CICE has been
abolished with effect from 1 January 2019 and replaced by a reduction in social security contributions.

###### 6.4 Depreciation and amortisation


-----

###### 6.5 Other operating income and expenses


**Accounting principle**

This caption covers two types of items:

- Income and expenses which, by definition, are not included in an assessment of a business unit's recurring
operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses on
non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope of consolidation (for example,
transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from disposals of subsidiaries,
remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests).

- Income and expenses arising from major events occurring during the period that would distort analyses of the
Group's recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are limited in
number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs (such as
reorganisation costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions and expenses for
litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments).


(i) The net gain on disposal of non-current assets in 2018 primarily concerned the France Retail segment and especially disposals of
Monoprix store properties (Note 2).
(ii) The impairment loss recognised in 2018 mainly concerns the France Retail segment. Impairment losses recorded in 2017 mainly
concerned individual assets in the France Retail segment for €36 million, the Latam Retail segment (primarily GPA) for €28 million,
and the E-commerce segment for €7 million.
(iii) The net expense of €146 million recorded in 2018 resulted primarily from the reclassification to profit or loss, in accordance with IAS
21, of foreign currency translation adjustments accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve for an amount of €67 million
(Note 12.7.2). The €90 million net expense recognised in 2017 resulted mainly from the loss of control of supermarket stores at
Distribution Casino France for an amount of €30 million (Note 3.2.1), a net expense related to various changes in scope at FranprixLeader Price for €9 million, and fees of €31 million.
(iv) Restructuring provisions and expenses in 2018 primarily concerns the France Retail segment for €140 million (including employee
costs and store closure costs for €102 million and store transformation costs for €24 million) and the Latam Retail segment (mainly
GPA) for €58 million. Restructuring provisions and expenses in 2017 mainly concerned the France Retail segment for €169 million
(including employee costs and store closure costs for €113 million and store transformation costs for €54 million) and the Latam Retail
segment (mainly GPA) for €38 million.
(v) Provisions and expenses for litigation and risks represent a net expense of €84 million in 2018, including €35 million for tax risks at
GPA. The net expense of €92 million in 2017 included €60 million for the tax amnesty programmes in which GPA participated during
the period.
(vi) Reconciliation of the breakdown of asset impairment losses with the tables of asset movements:

_of which presented under "Gains and losses on disposal of non-current assets"_ **_4_** _1_


-----

###### 6.6 Inventories


**Accounting principle**


Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and probable net realisable value. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the
probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis takes into account the business unit's operating
environment and the type, age, turnover characteristics and sales pattern of the products concerned.

The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by the
GPA sub-group which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA’s
inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method was
applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in
bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in the carrying
amount together with supplier discounts deducted from "Cost of goods sold". The cost of inventories also
includes gains or losses on cash flow hedges of future inventory purchases initially accumulated in equity.

For its property development and property trading businesses, the Casino Group recognises assets and projects
in progress in inventories.

###### 6.7 Trade receivables


Following the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018, the Group reviewed its accounting policies
concerning trade receivables.

**Accounting principle**

The Group’s trade receivables are current financial assets (Note 11) that correspond to an unconditional right to
receive consideration. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
less any impairment losses. The fair value of trade receivables usually corresponds to the amount on the
invoice. A loss allowance for expected credit losses is recorded upon recognition of the receivable. The Group
applies the simplified approach for the measurement of expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables,
which are determined based on credit losses observed for receivables with the same profile, as adjusted to take
into account forward-looking factors such as the customer’s credit status or the economic environment.
Trade receivables can be sold to banks and continue to be carried as assets in the statement of financial
position for as long as the contractual cash flows and substantially all the related risks and rewards are not
transferred to a third party.

(i) The decrease mainly concerns the extinction of a GPA receivable in respect of leases on store properties (“Paes Mendonça
receivable”). This receivable was extinguished in September 2018 by offsetting it against the bonus paid when the leases on
these stores were renewed for a 30 year-period, which led to the recognition of an intangible asset in the amount of
BRL 652 million (€151 million – Note 10.2.2). Following the renewal, BRL 101 million (€23 million) of this amount represented
interest and was recognised in “Other financial income” for 2018 (Note 11.3.2).
(ii) The increase in 2018 corresponds primarily to the reversal of the allowance recorded against Assaí’s ICMS-ST tax credit
(Note 5.1).

GPA has a total of €755 million in tax receivables (of which €618 million in long-term receivables and €137 million in
short-term receivables), corresponding primarily to ICMS (VAT) for €519 million, PIS/COFINS (VAT) and INSS
(employer social security contributions). GPA expects the main tax receivable (ICMS) to be recovered as follows:

**(€ millions)** **31 December 2018**

Within one year **78**

In one to five years **313**

In more than five years **128**

**Total** **519**

GPA recognises ICMS and other tax credits when it has formally established and documented its right to use the
credits and expects to use them within a reasonable period. These credits are recognised as a deduction from the
cost of goods sold.

commitments likely to have a material effect on the Group's current or future financial position other than those
described in this note.

The completeness of this information is checked by the Finance, Legal and Tax departments, which also
participate in drawing up contracts that are binding on the Group.

Commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business mainly concern the Group's operating activities
except for undrawn confirmed lines of credit, which represent a financing commitment.

Off-balance sheet commitments related to the scope of consolidation are presented in Note 3.4.2 and lease
commitments in Note 7.

#### Note 7 Leases


**Accounting principle**


At the inception of an agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease
agreement.
The Group's lease agreements are recognised in accordance with IAS 17 which distinguishes between finance
leases and operating leases.

Finance lease agreements
Lease agreements for property, plant and equipment that transfer nearly all the risks and benefits inherent to
ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. After initial recognition, the assets are depreciated over their expected useful life in
the same way as other assets in the same category, or over the lease term if shorter, unless the Group has a
reasonable certainty that it will obtain ownership at the end of the lease.
Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between the interest expense and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period covered by the lease agreement so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Operating leases
The other lease agreements are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group's statement
of financial position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Incentives received from the lessor are an integral part of the total net
rental expense and are recorded as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments (Note 7.2) correspond to fixed future minimum payments calculated over the
non-cancellable term of operating leases.

###### 7.1 Operating lease expenses

Rental expenses related to operating leases amounted to €987 million in 2018, including €840 million for real estate
leases, of which €556 million in the France Retail segment and €193 million in Brazil (2017: €982 million, including
€852 million for real estate leases, of which €546 million in the France Retail segment and €222 million in Brazil). This
information only concerns continuing operations.

The amount of future operating lease payments and minimum lease payments to be received under non-cancellable
sub-leases are presented in Note 7.2.

###### 7.2 Operating lease commitments (off-balance sheet)

 REAL ESTATE LEASES WHERE THE GROUP IS LESSEE

The Group has operating leases on properties used in the business that it does not own. Future minimum lease
payments, corresponding to the payments due over the non-cancellable term of operating leases plus any lease
termination penalties, break down as follows:

**Future minimum lease payments**

Employee benefits expense is analysed by function in Note 6.3.

###### 8.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits


**Accounting principle**

Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits

Group companies provide their employees with various employee benefit plans depending on local laws and
practice.

- **Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and has no obligation to**
pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to
employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred.

- **Under defined benefit plans, the Group's obligation is measured using the projected unit credit method**
based on the agreements effective in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise
to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the final
obligation. The final obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to measure the obligation
vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the relevant country. The obligation is measured by
independent actuaries annually for the most significant plans and for the employment termination benefit,
and regularly for all other plans. Assumptions include expected rate of future salary increases, estimated
average years of service, life expectancy and staff turnover rates (based on resignations only).

Actuarial gains and losses arise from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience
adjustments (differences between results based on previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually
occurred). All actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in
other comprehensive income.

Past service cost, corresponding to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from the introduction of a
new benefit plan or modification of an existing plan, is expensed immediately.

The expense in the income statement comprises:

       - service cost, i.e., the cost of services provided during the year, recognised in trading profit;

       - past service cost and the effect of plan curtailments or settlements, generally recognised in
"Other operating income and expenses";

       - interest cost, corresponding to the discounting adjustment to the projected benefit obligation net of
the return on plan assets, recorded in "Other financial income and expenses". Interest cost is
calculated by applying the discount rate defined in IAS 19 to the net obligation (i.e., the projected
obligation less related plan assets) recognised in respect of defined benefit plans, as determined at
the beginning of the year.

The provision recognised in the statement of financial position is measured as the net present value of the
obligation less the fair value of plan assets.

Provisions for other in service long-term employee benefits

- **Other in-service long-term employee benefits, such as jubilees, are also covered by provisions,**
determined on the basis of an actuarial estimate of vested rights as of the reporting date. Actuarial gains
and losses on these benefit plans are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**8.2.2 Presentation of pension** **plans**

###### DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

Defined contribution plans are plans in which the company pays regular contributions into a fund. The company's
obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute to the fund and it offers no guarantee that the fund will have
sufficient assets to pay all of the employees' entitlements to benefits. This type of plan predominantly concerns
employees of the Group’s French subsidiaries, who are covered by the general social security system, which is
administered by the French government.

In 2018, defined contribution plans represented a cost of €326 million of which 89% concerned the Group's French
subsidiaries (2017: €334 million excluding discontinued operations and 87%).

###### DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

In certain countries, local laws or conventional agreements provide for the payment of a lump sum to employees
either when they retire or at certain times post-retirement, based on their years of service and final salary at the age
of retirement.

**8.2.3 Main assumptions used in determining total defined benefit obligations** **(pension**
**plans)**

Defined benefit plans are exposed to risks concerning future interest rates, salary increase rates and mortality rates.

The following table presents the main actuarial assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation:

**France** **International**

**2018** **2017** **2018** **2017**

Discount rate **1.7%** 1.5% **1.7% - 7.1%** 1.5% - 7.7%

Expected rate of future salary increases **1.6% - 2.0%** 1.5% - 2.0% **1.0% - 3.5%** 1.0% - 3.5%

Retirement age **62 - 65 years** 62 - 65 years **57 - 65 years** 57 - 65 years

For French companies, the discount rate is determined by reference to the Bloomberg 15-year AA corporate
composite index.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

A 50-basis point increase (decrease) in the discount rate would have the effect of reducing the projected benefit
obligation by 5.9% (increasing the projected benefit obligation by 6.1%).

A 50-basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of salary increases would have the effect of increasing the
projected benefit obligation by 6.0% (reducing the projected benefit obligation by 5.8%).

|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10|6|11|15|24|


**Accounting principle**

Share-based payments

Management and selected employees of the Group receive stock options (options to purchase or subscribe for
shares) and free shares.

The benefit represented by stock options, measured at fair value on the grant date, constitutes additional
compensation. The grant-date fair value of the options is recognised in "Employee benefits expense" over the
option vesting period or in "Other operating expenses" when the benefit relates to a transaction that is also
recognised in "Other operating income and expenses" (Note 6.5). The fair value of options is determined using
the Black & Scholes option pricing model, based on the plan attributes, market data (including the market price
of the underlying shares, share price volatility and the risk-free interest rate) at the grant date and assumptions
concerning the probability of grantees remaining with the Group until the options vest.

The fair value of free shares is also determined on the basis of the plan attributes, market data at the grant date
and assumptions concerning the probability of grantees remaining with the Group until the shares vest. If the
free shares are not subject to any vesting conditions, the cost of the plan is recognised in full on the grant date.
Otherwise it is deferred and recognised over the vesting period as and when the vesting conditions are met.
When free shares are granted to employees in connection with a transaction affecting the scope of
consolidation, the related cost is recorded in "Other operating income and expenses".


-----

Free shares are granted to certain company managers and store managers. In certain cases, the shares vest in
tranches, subject to the attainment of a performance target for the period concerned. In all cases, the shares are
forfeited if the grantee leaves the Group before the end of the vesting period.

**8.3.1 Impact of share-based payments on earnings and equity**

The total net cost of share-based payment plans recognised in the operating income in 2018 was €21 million (2017:
€18 million), including €12 million for Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and €9 million for GPA. The net cost is balanced
by a positive impact on equity for €18 million.

**8.3.2 Casino, Guichard-Perrachon stock option plans**

#### Note 9 Income tax


**Accounting principle**

Income tax expense corresponds to the sum of the current taxes due by the various Group companies, adjusted
for deferred taxes.
Substantially all qualifying French subsidiaries are members of the tax group headed by Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon and file a consolidated tax return.
Current tax expense reported in the income statement corresponds to the tax expense of the parent company of
the tax group and of companies that are not members of a tax group.
Deferred tax assets correspond to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences, tax loss
carryforwards, unused tax credits and certain consolidation adjustments that are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for:

- taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability results from recognition of a
non-deductible impairment loss on goodwill or from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor
taxable profit or the tax loss; and

- taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except
when the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that it will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.

Deferred taxes are recognised using the balance sheet approach and in accordance with IAS 12. They are
calculated by the liability method, which consists of adjusting deferred taxes recognised in prior periods for the
effect of any enacted changes in the income tax rate.
The Group reviews the probability of deferred tax assets being recovered on a periodic basis for each tax entity.
This review may, if necessary, lead to the derecognition of deferred tax assets recognised in prior years. The
probability for recovery is assessed based on a tax plan indicating the level of projected taxable profits.
The assumptions underlying the tax plan are consistent with those used in the medium-term business plans and
budgets prepared by Group entities and approved by management.

The French corporate value-added tax (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises – CVAE) which is
based on the value-added reflected in the separate financial statements, is included in "Income tax expense" in
the consolidated income statement.

When payments to holders of equity instruments are deductible for tax purposes, the tax effect is recognised by
the Group in the income statement.

_Reconciliation of theoretical income tax expense to actual income tax expense_


(i) The reconciliation of the effective tax rate paid by the Group is based on the current French rate of 34.43%, unchanged from
2017.
(ii) In 2018, this concerned the E-commerce segment for €39 million and the France Retail segment for €43 million. In 2017,
following the review of earnings outlooks and tax options implemented at Segisor (French holding company for the voting
shares of its Brazilian subsidiary), tax loss carryforwards in an amount of €153 million were recognised, giving rise to deferred
tax assets of €44 million.
(iii) In 2018, this concerned the E-commerce segment for €28 million and the France Retail segment for €9 million. In 2017, this
concerned the E-commerce segment for €32 million and the Latam Retail segment for €19 million.
(iv) In 2018, the main impact relates to disposals of Monoprix store properties. In 2017, deferred taxes were measured at the tax
rate expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, taking into account the adoption on 21 December 2017 of the
2018 Finance Act providing for a gradual reduction in the corporate tax rate to 25.825% in 2022 and beyond. This change had
a positive impact on deferred taxes of €13 million.
(v) Tax laws in some countries cap the deductibility of interest paid by companies. In France, since the 2012 amended
Finance Act, companies are required to add back 25% of interest expense to their taxable profit. The resulting income tax
amounts disclosed for the periods presented mainly concern French entities.
(vi) See Note 6.3.
(vii) Corresponding to the non-deductible negative foreign currency translation reserve reclassified to profit or loss (Note 6.5).
(viii) In 2017, the Group recorded a tax benefit of €60 million corresponding to a refund of the tax on distributed earnings received

#### Note 10 Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property


**Accounting principle**


The cost of non-current assets corresponds to their purchase cost plus transaction expenses including tax. For
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property, these expenses are added to the
assets' carrying amount and follow the same accounting treatment.

###### 10.1 Goodwill


**Accounting principle**

At the acquisition date, goodwill is measured in accordance with the accounting principle applicable to
"Business combinations", described in Note 3. It is allocated to the cash generating unit (CGU) or groups of cash
generating units that benefit from the synergies of the combination, based on the level at which the return on
investment is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is not amortised. It is tested for impairment
at each year-end, or whenever events or a change of circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Impairment
losses on goodwill are not reversible. The methods used by the Group to test goodwill for impairment are
described in the "Impairment of non-current assets" section in Note 10.5. Negative goodwill is recognised
directly in the income statement for the period of the business combination, once the identification and
measurement of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been verified.

recognised on the acquisition of Sarenza (Note 3.1.1). The €41 million increase in goodwill as at 31 December 2017
corresponded primarily to goodwill of €32 million recognised on the acquisition of various controlling interests by FranprixLeader Price (Note 3.2.2).
(ii) In 2018, this line reflects (i) reclassification of assets from the France Retail segment in assets held for sale; and (ii) the
remeasurement of goodwill in Argentina for €61 million, in application of IAS 29.

###### 10.2 Other intangible assets


**Accounting principle**


Intangible assets acquired separately by the Group are initially recognised at cost and those acquired in
business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Intangible assets consist mainly of purchased
software, software developed for internal use, trademarks, patents and lease premiums. Trademarks that are
created and developed internally are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Intangible assets are
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as determined separately for each asset
category. Capitalised development costs are amortised over three years and software over three to ten years.
Indefinite life intangible assets (including lease premiums and purchased trademarks) are not amortised, but are
tested for impairment at each year-end or whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be
recovered.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use
or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between the
net sale proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss ("Other operating
income and expenses") when the asset is derecognised.

Residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed at each year-end and revised prospectively
if necessary.

-----

###### 10.3 Property, plant and equipment


**Accounting principle**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditures are recognised in assets if they satisfy the recognition criteria of IAS 16. The Group
examines these criteria before incurring the expenditure.

Land is not depreciated. All other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives for each category of assets, with generally no residual value. The main useful
lives are as follows:

**Asset category** **Depreciation period (years)**

Land   
Buildings (structure) 50

Roof waterproofing 15

Fire protection of the building structure 25

Land improvements 10 to 40

Building fixtures and fittings 5 to 20

Technical installations, machinery and equipment 5 to 20

Computer equipment 3 to 5

"Roof waterproofing" and "Fire protection of the building structure" are classified as separate items of property,
plant and equipment only when they are installed during major renovation projects. In all other cases, they are
included in the "Building (structure)" category.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected
from their use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference
between the net sale proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss
("Other operating income and expenses") when the asset is derecognised.

Residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year-end and revised prospectively
if necessary.

Property, plant and equipment were tested for impairment as at 31 December 2018 using the method described in
Note 10.5 "Impairment of non-current assets." The test results are presented in the same note.

**10.3.3 Capitalised borrowing costs**


**Accounting principle**


Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (typically more than six months) are
capitalised in the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in
which they are incurred. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by an entity in connection with the
borrowing of funds.

Interest capitalised in 2018 amounted to €11 million, reflecting an average interest rate of 6.1% (2017: €14 million at
an average rate of 7.7%).


-----

###### 10.4 Investment property


**Accounting principle**

Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental revenue or for capital appreciation or both. The
shopping malls owned by the Group are classified as investment property.

Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Investment property is depreciated over the same useful life and according to
the same rules as owner-occupied property.

FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY

The main investment properties as at 31 December 2018 were held by Éxito.
As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of investment property was €847 million (31 December 2017: €798 million).
For most investment properties, fair value is determined on the basis of valuations carried out by independent
valuers. In accordance with international valuation standards, they are based on market value as confirmed by
market indicators, representing a level 3 fair value input.
In addition, the fair value of investment property classified as “Assets held for sale” was €24 million as at
31 December 2018 and primarily concerned the France Retail segment (31 December 2017: €56 million).


-----

###### 10.5 Impairment of non-current assets (intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and goodwill)


**Accounting principle**

The procedure to be followed to ensure that the carrying amount of assets does not exceed their recoverable
amount (recovered by use or sale) is defined in IAS 36.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually, at the end of the year, for goodwill and
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.

Cash Generating Units (CGUs)
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and that generates
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The Group has defined its cash generating units as follows:

- for hypermarkets, supermarkets and discount stores, each store is treated as a separate CGU;

- for other networks, each network represents a separate CGU.

Impairment indicators
Apart from the external sources of data monitored by the Group (economic environment, market value of the
assets, etc.), the impairment indicators used are based on the nature of the assets:

- land and buildings: loss of rent or early termination of a lease;

- operating assets related to the business (assets of the CGU): ratio of net carrying amount of store assets
divided by sales (including VAT) higher than a defined level determined separately for each store category;

- assets allocated to administrative activities (headquarters and warehouses): site closure or obsolescence of
equipment used at the site.

Recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is
generally determined separately for each asset. When this is not possible, the recoverable amount of the group
of CGUs to which the asset belongs is used.

Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction
between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. In the retail industry, fair value less costs to
sell is generally determined on the basis of a sales or EBITDA multiple.

Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of an asset
plus a terminal value. It is determined internally or by external experts on the basis of:

- cash flow projections contained usually in business plans covering three years. Cash flows beyond this
projection period are usually estimated over a period of three years by applying a growth rate as determined
by management (generally constant);

- a terminal value determined by applying a perpetual growth rate to the final year's cash flow projection.

The cash flows and terminal value are discounted at long-term after-tax market rates reflecting market estimates
of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset.

Impairment losses
An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or the CGU to which it belongs is
greater than its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recorded as an expense under "Other operating
income and expenses".

Impairment losses recognised in a prior period are reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
However, the increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss may not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset in prior years. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed.


**10.5.1 Movements for the year**

Net impairment losses recognised in 2018 on goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and
investment property totalled €68 million (Note 6.5), of which €24 million arose from restructuring operations (mainly in
the France Retail segment) and €43 million corresponded to write-downs of individual assets (mainly in the France
Retail segment for €41 million and the E-commerce segment for €4 million).


-----

Following the tests carried out in 2017, impairment losses totalling €76 million had been recognised on goodwill,
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, of which €11 million arose from restructuring operations mainly
in the France Retail segment and €63 million corresponded to write-downs of individual assets (primarily in the
France Retail and Latam Retail segments).

**10.5.2 Goodwill impairment losses**

Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which
the goodwill is allocated and comparing them with the carrying amounts of the relevant assets. Goodwill arising on
the initial acquisition of networks is allocated to the groups of CGUs in accordance with the classifications presented
in Note 10.1.1. Some goodwill may also occasionally be allocated directly to CGUs.

Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amount of each CGU based on value in use, in
accordance with the principles described in Note 10.1. Value in use is determined by the discounted cash flows
method, based on after-tax cash flows and using the following rates.

Assumptions used in 2018 for internal calculations of values in use

**2018 perpetual** **2018 after-tax** **2017 perpetual** **2017 after-tax**
**Region**

**growth rate[(i)]** **discount rate[(ii)]** **growth rate[(i)]** **discount rate[(ii)]**

France (retailing) **1.9%** **5.6%** 1.8% 5.6%

France (other businesses) **1.9% and 2.4%** **5.6% and 7.7%** 1.8% and 2.3% 5.6% and 7.0%

Argentina **4.9%** **14.4%** 8.8% 15.5%

Colombia[(iii)] **3.0%** **9.0%** 3.0% 8.8%

Uruguay **6.1%** **11.2%** 6.1% 11.8%

(i) The inflation-adjusted perpetual growth rate ranges from 0% to 1.5% depending on the nature of the CGU's business/banner
and country.
(ii) The discount rate corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each country. WACC is calculated at least
once a year during the annual impairment testing exercise by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk premium
and the Group's cost of debt for France and the local cost of debt for subsidiaries outside France.
(iii) As at 31 December 2018, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €4,863 million,
€1,490 million and €1,243 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than the
carrying amount of the subsidiaries' net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based on their
value in use (see below).

No impairment loss was recognised as at 31 December 2018 from the annual goodwill impairment test conducted at
the end of the year.

With the exception of Franprix-Leader Price, in view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying
amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key assumptions
set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers reasonably foreseeable
changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 25-basis point decrease in the
perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point decrease in the EBITDA margin for the
cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value.

The recoverable amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU was determined by reference to its value in use,
calculated from cash flow projections based on three-year financial budgets approved by Senior Management,
extrapolation of projections over a period of three years, a terminal value calculated from perpetual capitalisation of
notional annual cash flow based on cash flows taken from the last year of forecasts, and a 5.6% discount rate (2017:
5.6%).


-----

The cash flow projections for the budget period were based on the following assumptions:

 - optimisation of the Leader Price store base.

 - ongoing deployment of a banner strategy based on a balance between integrated management stores and
franchisees.

 - restoration of the two banners’ profitability (EBITDA margins) to a rate in line with the historical average, led by
larger product volumes and optimised store and upstream function cost bases.

Management believes that a change in a key assumption could result in a carrying amount greater than the
recoverable amount. The table below shows the individual change in each of the key assumptions that would be
required for the estimated recoverable amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU to be the same as its carrying
amount (including €2,693 million in goodwill).

**Change required for the Franprix-Leader Price CGU's carrying amount**

**31 December 2018[(i)]** **31 December 2017**

**to be the same as its recoverable amount**

After-tax discount rate (5.6%) **+100 bps** +90 bps

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (0%) **-130 bps** -110 bps

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-130 bps** -125 bps

(i) A reasonable 100-bps increase in the discount rate, and/or a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the cash flow
projection, would result in the carrying amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU exceeding its recoverable amount by between
€0 and €260 million.

**10.5.3 Trademark impairment losses**

The recoverable amounts of trademarks were estimated at the year-end using the discounted cash flows method.
The main trademarks concern GPA. The Extra banner’s trademark (representing a carrying amount of €404 million as
at 31 December 2018) is the most exposed to a risk of impairment. However, the tests carried out as at
31 December 2018 did not reveal any evidence that the trademark's carrying amount might not be recoverable.

The table below shows the individual change in each of the key assumptions that would be required for the estimated
recoverable amount of the Extra trademark to be the same as its carrying amount:

**Change required for the Extra trademark's carrying amount to be the same as its recoverable**

**31 December 2018[(i)]**

**amount**

After-tax discount rate (10.1%) **+100 bps**

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (1.5%) **-125 bps**

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-70 bps**

(i) A 100-bps increase in the discount rate, combined with a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the cash flow
projection and a 25-bps decrease in the perpetual growth rate, would result in the carrying amount of the Extra CGU (including
the trademark) exceeding its recoverable amount by approximately €280 million.

#### Note 11 Financial structure and finance costs

Following the first-time application of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 (Note 1.3.2), the Group revised its accounting
policy for financial instruments.

**Accounting principle**

**Financial assets**

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs in the case of
instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs of financial
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in the income statement.

Financial assets are classified in the following three categories:

- Financial assets at amortised cost

- Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The classification depends on the business model within which the financial asset is held and the characteristics
of the instrument’s contractual cash flows.

Financial assets are classified as current if they are due in less than one year at the closing date and
non-current if they are due in more than one year.

**_FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST_**
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost when (i) they are not designated as financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss, (ii) they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows and (iii) they give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding (“SPPI” criterion).
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, determined using the effective interest method, less any
expected impairment losses in relation to the credit risk. Interest income, exchange gains and losses,
impairment losses and gains and losses arising on derecognition are all recorded in the income statement.
This category primarily includes trade receivables (except for GPA credit card receivables), cash and cash
equivalents as well as other loans and receivables.
Long-term loans and receivables that are not interest-bearing or that bear interest at a below-market rate are
discounted when the amounts involved are material.


**_FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI)_**
This category comprises debt instruments and equity instruments.

- Debt instruments are measured at fair value through OCI when (i) they are not designated as financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss, (ii) they are held within a business model whose objective is
achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and (iii) they give rise to cash
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (“SPPI”
criterion). Interest income, exchange gains and losses and impairment losses are recorded in the income
statement. Other net gains and losses are recorded in OCI. When the debt instrument is derecognised, the
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss.
This category mainly consists of GPA credit card receivables.

 - Equity instruments that are not held for trading may also be measured at fair value through OCI. This
method may be chosen separately for each investment. The choice is irrevocable. Dividends received are
recognised in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the
investment. Other gains and losses are recorded in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. At
present, the Group’s use of this option is non-material.


**_FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS_**
All financial assets that are not classified as financial assets at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI are
measured at fair value through profit or loss. Gain and losses on these assets, including interest or dividend
income, are recorded in the income statement.
This category mainly comprises derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and investments
in non-consolidated companies.

**_CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS_**
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments.
To be classified as cash equivalents under IAS 7, investments must be:

- short-term investments;

- highly liquid investments;

- readily convertible to known amounts of cash;

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Usually, the Group uses interest bearing bank accounts or term deposits of less than three months.


-----

**_IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS_**
IFRS 9 requires the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses on financial assets. This impairment model
applies to financial assets at amortised cost (including cash-based instruments), contract assets and debt
instruments at fair value through OCI.
The main financial assets concerned are trade receivables relating to Brazilian credit activities, trade receivables
from franchisees and affiliated stores and rent receivables.
For trade and rent receivables and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach provided for in
IFRS 9. This approach consists of estimating lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition, usually using a
provision matrix that specifies provision rates depending on the number of days that a receivable is past due.
For other financial assets, the Group applies the general impairment model.

**_DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS_**
Financial assets are derecognised in the following two cases:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired; or,

- the contractual rights have been transferred. In this latter case:

   - if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred, the
asset is derecognised in full;

   - if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group, the financial asset
continues to be recognised in the statement of financial position for its total amount.


**Financial liabilities**
Financial liabilities are classified as current if they are due in less than one year at the closing date and
non-current if they are due in more than one year.

The accounting treatment of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests (“NCI puts”) is described
in Note 3.4.1.

**_FINANCIAL LIABILITIES RECOGNISED AT AMORTISED COST_**
Borrowings and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at the fair value of the
consideration received, and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Transaction
costs and issue and redemption premiums directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability
are deducted from the liability's carrying amount. The costs are then amortised over the life of the liability by the
effective interest method.
Within the Group, some loans and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are hedged.
Several subsidiaries have set up reverse factoring programmes with financial institutions to enable their
suppliers to collect receivables more quickly in the ordinary course of the purchasing process. The accounting
policy for these transactions depends on whether or not the characteristics of the liabilities concerned have been
changed. For example, when trade payables are not substantially modified (term and due date, consideration,
face value) they continue to be recorded under "Trade payables". Otherwise, they are qualified as financing
transactions and included in financial liabilities under "Trade payables – structured programme".

**_FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS_**
These are mainly derivative instruments (see below). There are no financial liabilities intended to be held on a
short-term basis for trading purposes. They are measured at fair value and gains and losses arising from
remeasurement at fair value are recognised in the income statement. The Group does not hold any financial
liabilities for trading other than derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

**Derivative instruments**

All derivative instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position and measured at fair value.

**_DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING: RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION_**
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group applies hedge accounting to:

- fair value hedges of a liability (for example, swaps to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate); the hedged
item is recognised at fair value and any change in fair value is recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses
arising from remeasurement of the hedge at fair value are also recognised in profit or loss. If the hedge is
entirely effective, the loss or gain on the hedged debt is offset by the gain or loss on the derivative;

- cash flow hedges (for example, swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate or to change the borrowing
currency, and hedges of budgeted purchases billed in a foreign currency). For these hedges, the ineffective
portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in profit or loss and the effective portion
is recognised in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to profit or loss on a
symmetrical basis with the hedged cash flows in terms of both timing and classification (i.e., in trading profit
for hedges of operating cash flows and in net financial income and expense for other hedges). The
premium/discount component of forward foreign exchange contracts is treated as a hedging cost. Changes
in the fair value of this component are recorded in "Other comprehensive income" and reclassified to profit
or loss as part of the cost of the hedged transaction on the transaction date (basis of adjustment method);

- hedges of net investments in foreign operations. For these hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair
value attributable to the hedged foreign currency risk is recognised net of tax in other comprehensive


-----

income and the ineffective portion is recognised directly in financial income or expense. Gains or losses
accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss on the date of liquidation or
disposal of the net investment.


Hedge accounting may only be used if:

- the hedging instruments and hedged items included in the hedging relationship are all eligible for hedge
accounting;

- the hedging relationship is clearly defined and documented at inception; and

- the effectiveness of the hedge can be demonstrated at inception and throughout its life.

**_DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING: RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION_**
When a derivative financial instrument does not qualify or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, successive
changes in its fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss for the period under “Other financial income and
expenses”.

**Definition of net debt**

Net debt corresponds to loans and other borrowings including derivatives designed as fair value hedge
(liabilities) and trade payables – structured programme, less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets
held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii) derivatives designated as fair value
hedge (assets), (iv) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets and (v) net assets
held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary.

(i) Syndicated credit lines comprise a €1,200 million line expiring in February 2021 and a USD 750 million line expiring in
July 2022. Interest is based on Euribor (drawdowns in euros) or US Libor (drawdowns in US dollars) for the drawdown period
plus a spread that depends on the amount borrowed and the Group's net debt/EBITDA ratio.
(ii) Interest on the bilateral credit lines is based on the Euribor for the drawdown period plus a spread. In some cases, the spread
varies depending on the amount borrowed (lines totalling €240 million) and/or the Group's net debt/EBITDA ratio (lines totalling
€250 million). For one line, the spread is partially indexed to the Group's Sustainalytics CSR rating.
(iii) Interest on the other lines is based on the reference rate (which depends on the borrowing currency) plus a spread. In some
cases, the spread varies depending on the subsidiary's net debt/EBITDA ratio (lines totalling €370 million) and/or the amount
borrowed (lines totalling €450 million).
(iv) The other confirmed bank credit lines concern Monoprix (€570 million), GPA (€405 million) and Éxito (€161 million).

###### 11.3 Net financial income (expense)


**Accounting principle**

**Net finance costs**

Net finance costs correspond to all income and expenses generated by cash and cash equivalents and financial
liabilities during the period, including income from cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses on disposals of
cash equivalents, interest expense on financial liabilities, gains and losses on interest rate hedges (including the
ineffective portion) and related currency effects, and trade payable – structured programme costs.

**Other financial income and expenses**

This item corresponds to financial income and expenses that are not included in net finance costs.

It includes dividends received from non-consolidated companies, non-recourse factoring and associated
transaction costs, discounting adjustments (including to provisions for pensions and other post-employment
benefit obligations), gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value of equity derivatives, and
impairment losses and realised gains and losses on financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents.
Exchange gains and losses are also recorded under this caption, apart from (i) exchange gains and losses on
cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities, which are presented under net finance costs, and (ii) the
effective portion of accounting hedges of operating transactions, which are included in trading profit.

Financial discounts for prompt payments are recognised in financial income for the portion corresponding to the
normal market interest rate and as a deduction from cost of goods sold for the supplement.

(i) The net loss of €44 million on remeasurement at fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments reported in 2018 mainly
reflects (a) fair value adjustments to the GPA TRS (positive adjustment of €5 million) and GPA forward (negative
adjustment of €17 million) as well as dividend income (€3 million) and the cost of carry (€14 million) associated with these
instruments, and (b) negative impacts related to other derivative instruments (€3 million). The net gain of €47 million on
remeasurement at fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments reported in 2017 mainly reflected (a) positive fair value
adjustments to the GPA TRS (€32 million) and GPA forward (€51 million), less the cost of carry associated with these
instruments (€15 million); and (b) negative fair value adjustments to other derivative instruments (€21 million).
(ii) Including BRL 101 million (€23 million) in interest recognised by GPA on the Paes Mendonça receivable (Note 6.9.1).

**GPA TRS and forward**

The total return swap (TRS) and forward contracts on GPA shares are cash-settled instruments. The documentation
states that when the contracts expire, the shares will be sold on the market by the banking counterparties, and the
Group will receive or pay the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid by the counterparties to
purchase the shares at the contracts' inception. The Group retains the economic benefits of ownership of the shares
(exposure to changes in the subsidiaries' share prices and collection of dividends) but does not have legal title to the
shares and cannot exercise the related voting rights. Details of the contracts are as follows:

- In December 2011, the Group entered into a 2.5-year TRS with a financial institution on 7.9 million GPA American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The contract's maturity was extended on 23 December 2016 and again on
27 October 2017. The interest rate is currently set at the 3-month Euribor plus 199 bps and the contract expires in
June 2020. This TRS is a derivative instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31 December
2018, it related to 7.8 million ADRs (2.9% of GPA’s capital) representing a notional amount of €332 million, and
had a negative fair value of €172 million (31 December 2017: 7.8 million ADRs, a notional amount of €332 million
and a negative fair value of €177 million).

- At the end of December 2012, the Group entered into a 2-year forward contract with a financial institution on
5.8 million GPA shares. On 28 July 2016, the maturity was extended and the notional amount was reduced by
USD 105 million (€95 million), resulting in a cash payment made by the Group on the same day. The maturity was
extended again in June 2017. The interest rate currently corresponds to the 3-month Libor plus 204 bps and the
contract expires in February 2020. This forward is a derivative instrument measured at fair value through profit or
loss. As at 31 December 2018, it related to 5.8 million shares (2.2% of GPA's capital) representing a notional
amount of USD 239 million (€209 million), and had a negative fair value of €101 million (31 December 2017: 5.8
million shares, a notional amount of USD 239 million (€199 million) and a negative fair value of €83 million).

These instruments' fair value is determined based on the estimated settlement price on 31 December, using the
share price on that date. The instruments had a negative fair value of €272 million as at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: negative fair value of €260 million) (Note 11.5.1).
A 10% increase in the share price would have reduced the loss for the period by €25 million. A 10% decline in the
share price would have produced the opposite effect.

###### 11.4 Fair value of financial instruments


**Accounting principle**

Fair value measurements are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs
used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);

- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e., as prices) or
indirectly (i.e., derived from prices) (Level 2);

- inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is the quoted price on the reporting date.
A market is considered active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer,
broker, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm's length basis. These instruments are classified as Level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments which are not quoted in an active market (such as over-the-counter
derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques use observable market data wherever
possible and make little use of the Group's own estimates. If all the inputs required to calculate fair value are
observable, the instrument is classified as Level 2.

If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as Level 3.


**11.4.1 Financial assets and liabilities by category of instrument**

**FINANCIAL ASSETS**

The tables below analyse financial assets according to the new measurement categories used as from
1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 and the original categories used in 2017 under IAS 39. The corresponding
reclassifications are presented in Note 1.3.2.
In 2017, the Group did not hold any assets that would have been classified in the categories "financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss" or "held-to-maturity financial assets".

(i) The fair value of financial assets at fair value (presented in 2017 in the category “available-for-sale financial assets”) is generally
measured using standard valuation techniques. If their fair value cannot be determined reliably, they are not included in this
note.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments are valued (internally or externally) on the basis of the widely used valuation techniques for this
type of instrument. Valuation models are based on observable market inputs (mainly the yield curve) and counterparty quality.
Derivatives held as fair value hedges are almost fully backed by borrowings.
(iii) The fair value of bonds is based on the latest quoted price on the reporting date.
(iv) The fair value of other borrowings has been measured using other valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow
method, taking into account the Group's credit risk and interest rate conditions at the reporting date.
(v) The fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests is measured by applying the contract’s calculation
formulas and is discounted, if necessary. These formulas are considered to be representative of fair value and notably use net
profit multiples (Note 3.4.1).

###### 11.5 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The main risks associated with the Group's financial instruments are market risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate
risk and equity risk), counterparty risk and liquidity risk.

Financial risk monitoring and management is the responsibility of the Corporate Finance department, which is part of
the Group Finance department. This team manages all financial exposures in coordination with the finance
departments of the Group's main subsidiaries and reports to Senior Management. It has issued a Good Financial
Practice Guide governing all financing, investment and hedging transactions carried out by Group entities.

Financing, short-term investment and financial risk management policies are overseen by the Corporate finance
department in coordination with the subsidiaries' finance departments, using a conservative and pro-active approach
particularly with respect to counterparty and liquidity risk management. Major transactions are monitored individually.

The Group Corporate Finance department has issued a guide to financing, investment and hedging best practices
which is distributed to subsidiary Finance departments. The guide sets out financing methods, selection criteria for
banking partners, appropriate hedging products and required authorisation levels.

The French and international business units' cash positions and forecasts are reported weekly and continuously
monitored. The Group's other financial risk exposures, such as interest rate risk, currency risk on financial
transactions and banking counterparty risk, are measured and analysed in monthly reports to Senior Management
that also include action plans for dealing with any material identified risks.

The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risks and foreign currency risks using standard derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps and options (caps, floors, swaptions), currency swaps, forward currency
contracts and currency options. These instruments are mainly over-the-counter instruments contracted with first-tier
bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting.
Like many other large corporates, the Group may take very small, strictly controlled positions that do not qualify for
hedge accounting, for more dynamic and flexible management of its interest rate and currency exposures.

As at 31 December 2018, derivatives held as fair value hedges (on a notional amount of €5,261 million) had a positive
net fair value of €98 million. The total included (i) interest rate hedges in France on a notional amount of €4,663 million
with a positive fair value of €53 million and (ii) currency and interest rate hedges in Brazil on a notional amount of
€199 million with a positive fair value of €19 million, and in Colombia on a notional amount of €399 million with a
positive fair value of €25 million. All the currency and interest rate derivatives are backed by bank borrowings or bonds
denominated either in the same currency or in a currency other than the borrower entity's functional currency. The
ineffective portion of these fair value hedges is not material.

-----

As at 31 December 2018, the cash flow hedge reserve included in equity had a debit balance of €8 million
(31 December 2017: debit balance of €16 million after tax). These derivatives concern operations in France and
Colombia. In France, they hedge goods purchases billed in currencies other than the euro (mainly the US dollar). Their
notional amount as at 31 December 2018 was USD 159 million (€143 million – Note 11.5.2). In Colombia, the notional
amount hedged by the derivatives is €73 million. Both France and Colombia apply cash flow hedge accounting
regarding the hedging of interest rates on variable rate borrowings for notional amounts of €2,849 million and €513
million, respectively, at 31 December 2018. The ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is not material.

Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 had a negative fair value of €263 million
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: negative fair value of €260 million), including TRSs and forward contracts
on GPA shares with a negative fair value of €272 million (31 December 2017: negative fair value of €260 million)
(Note 11.3.2).

The fair value calculation as at 31 December 2018 takes into account the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and the
debit valuation adjustment (DVA) in accordance with IFRS 13. The impact of these adjustments is not material.

**11.5.2 Market risk**

**INTEREST RATE RISK**

The Group's objective is to manage its exposure to the risk of interest rate changes and optimise its financing cost. Its
strategy therefore consists of dynamic debt management by monitoring and, where necessary, adjusting its hedging
ratio based on forecast trends in interest rates.

Interest rate risks are managed using various vanilla instruments. The main instruments are interest rate swaps and
options (caps, floors and swaptions). These instruments do not always qualify for hedge accounting; however all
interest-rate instruments are contracted in line with the above risk management policy.

Specifically, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt is mainly composed of fixed-rate bonds (representing a principal
amount of €5,338 million as at 31 December 2018 – Note 11.2.3). This bond debt may be hedged through
fixed-to-variable rate swaps generally contracted at the issue date; all of these hedges qualify for hedge accounting.

As at 31 December 2018, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon had a portfolio of 68 interest rate swaps and options with a
dozen bank counterparties. These instruments expire at various dates between 2019 and 2026.
As at 31 December 2018, 66% of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon’s bond debt (€3,524 million) was hedged – including
31% at fixed rates (€1,677 million) and 35% at capped variable rates (€1,847 million) – and 34% was at variable rates
(€1,814 million).

(Note 11.2.3), including a principal amount of €3,660 million (31 December 2017: €3,572 million) swapped for variable rate debt,
of which €1,847 million is hedged by interest rate options.
(ii) Principal amount.

(iv) Including borrowings in Brazil originally denominated in BRL, USD or euros for BRL 974 million (€219 million) swapped for
variable rate debt in BRL by means of cross-currency swaps where applicable (31 December 2017: BRL 1,137 million,
representing €286 million).
(v) Including borrowings in Colombia originally denominated in COP or USD for COP 1,860 billion (€499 million), swapped for
variable rate debt in COP by means of cross-currency swaps where applicable (31 December 2017: COP 2,581 billion,
representing €721 million, swapped for variable rate debt).

Assuming the net debt structure and management policy are constant, a 100-bps annual increase (decrease) in rates
across the yield curve would lead to a 3.9% or €13 million increase (2.0% or €7 million decrease) in finance costs.
For the purposes of the analysis, all other variables, particularly exchange rates, are assumed to be constant.

**EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK**
Due to its geographically diversified business base, the Group is exposed to both currency translation risk on the
translation of the balance sheets and income statements of subsidiaries outside the euro zone and to transaction risk
on transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro.
Translation risk (or balance sheet currency risk) is the risk of an unfavourable change in the exchange rates used to
translate the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone into euros for inclusion in the
consolidated financial statements adversely affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated statement of financial
position and income statement, leading to a deterioration of the Group's financial structure ratios.
Transaction risk is the risk of an unfavourable change in exchange rates that adversely affects a cash flow
denominated in foreign currency.

The Group's policy for managing transaction risk is to hedge highly probable budgeted exposures, which mainly
concern cash flows arising from purchases made in a currency other than the buyer’s functional currency and
particularly purchases in US dollars which are hedged using forward contracts. These instruments are mainly
over-the-counter instruments contracted with first-tier bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or derivative
instruments qualify for hedge accounting.
As a general principle, budgeted purchases are hedged using instruments with the same maturities as the underlying
transactions.
Currency risks on debts denominated in a currency other than the borrower’s functional currency are systematically
hedged, except where the debt represents a designated and documented hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation.


-----

The Group's net exposure based on notional amounts after hedging mainly concerns the US dollar (excluding the
functional currencies of entities), as shown below:

(i) Changes in fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests (including the effect of movements in
exchange rates) have no impact on profit or loss, because the puts are treated as transactions between owners and changes in
their fair value are therefore recorded directly in equity (Note 3.4.1).

As at 31 December 2017, the net statement of financial position exposure of €214 million mainly concerned the
US dollar.

**SENSITIVITY OF NET EXPOSURE AFTER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING**

A 10% appreciation of the euro as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 against the currencies included in the Group's
exposure would lead to an increase in profit for the amounts indicated in the table below.
For the purposes of the analysis, all other variables, particularly interest rates, are assumed to be constant.

**Impact on net financial income (expense)** **24** **21**

A 10% decline in the euro against those currencies as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 would have produced the
opposite effect.

**SENSITIVITY TO TRANSLATION RISK**

A 10% appreciation of the euro compared to the Group’s other main currencies would have the following impact on
the translation into euros of the sales, profit and equity of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro:

(i) In accordance with IAS 29, the financial statements of Libertad have been translated at the year-end exchange rate.

**EQUITY RISK**

As at 31 December 2018, the Group did not hold any significant investments in any listed companies other than its
listed subsidiaries or treasury shares.

The Group may use derivative instruments (e.g., total return swaps, forward contracts, puts and calls) on equities to
build a synthetic exposure to the shares of its listed subsidiaries (Note 11.3.2) or a synthetic hedge of a financial
exposure to a fall in stock prices. The carrying amount of these instruments corresponds to their estimated value as
provided by a financial institution on the reporting date. These values take account of market data such as exchange
rates, share prices and interest rates.

In addition, the Group does not hold any options or any derivatives backing its own shares. Its policy as regards cash
management is to invest only in money market instruments that are not exposed to equity risk.

**11.5.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group is exposed to various aspects of counterparty risk through its operating activities, cash deposits and
interest rate and currency hedging instruments. It monitors these risks regularly using several objective indicators,
and diversifies its exposure by dealing with the least risky counterparties (based mainly on their credit ratings and
their reciprocal commitments with the Group).

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO TRADE RECEIVABLES**

Customer credit risk:
Group policy consists of checking the financial health of all customers applying for credit payment terms. Customer
receivables are regularly monitored; consequently, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not material.

**31 December 2017** 728 69 36 34 **139** **153** **1,020**

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO OTHER ASSETS**

Credit risk on other financial assets – mainly comprising cash and cash equivalents, equity instruments, loans, legal
deposits paid by GPA and certain derivative financial instruments – corresponds to the risk of failure by the
counterparty to fulfil its obligations. The maximum risk is limited and equal to the instruments’ carrying amount. The
Group’s cash management policy consists of investing cash and cash equivalents with first-tier counterparties and in
first-tier rated instruments.

**11.5.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group's liquidity policy is to ensure, to the extent possible, that it always has sufficient liquid assets to settle its
liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market conditions.
The main methods used consist of:

- diversifying sources of financing to include capital markets, private placements, banks (confirmed and
unconfirmed facilities), negotiable European commercial paper (NEU CP) programmes and discounting
facilities;

- diversifying financing currencies to include the euro, the Group's other functional currencies and the US dollar;

- maintaining a level of confirmed financing facilities significantly in excess of the Group's payment obligations
at all times;

- limiting the amount of annual repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule;

- managing the average maturity of financing facilities and, where appropriate, refinancing them before they fall
due.

The liquidity analysis is performed both at the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon holding company level (taking into
account the cash pool operated with all French subsidiaries) and for each of the Group's international subsidiaries.

In addition, the Group has non-recourse receivables discounting programmes, with no continuing involvement in the
receivables within the meaning of IFRS 7, as well as reverse factoring programmes.
As at 31 December 2018, trade payables totalling €1,832 million had been reverse factored, including €704 million in
France Retail payables, €971 million in Latam Retail payables and €157 million in E-commerce payables.

Most of the Group's debt is carried by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and is not secured by collateral or any secured
assets. Financing is managed by the Corporate Finance department. The main subsidiaries (GPA, Monoprix and
Éxito) also have their own financing facilities, which are not secured by collateral or any security interests in assets
and are not guaranteed by Casino (except for GPA loans granted by BNDES totalling €8 million as at 31 December
2018 that are secured by assets).

All subsidiaries submit weekly cash reports to the Group and all new financing facilities require prior approval from
the Corporate Finance department.


-----

As at 31 December 2018, the Group's liquidity position comprised:

- confirmed, undrawn lines of credit for a total of €3,404 million (of which €2,865 million for France);

- available cash of €3,730 million.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon has a €9,000 million Euro medium term notes (EMTN) programme. Notes issued under
the programme totalled €5,338 million at 31 December 2018.

As at the same date, issuance under Casino, Guichard-Perrachon’s €2,000 million negotiable European commercial
paper (NEU CP) programme amounted to €221 million.

The Company's bonds (other than deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds) have been rated BB with negative outlook
by Standard & Poor's since 3 September 2018 (BB+ with a positive outlook previously) and Ba1 with negative outlook
by Moody's since 28 September 2018 (Ba1 with a stable outlook previously). In line with the policy of rotating rating
agencies, as recommended by the European regulator, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") was appointed as the
Group's new rating agency in 2017. Simultaneously with Moody's appointment, the Group terminated its contract with
Fitch Ratings; since 12 January 2018, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and its bond issues are no longer rated by Fitch.
The changes in Standard & Poor’s rating and outlook and Moody’s rating outlook in 2018 had no impact on Casino’s
borrowing costs or liquidity position.

The bond indentures (other than for deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds) include a step down clause providing for a
return to the original interest rate if Standard & Poor's and Moody’s restore Casino, Guichard Perrachon's investment
grade rating.

The Group's bank loan agreements and bond documentation include the usual pari passu negative pledge and cross
default clauses.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's facility agreements generally contain a mandatory acceleration clause in the event of a
change of control of the Company.

In addition, bonds issued by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon (except for the two deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds
issues) contain a discretionary acceleration clause applicable if the Company's long-term senior debt rating is
downgraded to non-investment grade (or further downgraded if the rating is already non-investment grade), but only if
this downgrade is due to a change of majority shareholder (i.e., if a third party other than Rallye or one of its related
companies acquires more than 50% of Casino's voting rights).

**CASINO,** **GUICHARD-PERRACHON DEBT COVENANTS**

At the reporting date, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt was subject to the following hard covenants to be met at
each year-end:


**Frequency of**

(iii) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) corresponds to trading profit plus recurring net
depreciation and amortisation expense.

The Group considers that it will very comfortably respect its covenants over the next 12 months.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's bonds and negotiable European commercial paper (NEU CP) issues are not subject to
any financial covenants.

**EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY RISK**

The table below presents an analysis by maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2018, including principal
and interest and for undiscounted amounts. For derivative financial instruments, the table has been drawn up based
on the contractual net cash inflows and outflows on instruments that settle on a net basis and the gross inflows and
outflows on those instruments that require gross settlement. For interest rate instruments, when the amount payable
or receivable is not fixed, the amount presented has been determined by reference to observed yield curves as at the
reporting date.

For the TRS and forward instruments described in Note 11.3.2, the cash flows presented in the table below reflect the
interest payable and the fair value of instruments as at the reporting date.

#### Note 12 Equity and earnings per share


**Accounting principle**

Equity is attributable to two categories of owner: the owners of the parent (Casino, Guichard-Perrachon
shareholders) and the owners of the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries. A non-controlling interest is the
equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.

Transactions with the owners of non-controlling interests resulting in a change in the parent company's
percentage interest without loss of control affect only equity as there is no change of control of the economic
entity. Cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a fully consolidated subsidiary that do not result
in a loss of control (including increases in percentage interest) are classified as cash flows from financing
activities.

In the case of an acquisition of an additional interest in a fully consolidated subsidiary, the Group recognises the
difference between the acquisition cost and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests as a change in
equity attributable to owners of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon. Transaction costs are also recognised in equity.
The same treatment applies to transaction costs relating to disposals without loss of control. In the case of
disposals of controlling interests involving a loss of control, the Group derecognises the whole of the ownership
interest and, where appropriate, recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value. The
gain or loss on the entire derecognised interest (interest sold and interest retained) is recognised in profit or loss
under "Other operating income" or "Other operating expenses", which amounts to remeasuring the retained
previously-held investment at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flows arising from the acquisition or loss of
control of a subsidiary are classified as cash flows from investing activities.

Equity instruments and hybrid instruments
The classification of instruments issued by the Group in equity or debt depends on each instrument's specific
characteristics. An instrument is deemed to be an equity instrument when the following two conditions are met:

  - the instrument does not contain a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to
another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions
that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; and

  - in the case of a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments, it is either a
non-derivative that does not include a contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of the entity's
own equity instruments, or it is a derivative that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of
cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.

The Group also examines the special provisions of contracts to ensure the absence of an indirect obligation to
buy back the equity instruments in cash or by delivering another financial asset or by delivering shares with a
value substantially higher than the amount of cash or the other financial asset to be delivered.

In particular, instruments that are redeemable at the Group's discretion and for which the remuneration depends
on the payment of a dividend are classified in equity.

When a "debt" component exists, it is measured separately and classified under "financial liabilities".

Equity transaction costs
External and qualifying internal costs directly attributable to equity transactions or transactions involving equity
instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity, net of tax. All other transaction costs are recognised as an
expense.

Treasury shares
Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares purchased by the Group are deducted from equity at cost. The proceeds
from sales of treasury shares are credited to equity with the result that any disposal gains or losses, net of the
related tax effect, have no impact in the income statement for the period.

Options on treasury shares
Options on treasury shares are treated as derivative instruments, equity instruments or financial liabilities
depending on their characteristics.

Options classified as derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Options classified as equity
instruments are recorded in equity at their initial amount and changes in value are not recognised. The
accounting treatment of financial liabilities is described in Note 11.

###### 12.1 Capital management

The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to preserve the confidence of investors, creditors and
the markets while ensuring the financial headroom required to support the Group's future business development. The
Group aims to continually optimise its financial structure by maintaining an optimum balance between net debt,
EBITDA and equity. To this end, it may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return part of the capital
to shareholders, buy back its own shares or issue new shares. From time to time, the Group may buy back its own
shares in the market. The shares are generally acquired for allocation to a liquidity contract used to make a market in
the shares, or to be held for allocation under stock option plans, employee share ownership plans or free share plans
for Group employees and corporate officers.

The policy objectives and management procedures are exactly the same as in previous years.

Apart from legal requirements, the Group is not subject to any external minimum capital requirements.

###### 12.2 Share capital

At 31 December 2018, the Company’s share capital amounted to €167,886,006 (31 December 2017: €169,825,404
and was composed of 109,729,416 ordinary shares issued and fully paid as at that date (31 December 2017:
110,996,996 shares).
The decrease was mainly due to the cancellation of (i) 413,622 shares by the Board of Directors on 7 March 2018,
(ii) 335,909 shares by the Board of Directors on 15 May 2018, and (iii) 518,077 shares by the Board of Directors on
25 July 2018, representing a total of €55 million of which €2 million corresponding to the shares’ aggregate par value.
The shares have a par value of €1.53.

Under the shareholder authorisations given to the Board of Directors, the share capital may be increased,
immediately or in the future, by up to €59 million.

###### 12.3 Share equivalents

The Group is committed to granting free shares under various plans (Note 8.3). The Group intends to fulfil its
obligations under those plans by delivering existing shares when the related rights vest.

###### 12.4 Treasury shares

Treasury shares result from shareholder-approved buybacks of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. shares. As at
31 December 2018, a total of 961,761 shares were held in treasury, representing €33 million (31 December 2017:
107,735 shares representing €5 million. The shares were purchased primarily for allocation upon exercise of the
rights under free share plans.

In January 2005, the Group entered into a liquidity agreement with the Rothschild investment bank for a total of
700,000 Casino shares plus a contribution of €40 million in cash, in compliance with European Commission
Regulation (EC) No. 2273/2003. The Group made additional contributions to the liquidity agreement of (i) €30 million
on 25 September 2015 and (ii) €50 million on 28 December 2015. The 700,000 shares were subsequently cancelled
by decision of the Board of Directors on 14 June 2016.

As at 31 December 2018, no Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. shares were held in the liquidity account
(31 December 2017: no shares).


-----

In January 2019, the Group signed a new liquidity agreement with Rothschild Martin Maurel to take account of the
changes in regulations governing such agreements, in accordance with AMF decision 2018-01 dated 2 July 2018.
The new agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 2019, replaces the previous one. On the date of signature
of the contract in January 2019, €30 million in cash was held in the liquidity contract and no shares.
Purchases and sales of treasury shares during 2018 led to a €100 million reduction in equity, net of tax (€103 million
before tax, corresponding to the net cash outflow for the period).

###### 12.5 Deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI)

At the beginning of 2005, the Group issued 600,000 deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI) for a total amount
of €600 million. The notes are redeemable solely at the Group's discretion and interest payments are due only if the
Group pays a dividend on its ordinary shares in the preceding 12 months. The bonds pay interest at the 10-year
constant maturity swap rate plus 100 bps, capped at 9%. In 2018, the average coupon was 1.93% (2017: 1.71%).

On 18 October 2013, the Group issued €750 million worth of perpetual hybrid bonds (7,500 bonds) on the market.
The bonds are redeemable at the Company's discretion with the first call date set for 31 January 2019 (not exercised)
and the second on 31 January 2024. The bonds paid interest at 4.87% until 31 January 2019. Since then, as
specified in the prospectus, the interest rate has been reset at 3.992%. This rate will be reset every five years.

Given their specific characteristics in terms of maturity and remuneration, the bonds are carried in equity for the
amount of €1,350 million. Issuance costs net of tax have been recorded as a deduction from equity.

(iii) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists mainly of exchange differences arising on translation of foreign subsidiaries'

GPA's capital consists of:
    - 99,680 thousand ordinary shares with voting rights;
    - 167,165 thousand preferred shares without voting rights but with the right to a preferred dividend.
Preferred shares do not carry voting rights, but instead entitle holders to the following rights and benefits:
    - preferred right to a return of capital in the event of liquidation of the company;
    - an annual non-cumulative preferred dividend of at least BRL 0.08 per share;
    - a second preferred dividend equal to 10% more than the dividend paid on ordinary shares, as calculated
including the non-cumulative dividend referred to above.
Casino has not granted any put options to holders of non-controlling interests in GPA. Under Brazilian securities
regulations, preferred shareholders have withdrawal rights enabling them to ask GPA to buy back their shares at
book value (i.e., net asset value per share) following the occurrence of certain specific events. These rights are
described in detail on pages 94 et seq. of GPA's annual report for 2017 on Form 20-F.

###### 12.9 Dividends

At the Annual General Meeting of 15 May 2018, the shareholders approved the payment of a €3.12 cash dividend per
ordinary share for the 2017 financial year. Including the interim dividend of €173 million paid in December 2017, the
dividend was paid on 107,866,474 shares, representing a total payout in 2018 of €168 million recorded as a
deduction from equity.

During its meeting on 12 November 2018, the Board of Directors decided to pay an interim dividend for 2018 of €1.56
per share and this was duly paid on 5 December 2018. The interim dividend was paid on 108,756,207 shares,
representing a total payout of €170 million recorded as a deduction from equity. In all, dividends paid in 2018 had a
€338 million impact on equity.

Note that dividends for 2016 amounted to €344 million, including interim dividends of €171 million paid in 2016 and
final dividends of €173 million paid in 2017.

The Board of Directors will recommend setting the 2018 dividend at €3.12 per ordinary share. Based on
109,729,416 shares as at 31 December 2018, the recommended dividend represents a provisional amount of
€342 million which includes the interim dividend of €170 million paid in December 2018 (see above). It will be
adjusted in 2019 to take into account the treasury shares held on the payment date. The financial statements
presented before appropriation of profit do not reflect this dividend, which is subject to shareholder approval at the
next Annual General Meeting.

###### 12.10 Earnings per share


**Accounting principle**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period, excluding shares issued in payment of dividends and treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are
calculated by the treasury stock method, as follows:

- numerator: earnings for the period are adjusted for dividends on deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds;

- denominator: the basic number of shares is adjusted to include potential shares corresponding to dilutive
instruments (equity warrants, stock options and free shares), less the number of shares that could be
bought back at market price with the proceeds from the exercise of the dilutive instruments. The market
price used for the calculation corresponds to the average share price for the year.

Equity instruments that will or may be settled in Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares are included in the
calculation only when their settlement would have a dilutive impact on earnings per share.

#### Note 13 Other provisions

**Accounting principle**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are discounted when the
related adjustment is material.
In accordance with the above principle, a provision is recorded for the cost of repairing equipment sold with a
warranty. The provision represents the estimated cost of repairs to be performed during the warranty period, as
estimated on the basis of actual costs incurred in prior years. Each year, part of the provision is reversed to
offset the actual repair costs recognised in expenses.

A provision for restructuring expenses is recorded when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure.
This is the case when management has drawn up a detailed, formal plan and has raised a valid expectation in
those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by announcing its main features to them before the
period-end.

Other provisions concern specifically identified liabilities and expenses.

Contingent liabilities correspond to possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control, or
present obligations whose settlement is not expected to require an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but are disclosed in the
Notes to the financial statements.

###### 13.3 Contingent assets and liabilities

In the normal course of its business, the Group is involved in a number of legal or arbitration proceedings with third
parties or with the tax authorities in certain countries (mainly involving GPA – see below).

As stated in Note 3.3.5, no associates or joint ventures have any significant contingent liabilities.

- **Class action against Cnova N.V. and the Group**

Some of the officers and directors of Cnova N.V. and the underwriters of its IPO were named in a class action before
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a breach of United States securities
laws. The lawsuit claimed that misleading information was issued at the time of the IPO concerning the
macro-economic situation in Brazil and the irregularities uncovered at Cnova Brazil. On 19 March 2018, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York announced its final approval of the proposed settlement of
this class action for an amount of USD 28.5 million. The USD 28.5 million was paid in first-half 2018 (see Note 11.1)
and most of the amount was covered by an insurance settlement received from Cnova's insurers. The balance,
including estimated related costs, was covered by the provision recorded in 2016. Consequently, the settlement had
no material impact on the Group’s net profit.
On 14 December 2018, Cnova was informed by the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it
had completed the investigation into stock management issues and the audit of Cnova’s former subsidiary in Brazil
launched in December 2015 and that it was not planning to take any action against Cnova. No penalties were levied
on Cnova concerning this matter.

- **Arbitration between GPA and Peninsula**

On 12 September 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro Peninsula
("Peninsula") in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related to leasing
agreements concerning stores owned by Peninsula and operated by GPA. The lease contracts have a duration of
20 years as from 2005 and are automatically renewable for another 20-year period.
Despite the discussions concerning application of the lease terms, the request for arbitration has no impact on the
operation of the leased stores, which is contractually guaranteed. At this stage of the arbitration process, it is not
possible to make a reasonable estimate of the related risk. Based on the opinion of its legal advisors, the Company
considers as possible the risk of an unfavourable ruling by the arbitration board.

- **Proceedings brought by the DGCCRF (French competition authority) against AMC and INCAA**
**and investigations by the French and European competition authorities**

On 28 February 2017, the French Ministry of the Economy, represented by the Department of Competition Policy,
Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), brought an action against Casino in the Paris Commercial Court.
The case involves a series of credit notes totalling €22.2 million issued in 2013 and 2014 by 41 suppliers. The
DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned together with a fine of €2 million.
Also, on 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and its parent companies Intermarché and
Casino, were prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices that allegedly took place in 2015
against 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a fine of €2 million.
The proceedings in both cases are still in progress.
The Group considers that it complied with the applicable regulations during negotiations with the suppliers concerned
by both sets of proceedings. Consequently, no provision has been set aside for these matters.

Moreover, the Group is undergoing two inquiries by the French and European competition authorities.
In early February 2017, representatives of France’s Competition Authority raided the premises of Vindémia Logistique
and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply and distribution
activities on Reunion Island. At this stage, the Competition Authority has not issued any complaint. The Casino Group
has contested the legitimacy of the raids before the Court of Cassation. The Group is not currently able to predict the
outcome of the investigation.
At the end of February 2017, representatives of the European Commission raided the premises of Achats
Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino Achats (INCA-A), in
connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services
to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers.
INCA-A has ceased operations since the raids took place. At this stage, the European Commission has not issued
any complaint. The Casino Group has contested the legitimacy of the raids before the General Court of the European
Union. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of this matter.
The preliminary investigations are still in progress and there were no significant developments in 2018.

In June 2018, after giving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, the French
Competition Authority launched an informal investigation into the creation of joint purchasing organisations in the food
retailing sector. The investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing organisation set up between
Auchan, Casino, Metro and Schiever. It is still in progress.

(i) Contingent liabilities of Via Varejo classified in discontinued operations and not included in the above table amount to
€365 million as at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: €407 million).

GPA employs consulting firms to advise it in tax disputes, whose fees are contingent on the disputes being settled in
GPA's favour. As at 31 December 2018, the estimated amount was €38 million (31 December 2017: €40 million).

Casino has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax adjustments received
from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,317 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
BRL 1,223 million), including penalties and interest. Under the terms of the guarantee, Casino has undertaken to
indemnify GPA for 50% of any damages incurred, provided those damages are definitive. Based on the commitment
given by Casino to its subsidiary, the risk exposure amounts to BRL 658 million (€148 million) at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: BRL 611 million, representing €154 million). As the risks of liability are only considered possible,
Casino has not recognised a provision in its financial statements for this amount.


-----

- **GPA contingent assets**

Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base:

Since the introduction of non-cumulative PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has asserted the right to deduct ICMS tax
from the base used to calculate PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by a Brazilian federal
supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the PIS and COFINS tax
base. Based on the STF’s ruling and the opinion of its internal and external advisors, GPA considered that the
probability of having to settle the amounts deducted in prior periods was low. It therefore released in first-half 2017
the corresponding provisions set up in prior periods for an amount of BRL 117 million (€32 million).

Since the supreme court’s ruling on 15 March 2017, the procedure has continued in line with the expectations of GPA
and its advisors, without GPA’s judgement being called into question concerning the release of the provisions,
although the court has not yet handed down its final decision. GPA and its external legal advisors believe that this
decision concerning the application method will not limit its rights under the legal proceedings brought since 2003
which are still in progress. However, an asset cannot be recognised for the tax credits until all the stages in the
procedure have been completed. Based on the information available as of 31 December 2018, GPA estimates that
these tax credits represent a potential asset of BRL 1,400 million (€315 million) for its Retail business.

In the case of Via Varejo, which is classified as a discontinued operation, the estimated potential tax asset amounts
to around BRL 1,106 million (roughly €249 million), including an additional amount of BRL 453 million (€102 million)
that will be owed exclusively to GPA.

#### Note 14 Related-party transactions

Related parties are:

- parent companies (mainly Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris);

- entities that exercise joint control or significant influence over the Company;

its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice and
assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris
(provision of staff and premises). The expenses recorded during the year in respect of these agreements with Casino
and its subsidiaries totalled €3.7 million, of which €3.1 million for strategic advisory services and €0.6 million for the
provision of staff and premises.

In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities, Casino and
its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys (Note 3.3.6).

#### Note 15 Subsequent events

  - **Signing of purchase pledges for the sale of six Géant hypermarkets**

On 19 January 2019, Casino Group announced that it had signed agreements to sell six hypermarkets in France to
members of the E. Leclerc Group for a combined consideration of €101 million.
The hypermarket disposals do not form part of the non-strategic asset disposal plan announced on 11 June 2018
(Note 2); they result from the Group’s stated intention to dispose of a certain number of structurally loss-making
stores. The disposals are expected to close in the first half of 2019.

  - **Sale of hypermarket and supermarket properties**

On 21 January 2019, the Group announced that it had signed an agreement with investment fund Fortress
Investment Group for the sale of 26 store properties (13 Géant Casino hypermarkets, 3 Casino hypermarkets and 10
Casino supermarkets) based on a total valuation of €501 million.
The transaction was completed on 8 March 2019 and the Group received payment of 80% of the value of the assets,
i.e., €392 million, net of transfer costs. The Group will now be associated with the value creation of the operation, via
an interest held in the new entity created by the buyer to enhance the value of the portfolio and sell the portfolio on
the market under the best possible conditions. As such, depending on the entity’s performance, the Casino Group
could receive up to an additional €150 million in the next few years.
The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing annual rent of €32 million.

  - **Agreement for the sale of R2C**

On 14 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of an agreement with Compass Group providing for the sale

employee representative bodies and the approval of the French Competition Authority.

  - **Signing of purchase pledges for the sale of loss-making stores**

On 15 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of agreements to sell a selection of structurally loss-making
stores, both integrated stores and master franchisees’ stores, for a total of €42 million.
In the case of the integrated stores, these commitments represent a value of €25 million in sale proceeds and relate
to the following:
- 17 stores (8 Leader Price, 8 Casino supermarkets and 1 Hyper Casino) to be sold to Lidl, and
- the sale of the Géant hypermarket in Roubaix (59) to a Leclerc member with a simultaneous sale of its real estate
to the owner of the shopping mall.
These 18 stores represented net sales of €88 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €12 million.
At the same time, master franchisees of the Group, with which the Casino group has a 49% stake, have signed an
agreement to sell 16 stores (9 Leader Price and 7 Casino supermarkets) to Lidl for a total of €17 million.
These 16 stores represented net sales of €60 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €9 million.
The disposals are expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, subject to prior consultation with the employee
representative bodies and the fulfilment of the usual conditions precedent.

  - **Block sale of Via Varejo shares under a total return swap (TRS) contract**

Pursuant to the authorisation given by its Board of Directors on 20 February 2019, GPA has sold to a leading
financial institution under a total return swap contract 40 million Via Varejo shares, representing 3.09% of the capital,
for BRL 200 million (€45 million). The transaction will have the effect of reducing GPA’s interest in Via Varejo to
36.27%.

  - **Signature of purchase pledges to sell two Géant hypermarkets**

On 28 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of unilateral purchase agreements with a view to the sale of
two Géant hypermarkets located in the towns of Nevers and Montauban to Groupement Les Mousquetaires for a total
value of €23.4 million covering the real estate and business assets.
These stores represented net sales of €36 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €3.5 million.
The disposals are expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, subject to prior consultation with the employee
representative bodies with whom a meeting was held on 27 February, and the fulfilment of the usual conditions
precedent.

(i) As at 31 December 2018, the Group held 25.27% of the voting rights and 39.22% of the shares, including 13.95% classified as held for sale in
accordance with IFRS 5 (Note 3.1.4).
(ii) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the GPA sub-group. As regards Via Varejo, GPA held 39.37% of the voting
rights and 43.23% of the shares, including 3.86% through a total return swap (TRS) at 31 December 2018 (Note 2). On 20 February 2019, the
holding increased to 36.27% following the signature of a second total return swap (Note 15).
(iii) FIC and BINV finance purchases made by GPA's customers. These entities were created through a partnership between Banco Itaú Unibanco
S.A ("Itaú Unibanco"), GPA, and Via Varejo. They are accounted for by the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over their
operating and financial policies. Via Varejo's 14.24% share of FIC's net assets has been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
BINV is a Via Varejo joint venture and has been classified in full as held for sale.
(iv) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the Via Varejo sub-group.
(v) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the Éxito sub-group. On 27 April 2015, Éxito signed a contractual agreement,
initially with a two-year term, granting it more than 75% of the Disco voting rights and exclusive control over the sub-group's strategic decisions.
On 29 December 2016, the agreement was extended until 30 June 2019. It will then be rolled over automatically until 30 June 2021.
(vi) Via Varejo’s main subsidiaries and joint ventures are Cnova Comercio Electronico, BINV and Bartira. The entire sub-group has been classified
as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
(vii) The trust's governance is specified in the agreement between the parties. Éxito is the majority partner and FIC has rights with respect to certain
Viva Malls business decisions concerning such matters as acquisitions and disposals in excess of a certain amount or the method of setting
budgets and business plan targets. The agreement also states that Éxito is the sole provider of property management, administrative and
marketing services for Viva Malls and that it is paid an arm's length fee for these services. A review of the substance of FIC's rights under the

#### Note 18 Standards, amendments and interpretations published but not yet mandatory

**Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union as at the**
**reporting date but not yet mandatory**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations, adopted
by the European Union but not mandatory as at 1 January 2018.

**IFRS 16 – Leases**

IFRS 16, which replaces IAS 17 and the related interpretations as from 1 January 2019, removes the distinction
between operating and finance leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a
financial liability representative of discounted future rentals for virtually all lease contracts. Operating lease expense is
replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the financial liability. Up to now, the Group
has classified most of its leases as operating leases and recognised rental expense on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. No asset or liability is recognised except to reflect any timing difference between the rental payment
period and the period in which the related expense is recognised. Consequently, adoption of IFRS 16 will have a
positive impact on performance indicators such as EBITDA and, to a lesser extent, trading profit, and a negative
impact on finance costs. Consolidated net profit may also be reduced because total rental expense is generally
higher at the beginning of the lease and decreases over time, unlike the straight-line charge recognised under the
current standard. Additionally, net cash from operating activities will be higher as cash outflows corresponding to
repayment of the principal amount of the financial liability and to interest payments will be classified as cash flows
from financing activities.

The Group mostly has property leases; annual rent on the roughly 6,400 property leases amounted to €840 million in
2018, out of total rental expense for the year of €987 million. The adoption of IFRS 16 will affect primarily the
accounting for the operating leases on the Group’s stores and warehouses, operated for the most part by the Retail
business.

In 2018, the Group continued to identify and analyse the data required for the application of IFRS 16 as at
1 January 2019. During the year, the Group started to deploy an IT application to manage leases from an operational
and financial standpoint on a fully integrated basis. The deployment process will be completed during the first half of
2019.

The Group has decided to apply the full retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019, by
restating the comparative information for 2018.
The Group has chosen to apply the recognition exemptions in IFRS 16 concerning:
   - short-term leases, and
   - leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.

Lease payments not included in the initial measurement of the financial liability (for example, variable lease
payments) will be recorded in operating expense, together with payments for short-term leases and leases for which
the underlying asset is of low value.

The lease term will correspond to the non-cancellable period, together with the period covered by any option to
extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and the period covered by any option to
terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The Group will apply the position of
the French accounting standards authority (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) concerning the lease term to be
applied to commercial leases in France.
The discount rate used to calculate the value of the right-of-use asset and the financial liability will be determined on
a country-by-country basis.

At this stage, the estimated effect of applying IFRS 16 has been determined based on property leases, which account
for substantially all of the impact. It does not include the effect on equipment leases, which is in the process of being
estimated.

The estimated effect on the opening statement of financial position at 1 January 2018 would be as follows (excluding
equipment leases):
   - An increase in assets (mainly arising from the recognition of right-of-use assets) of between €3.7 billion and
€4.2 billion.
   - An increase in liabilities (arising from the recognition of a financial liability) of between €4.0 billion and
€4.5 billion.
   - A reduction in equity, before tax, of between €0.2 billion and €0.4 billion.


-----

This impact can be broken down by segment as follows:

**(€ billions)** **France Retail** **Latam Retail** **E-commerce** **Group total**

**Right-of-use** 2.4 to 2.8 1.2 to 1.5 0.1 to 0.2 3.7 to 4.2

**Lease liabilities** 2.5 to 2.9 1.4 to 1.6 0.1 to 0.2 4.0 to 4.5

**Equity, before tax** 0.1 to 0.2 0.2 to 0.3 n.m. 0.2 to 0.4

The impact on profit attributable to owners of the parent will not be material.

The Group has chosen to present right-of-use assets and the related financial liabilities on separate lines of the
consolidated statement of financial position. “Net debt” as defined by the Group (see Note 11) will not be impacted by
the application of IFRS 16.

The actual effect of applying IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 may be different from the above estimates for the
following reasons:
   - the Group has not yet completed its tests and assessments of controls over the new lease accounting
system, and
   - the Group may change the chosen methods of applying new accounting standards in the period up to the
date when its first financial statements presented in accordance with IFRS 16 are published (i.e., the 2019
interim financial statements).

As at 31 December 2018, off-balance sheet non-cancellable operating lease commitments (property leases and
equipment leases) amounted to €3,252 million based on IAS 17 (Note 7.2). The difference between this off-balance
sheet commitment and the estimated financial liability for property leases under IFRS 16 can be explained primarily
as follows:
   - The financial liability is greater because the estimate is based on the period during with the Group is
reasonably certain of using the asset, which is longer than the non-cancellable period.
   - The effect of this is offset by the effect of discounting the future lease payments, unlike under IAS 17.

In the absence of any generally accepted position concerning the application of impairment tests, the Group has not
performed new impairment tests taking into account the effects of applying IFRS 16.

The accounting treatment of leases by the lessor is similar to that under IAS 17; leases continue to be classified as
finance leases or operating leases as applicable. Based on the above, the Group does not expect the application of
IFRS 16 to have a material impact on the financial statements, with regards to leases where the Group is lessor.
However, certain additional disclosures will be made as from 2019.

**IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments**

This interpretation is applicable as at 1 January 2019, using the full or partial retrospective approach.
IFRIC 23 explains how to reflect the effects of uncertainty in accounting for current and deferred tax assets and
liabilities under IAS 12 – Income taxes. It clarifies the following main points:

- Judgement should be used to determine whether uncertain tax treatments should be considered separately or
together.

- An entity should assume that the taxation authority will examine all amounts reported to it and will have full
knowledge of all relevant information when doing so.

- The decision whether to recognise current and deferred tax assets and liabilities should be made based on the
probability (i.e., is it more probable than not) that the asset will be recovered or the liability will be paid.

- If it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the provision should be
based on the estimated amount that the entity expects to pay or recover, as determined by (i) the most likely
amount method or (ii) a method based on the weighted average of the various possible scenarios.

**Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment features with negative compensation**

These amendments are applicable as at 1 January 2019 on a retrospective basis.
The amendments expand the classification of financial assets at amortised cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income and clarify the application of the "solely a payment of principal and interest" test to certain
debt instruments with a prepayment feature where the effect of exercising this clause would reasonably lead to
repayments that are lower than the amount of principal and interest due.

**Standards and interpretations not adopted by the European Union as at the reporting**
**date**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations applicable to the
Group which have not yet been adopted by the European Union:

**Standard** **Description of the standard**

**(application date for the Group subject to**
**adoption by the EU)**

Amendments to IAS 28 These amendments will be applicable on a retrospective basis.

These amendments clarify that IFRS 9 (including the impairment

_Long-term interests in associates and joint_

rules) applies to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture

_ventures_

that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture
(1 January 2019) but to which the equity method is not applied.

IFRS Annual Improvements Cycles The main standards concerned are:
2015-2017 cycle - IAS 12 – _Income Taxes: these amendments clarify that the tax_
consequences of dividend payments (i.e., distributions of profits)

(1 January 2019) should be recognised in profit or loss, equity or other

comprehensive income according to where the transactions that
generated the distributed profits were presented. They will be
applicable on a retrospective basis as from the first comparative
period presented.

                     - IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs: These amendments clarify that if any
specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is
ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of
the funds that an entity borrows generally. These amendments
will be applicable on a prospective basis.


Amendments to IAS 19
_Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement_

(1 January 2019)

Amendments to IFRS 3
_Definition of a business_

(1 January 2020)

Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8
_Definition of materiality_

(1 January 2020)


These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis to plan
amendments, curtailments and settlements of defined benefit plans.
They require an entity to use updated assumptions to determine
current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period
after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement.

These amendments, which will be applicable on a prospective basis,
clarify the definition of a business and the application guidance for the
assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a
group of assets rather than a business.
Under the amended definition, to be considered a business, the
integrated set of activities and assets must create output in the form of
goods and services delivered to customers, rather than being
conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to
investors or other owners, members or participants.
In addition, an optional concentration test has been introduced to
simplify the assessment of whether an integrated set of activities and
assets is a group of assets and not a business.

These amendments, which will be applicable on a prospective basis,
amend and expand the definition of materiality in IAS 1 and IAS 8.
They also align the definition of materiality with the wording of the
_IFRS Conceptual Framework._


These interpretations and amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the Group's consolidated
financial statements.

To the Shareholders’ Meeting of CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON,

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders’ Meeting, we have
audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon
for the year ended December 31, 2018.

F 152


-----

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets
and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2018 and of the
results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.

**Basis for opinion**

**Audit framework**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Statutory Auditors’
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our report.

**Independence**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us,
for the period from January 1, 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not
provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No.

_profession de commissaire aux comptes)._

**Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we
inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our
professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide a separate
opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.

|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes “10.1 – Goodwill”, “10.2 – Other intangible assets” and “10.5 – Impairment of non-current assets” to the consolidated financial statements||
|As of December 31, 2018, the net carrying amounts of goodwill and brands with an indefinite life recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position amount to, respectively, €8,690 million and €1,515 million, which represents approximately 27% of total consolidated assets. As part of the valuation of these assets, the Group allocates goodwill and brands to cash- generating units (CGUs) using the method described in Notes 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The Group performs impairment tests at least once a year and whenever a trigger for impairment is identified. We considered the valuation of goodwill and brands, including the goodwill relating to Franprix - Leader Price and the brand relating to Extra, to be a key audit matter due to the following: - their materiality in the consolidated financial statements; - the importance of management’s estimates, assessments and significant assumptions on the basis of which their recoverable amount is determined, based on the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from these assets; - the sensitivity of the valuation of these recoverable amounts to certain assumptions.|We examined the compliance of the methodology implemented by management with the accounting standards in force. We also assessed the main estimates used and analyzed in particular: - the consistency of cash flow projections with the budget and the medium-term business plan prepared by management, as well as the consistency of these projections with the Group’s historical performance and the economic context in which the Group operates; - the methods and parameters used to determine the discount rates applied to estimated cash flows. With the assistance of our valuation experts, we recalculated these discount rates using the most recent market data available, compared the results obtained with (i) the rates adopted by management and (ii) the rates observed for several players operating in the same business sector as the Group, and assessed the reasonableness of the rates adopted by management; - the relevance of the sensitivity scenarios used by management. Finally, we examined the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, especially those relating to sensitivity tests.|

|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes “6.2 – Cost of goods sold” and “6.8 – Other current assets” to the consolidated financial statements||
|Within the scope of its retail activities, the Group receives rebates from its suppliers in the form of discounts and commercial cooperation fees. These benefits, generally paid on the basis of a percentage defined contractually, and applied on purchases made from suppliers, are recorded as a deduction from cost of goods sold. Considering the material impact of these accounting entries on net profit for the year, the large number of contracts involved and the necessity for management to estimate the related purchases for each supplier, we considered the valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit, we :  examined the internal control measures relating to the process for monitoring these rebates in the Group’s various significant subsidiaries and carried out tests on the key controls;  reconciled, on a sampling basis, the contractual terms relating to rebates to be received from suppliers with their valuation;  examined the estimates used by management to determine these year- end rebates, in particular the valuation of the level of purchases at year-end used to determine the amounts of the invoices to be issued;  followed up on the collection of these receivables subsequent to the year- end date.|

|Recognition of tax credits and follow up on the contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2|
|---|---|
|Risk identified|Our response|
|These tax credits are recognized based on: (i) the interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence, in particular in the retail sector in Brazil, (ii) legal opinions provided by the subsidiary’s external tax advisors, when it is considered that they can be estimated and that their recoverability is probable. Furthermore, as described in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group estimated to €315 million the amount of contingent PIS and COFINS tax credit assets in relation to the exclusion of ICMS from the calculation basis of these two taxes. GPA is also involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in Brazil arising, notably, from tax claims filed by the Brazilian tax authorities. These tax risks that are estimated at €2,128 million as of December 31, 2018 were analysed as contingent liabilities and no provisions were recognized as of December 31, 2018, as indicated in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements.|Concerning tax credits, we examined: - the internal control environment and process in which these tax credits are monitored and we tested the related key controls using sampling techniques; - the documentation that evidences either the recognition of ICMS tax credits over the year, or the qualification of the PIS and COFINS tax credits as a contingent tax asset; - the legal or technical opinions provided by law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the recognition of the tax credits shown in the consolidated financial statements; - the assumptions used by management to draw up the recovery plan underlying the recognized ICMS tax credits. Concerning contingent liabilities, we: - reconciled the list of identified disputes with the information provided by GPA’s main law firms that we contacted; - examined the information on the legal or technical proceedings and/or opinions provided by the law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the qualification of the various disputes as contingent liabilities; - examined the risk estimates prepared by the Group and reconciled them with the figures in relation to the contingent tax liabilities that are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.|

|---|---|
|Risk identified|Our response|
|We considered the recognition and recoverability of both the tax credits and the valuation and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities to be key audit matters for the following reasons: (i) the significance in the accounts of the tax credit balance, the contingent asset relating to PIS and COFINS tax credits and the amount of contingent tax liabilities as of December 31, 2018, (ii) the complexity of the Brazilian tax legislation related to taxes and (iii) the use of judgements and estimates by management in connection with the recognition of tax credits and the valuation of the contingent tax liabilities.|Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.|

|---|---|
|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes “2 – Significant events of the year” and “3.5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements||
|Via Varejo constitutes the entire “Latam Electronics” operating sector and the e- commerce business in Brazil through its subsidiary Cnova Brazil (hereinafter “Via Varejo”). As of December 31, 2018, the Via Varejo assets and liabilities held for sale are shown on a separate line and total respectively €5,698 million and €4,426 million, hence net assets amounting to €1,272 million (about 11% of the consolidated net assets). As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the disposal of the Group’s investment in Via Varejo initiated in 2016 could not be finalized as of December 31, 2018. However, while seeking to continue with such disposal to strategic investors, the subsidiary’s Board of Directors authorized alternatives to conclude this disposal by December 31, 2019.|Within the scope of our audit: - we analyzed the documentation underlying the ongoing disposal of Via Varejo which led the Group’s management to maintain Via Varejo in assets held for sale and discontinued operations, particularly (i) the minutes of the GPA Board of Directors’ meeting which authorized the alternatives to conclude the sale by December 31, 2019, including the possibility of selling its investment via stock market transactions and (ii) the terms of sale of a portion of the ordinary shares of Via Varejo in December 2018, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements;|

|---|---|
|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes “2 – Significant events of the year” and “3.5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements||
|As the Group therefore estimated the disposal of Via Varejo to be highly probable in 2019, Via Varejo’s activities were maintained in discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5: - the assets and liabilities as well as the cash flow of Via Varejo were presented on a separate lines respectively of the consolidated statement of financial position and of the consolidated statement of cash flows; - the after tax net profit of the Via Varejo activities was presented in a separate line of the consolidated statement of income (“Net profit from discontinued operations”); - Via Varejo was valued at the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less selling costs. Given the significance of Via Varejo’s contribution to the consolidated financial statements and the degree of judgement in relation to (i) the highly probable nature of the disposal that justifies to maintain the recording of the Via Varejo’s business in the discontinued operations and (ii) the valuation of the investment, we believe the presentation and valuation of the discontinued operations of Via Varejo to be a key audit matter|- we examined the presentation of all of the items comprising the assets and liabilities, the cash flow statement and the after tax net profit of the Via Varejo activities in “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities associated with assets held for sale” (Note 3.5.1), as well as in profit and cash flow from discontinued operations (Notes 3.5.2 and 3.5.3), with regard to IFRS 5. - we assessed the methods for determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities, less estimated selling costs, as of December 31, 2018. In particular, we considered whether the estimate of the fair value of Via Varejo was consistent with the disposal arrangements planned by management. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.|

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is
expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the
effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its
internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

**Objective and audit approach**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does
not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the
affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France,
the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgement throughout the audit and
furthermore:

- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control;

- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated
financial statements;

- assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in
the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;

- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses
whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner
that achieves fair presentation;

- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated

financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion
expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

**Report to the Audit Committee**

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the
scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit.
We also bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the
accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are
required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6 of
Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules
applicable in France as defined in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French
Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where
appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought
to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

(i) The €1,259 million negative net translation adjustment in 2017 arose primarily from the depreciation of the Brazilian and
Colombian currencies (€1,116 million and €89 million, respectively). The €1,603 million positive net translation adjustment in
2016 primarily reflected the appreciation of the Brazilian currency for €1,719 million.
(ii) The €47 million positive change in 2016 corresponded to the reclassification to the income statement of the hedge of net
investments in Asian operations, following their disposal.

Changes in other comprehensive income are presented in Note 12.6.2.

### NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON GROUP

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon (“the Company”) is a French société anonyme listed in compartment A of Euronext
Paris. The Company and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as "the Group" or "the Casino Group". The
Company's registered office is at 1, Cours Antoine Guichard, 42008 Saint-Etienne, France.

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 reflect the accounting situation of
the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures.

The 2017 consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon were approved for publication by
the Board of Directors on 7 March 2018.

#### Note 1 Significant accounting policies

###### 1.1 Accounting standards 

Pursuant to European Commission regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, the consolidated financial statements
of the Casino Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the European Union as of the
date of approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors and applicable at 31 December 2017.

These standards are available on the European Commission's website: https://ec.europa.eu/info/businesseconomy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting_en

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in all periods presented, after taking
account of the new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations listed below.

These amendments to existing standards and interpretations had no material impact on the Group's financial
performance or position.

**Standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted by the European Union**
**and mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017**

The European Union has adopted the following standards, amendments to existing standards and
interpretations that are applicable in the case of the Group as from the financial year beginning on
1 January 2017. These new standards, amendments and interpretations are applicable retrospectively by the
Group unless otherwise indicated. They do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

- Amendments to IAS 12 – Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
The amendments clarify certain principles applicable to the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised
losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. They are designed to address the diversity in practice around
this issue.

- Amendments to IAS 7 - Disclosure Initiative: financing activities
These amendments are applicable on a prospective basis. They require entities to provide additional disclosures
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities,
including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
To fulfil this obligation, entities are required to provide disclosures on the following changes in liabilities arising
from financing activities:
(a) changes arising from cash flows from financing activities;
(b) changes arising from the acquisition or loss of control of subsidiaries;
(c) effects of changes in exchange rates;
(d) fair value adjustments; and
(e) other changes.


-----

###### 1.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements 

**1.2.1 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, with the
exception of the following:

- assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, which are measured at fair value in accordance
with IFRS 3;

- derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets, which are measured at fair value.
The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities hedged by a fair value hedge which would otherwise be
measured at cost are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros. The figures in the tables have been
rounded to the nearest million euros and include individually rounded data. Consequently, the totals and
sub-totals shown may not correspond exactly to the sum of the reported amounts.

**1.2.2 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses, as well
as the disclosures made in certain notes to the consolidated financial statements. Due to the inherent uncertainty
of assumptions, actual results may differ from the estimates. Estimates and assessments are reviewed at regular
intervals and adjusted where necessary to take into account past experience and any relevant economic factors.

The main judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the information available when the financial
statements are drawn up and concern the following:

  - classification and measurement of Via Varejo's net assets, and other France Retail segment assets in
accordance with IFRS 5 (Note 3.5);

  - valuation of non-current assets and goodwill (Note 10.5);

  - recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets (Note 9);

   - provisions for risks (Note 13) – particularly tax and employee-related risks – and recognition, presentation
and measurement of the recoverable amount of tax credits (VAT or similar, notably ICMS and PIS and
COFINS) (Notes 5.1, 6.9 and 13).


-----

#### Note 2 Significant events of the year

Significant events of the year included:

    - **Planned disposal of Via Varejo**

On 23 November 2016, the Group announced that it had approved GPA’s decision to start negotiations for
the sale of its investment in its subsidiary Via Varejo, in line with its long-term strategic refocusing on the food
retailing business.
In 2017, due to certain external factors that were beyond GPA’s control, related mainly to the macro-economic
environment in Brazil, it was not possible to adhere to the original timeline for the Via Varejo sale. The sale
process is nevertheless continuing and GPA, assisted by its financial advisors, has updated the next stages
in the plan which should lead to Via Varejo being sold in 2018.
Consequently, in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations:

 - the assets and liabilities held for sale have been reported on a separate line (Note 3.5.1);

 - Via Varejo's net profit and cash flows for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 are reported on
separate lines in the income statement and statement of cash flows;

 - Via Varejo has been excluded from tables in notes, in particular relative to lease commitments (Note 7.2)
and GPA’s contingent liabilities (Note 13.3). If necessary, specific information for Via Varejo is provided in
a footnote.

    - **Final results of the Group's public tender offer for Cnova N.V. shares**

On 31 January 2017, the Group announced the final results of the tender offer for ordinary Cnova N.V. shares
launched on 6 December 2016. A total of 31.7 million shares were tendered to the offer and a further
0.3 million shares were purchased in March 2017.

Together, these purchases concerned 9.3% of Cnova's share capital and led to:

 - the derecognition of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests that had been recognised in
liabilities at 31 December 2016 for €187 million, a cash payment of €171 million (Note 4.7), and the
recognition in equity attributable to owners of the parent of an amount of €22 million;

 - the transfer of a negative €6 million from non-controlling interests to equity attributable to the owners of the
parent, reflecting the Group's increased stake in Cnova N.V.

At 31 December 2017, the Group holds 98.97 % of the capital of Cnova N.V. and 99.46 % of the voting rights.
Taking into account the interest held by GPA in Cnova N.V., the Group’s percentage interest stands at 76.11%.

On 21 February 2017, Cnova N.V. made a formal application to delist its ordinary shares from Nasdaq. The
decision was rendered effective on 3 March 2017. Since that date, US public reporting obligations under the
Exchange Act have been suspended. Cnova N.V.’s ordinary shares continue to be listed on Euronext Paris.

    - **Proceedings brought by the DGCCRF (French competition authority) against AMC and INCAA**
**and inquiries**

On 28 February 2017, the French Ministry of the Economy, represented by the Department of Competition
Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), brought an action against Casino in the Paris
Commercial Court. The case involves a series of credit notes totalling €22 million issued in 2013 and 2014 by
41 suppliers. The DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned together with a fine
of €2 million. The proceedings are in progress. Casino reaffirms its position that these credit notes are perfectly
legitimate and intends to challenge the grounds for this action.
Also, on 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and their respective parent companies
Intermarché and Casino, were similarly prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices
that took place in 2015 against 13 multinational companies of the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a civil
fine of €2 million.
The Group considers that it complied with the applicable regulations during negotiations with the suppliers
concerned by both sets of proceedings and has therefore chosen not to set aside a provision in the early
stages of challenging the proceedings (Note 13.3).

Moreover, the Group is undergoing two inquiries by the French and European competition authorities.

In early February 2017, France’s Competition Authority launched an investigation into the practices of
Vindémia Logistique and Vindémia Group in the areas of consumer goods supply and distribution on Reunion
Island. At this stage, the Competition Authority has not issued any complaint and it is not currently possible to
predict the probable outcome of the investigation.


-----

Also, at the end of February 2017, the European Commission launched an investigation into contracts for the
purchase of basic consumer goods, the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and the sale to
consumers of basic consumer goods. The companies targeted by the investigation included Achats
Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino Achats (INCAA). The
European Commission has not issued any complaints and it is not currently possible to predict the probable
outcome of the investigation.

   - **Bond exchange**

On 30 May 2017, the Group issued €550 million worth of five-year 1.865% bonds (Note 11.2.2).
At the same time, €153 million, €153 million and €60 million worth of bonds maturing respectively in
November 2018 (5.73% coupon), August 2019 (4.41% coupon) and March 2020 (5.24% coupon) were
bought back, reducing the issues’ respective nominal amounts to €355 million, €697 million and €540 million.
Taking into account the difference between the buyback price and the bonds’ face value, the cash outflow
for this transaction totalled €400 million. Settlement and delivery took place on 13 June 2017.

This transaction was accounted for as an extension of financial liabilities given the non-material nature of
the changes to the contractual terms. The €400 million impact of the bond exchange thus constitutes an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the 2022 bonds and is being amortised by the yield-to-maturity method
over the remaining term of the modified liability. This accounting treatment also applies to the bond
premiums, unamortised issue expenses and hedging effects related to the exchanged bonds, and all
exchange-related fees.

   - **Refinancing of a credit facility**

On 26 July 2017, Casino announced that it had obtained a confirmed five-year credit facility for
USD 750 million (around €645 million) from a group of 11 international banks (Note 11.2.4). The line of credit
was used to refinance an existing USD 1 billion facility, extending the average maturity of the Group’s
confirmed lines of credit from 2.4 years to 3.4 years as of the transaction date.
Casino also has two one-year rollover options, subject to the banks’ approval.

   - **Interim dividend**

On 11 December 2017, the Company paid an interim dividend of €173 million (Note 12.8).

   - **Partnership with Ocado Group**

On 28 November 2017, the Casino Group and Ocado Group plc (“Ocado”), the world’s leading dedicated
on-line grocery retailer, signed an agreement to develop the Ocado Smart Platform in France. The platform
will comprise a purpose-built automated warehouse and an integrated software solution and website.
The agreement sets out plans for the launch, within two years, of a warehouse in the Greater Paris area
using Ocado’s proprietary equipment. In consideration of the investments made by Ocado, the Casino Group
will pay Ocado certain upfront fees upon signing and during the development phase, then ongoing fees
linked to its utilisation of capacity and service criteria.
In addition to the initial platform, Casino and Ocado will consider further development of other platforms
close to other large urban areas.

   - **Casino Group rating by Moody’s**

In line with the policy of rotating rating agencies, as recommended by the European regulator, Moody’s
Investors Service has been appointed as the Group’s new rating agency, replacing Fitch Ratings
(Note 11.5.4).

   - **Creation of CD Supply Innovation**

On 4 December 2017, Casino and Dia announced that they were extending their cooperation on private
labels that began in 2015, by creating a new joint subsidiary named CD Supply Innovation. The new
company, which began operations on 15 December 2017, manages the ordering, payment and supply of
private label products for both groups.
Casino’s investment in CD Supply Innovation did not have a material impact on the consolidated statement
of financial position and income statement in 2017.

#### Note 3 Scope of consolidation


**Accounting principles**

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all material subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates over which the parent company exercises control, joint control or significant
influence, either directly or indirectly (see list of consolidated companies in Note 17).

SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group (i) has power over
the entity, (ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and (iii)
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date
when control is acquired to the date at which the Group no longer exercises control. All controlled
companies are fully consolidated in the Group's statement of financial position, regardless of the
percentage interest held.

POTENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS
Control is assessed by taking potential voting rights into account, but only if they are substantive; that
is, if the entity has the practical ability to exercise its rights with respect to the exercise price, date and
terms.
The Group may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible
into ordinary shares or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to
give the Group voting power or reduce another party's voting power over the financial and operational
policies of an entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group has control of another entity. Potential
voting rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised
or converted until a future date or until the occurrence of a future event.

JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that exercise joint control over an entity have
rights to its net assets. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control over an entity,
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the
parties sharing control.
Joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method.

ASSOCIATES
Associates are companies in which the Group exercises significant influence over financial and
operational policies without having control. They are accounted for in the consolidated financial
statements using the equity method.

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING
The equity method provides that an investment in an associate or a joint venture be recognised initially
at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted by the Group's share in profit or loss and, where
appropriate, in other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Goodwill related to these
entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any impairment losses and gains or losses
on disposal of investments in equity-accounted entities are recognised in "Other operating income and
expenses".
Profits/losses from internal acquisitions or disposals with equity-accounted associates are eliminated
to the extent of the Group's percentage interest in these companies. In the absence of any guidance
in IFRS concerning cases where the amount to be eliminated is greater than the carrying amount of
the investment in the equity-accounted company, the Group has elected to cap the amount eliminated
from the accounts in the transaction year and to deduct the uneliminated portion from its share of the
equity-accounted company's profits in subsequent years. The Group follows a transparent approach
to accounting for associates under the equity method and takes into account, if relevant, its final
percentage interest in the associate for the purpose of determining the proportion of profit (loss) to be
eliminated.
In the absence of any standard or interpretation covering dilution of the Group's interest in a subsidiary
of an equity-accounted company, the dilution impact is recognised in the Group's share of the profit
(loss) of the equity-accounted investee.


-----

Business combinations

As required by IFRS 3 revised, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) in a business
combination is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities
incurred on the date of the transaction. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
measured at their acquisition-date fair values.

Acquisition-related costs are recognised in "Other operating expenses", except for those related to the
issue of equity instruments.
Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each business
combination, the Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case, the amount
of goodwill is limited to the portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method. Under the full
goodwill method, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value and goodwill is recognised on the
full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial goodwill
method, which was the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3.

In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is
remeasured at fair value as at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and
carrying amount of the previously-held interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under "Other
operating income" or "Other operating expenses").
The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the
information needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new
information obtained by the buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted after the measurement period (not exceeding 12 months
from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent acquisitions of non-controlling interests do not
give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill.

Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair value,
whatever the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent
consideration due to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded by
adjusting goodwill if they occur during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss for the period
under "Other operating income" or "Other operating expenses" if they arise after the measurement
period, unless the obligation is settled in equity instruments. In that case, the contingent consideration
is not remeasured subsequently.

Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies

In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of shares
in consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the following
principle:

 - the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is

eliminated in full from the accounts of the acquirer;

 - non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a

corresponding adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total equity.

Foreign currency translation

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the
Group's parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their
financial transactions are measured in that currency.

The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent
company are translated using the closing rate method, as follows:

- assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated into euros at the
closing rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date;

- income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the period
unless significant variances occur.

The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on translation
of the net investment in the operation concerned at successive reporting dates are reclassified to profit
or loss. Because the Group applies the step-by-step method of consolidation, the cumulative translation
differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if the foreign operation disposed is part of a sub-group.
This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the sub-group.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rate on the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and
the resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement under "Foreign currency
exchange gains" or "Foreign currency exchange losses" Non-monetary assets and liabilities


-----

denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction
date.

Exchange differences arising on translation of the net investment in a foreign operation are recognised
in the consolidated financial statements as a separate component of equity and reclassified to profit or
loss on disposal of the net investment.

Exchange differences arising on translation of (i) foreign currency borrowings hedging a net investment
denominated in a foreign currency or (ii) permanent advances made to subsidiaries are also recognised
in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.


###### 3.1 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2017

**3.1.1 Loss of control of a group of Casino supermarkets**

In line with its ongoing franchising development plans, in February 2017, Distribution Casino France sold to a
master franchisee a 51% stake in two sub-groups representing a total of 21 Casino supermarkets that were
loss-making under the integrated management system. The net loss on the sale amounted to €30 million and
was recorded in "Other operating expenses" (Note 6.5).

If the transaction had been completed on 1 January 2017, the impact on net sales for the year, trading profit,
other operating income and expenses and the Group's share of profit of equity-accounted investees would have
been non-material.

Distribution Casino France has two call options on these two groups of stores, which are exercisable between
November 2018 and October 2020 (Note 3.4.2).

**3.1.2 Changes in scope relating to the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group**

On 10 February 2017 and 8 March 2017, Franprix-Leader Price acquired an additional 40% stake in the Sarjel
group, which was previously 60%-owned. The amount disbursed for this acquisition was €19 million including
transaction costs (Note 4.7). The operation was accounted for as a transaction between owners, leading to a
€4 million reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent, and a €14 million reduction in liabilities for put
options granted to owners of non-controlling interests.

In addition, as part of the ongoing strategy to transform the store base and improve its profitability,
Franprix-Leader Price began the process of selling a group of 105 Franprix and Leader Price stores to a master
franchisee. At 31 December 2017, the assets and liabilities of these 105 stores – representing net assets of €33
million – were reclassified as “Assets held for sale” for €67 million and “Liabilities associated with assets held
for sale” for €34 million, as required by IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
No material impairment losses were recognised on reclassification of the stores in accordance with IFRS 5.
A further 17 Franprix and Leader Price stores will be transferred to the master franchisee under business leases.
The sale was completed on February 28, 2018 once Competition Authority approval had been obtained.
Meanwhile management of the stores was performed by the master franchisee since 13 October 2017.
Franprix-Leader Price has retained a 49% interest in the group of stores and has a call option exercisable at the
end of 2021.

Lastly, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of various stores during 2017, at a total cost of €43 million
(including €23 million disbursed during the year). Provisional goodwill on these transactions amounted to
€32 million. One of the acquired sub-groups was previously accounted for by the equity method in the Casino
Group's consolidated financial statements. The previously-held interest was therefore remeasured at its
acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €9 million gain in “Other operating income”.
The contribution of these stores to consolidated net sales was €2 million. Their contribution to profit before tax
for the year was a negative €3 million before taking into account the gain recognised on remeasurement of the
previously-held interest.
If these acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2017, the additional contribution to consolidated net
sales and net profit before tax would have been €17 and €2 million respectively (before taking into account the
gain recognised on remeasurement of the previously-held interest).


-----

###### 3.2 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2016

**3.2.1 Disposal of operations in Asia**

    - **Disposal of operations in Thailand**
On 14 January 2016, the Group announced its intention to sell its stake in its subsidiary Big C Supercenter PCL
("Big C"), a company listed in Thailand. Big C was sold on 21 March 2016 to BJC, a TCC group subsidiary. The
proceeds from the sale amounted to €3,066 million net of disposal costs, generating an after-tax gain of €2,314
million (Note 3.5.2).
As part of the transaction, Cnova sold its economic interests in Cdiscount Thailand to the BJC group for
€28 million net of disposal costs (including repayment of a €6 million loan), realising an after-tax gain of
€27 million (Note 3.5.2).

    - **Disposal of operations in Vietnam**
On 29 April 2016, the Group announced that it had sold Big C Vietnam to the Central group for an enterprise
value of €1 billion. As the decision to dispose of operations in Vietnam was made before the end of 2015, the
assets and liabilities of the E-commerce and Retail businesses in Vietnam were classified as held for sale at 31
December 2015. The proceeds amounted to €875 million net of disposal costs, generating an after-tax gain of
€524 million (Note 3.5.2).

Following the disposal of its operations in Thailand and Vietnam, representing the entire "Asia" operating
segment and part of the "E-commerce" operating segment, the Group presented the net after-tax profit of its
Thai and Vietnamese operations as well as the capital gain on the disposal of these businesses on a separate
line of the income statement ("Net profit from discontinued operations").

**3.2.2 Acquisition of Éxito shares**

Between 1 March and 28 March 2016, the Group acquired 2.4 million shares in its subsidiary Éxito for a total of
USD 11 million (€10 million) (Note 4.7), increasing its stake in the company to 55.30% from 54.77% previously.
These transactions had a €6 million positive impact on equity attributable to owners of the parent and a €17
million negative impact on non-controlling interests.

**3.2.3 Acquisition of GPA shares**

In June 2016, the Group acquired 970 thousand preference shares, representing approximately 0.4% of GPA's
capital, for €11 million (Note 4.7). These transactions had a €6 million positive impact on equity attributable to
owners of the parent and a €17 million negative impact on non-controlling interests.

**3.2.4 Changes in scope relating to the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group**

In line with the ongoing franchising development plans at Franprix-Leader Price, in 2016 the subsidiary sold to
two master franchisees a group of Franprix and Leader Price stores that were loss-making under the integrated
management system. The Group sold a 51% interest in the stores, generating a €61 million net loss recognised
in "Other operating expenses" (Note 6.5). If the transactions had been completed on 1 January 2016, (i) net
sales for the year would have been reduced by €33 million, (ii) trading profit would have been increased by €13
million, (iii) other operating expenses would have been increased by €9 million (comprising impairment losses
of €4.5 million and a €4.5 million remeasurement of the retained interest) and (iv) the Group’s share of profit of
equity-accounted investees would have been reduced by €6 million.
Franprix-Leader Price has various call options on the stores (Note 3.4.2).

Master franchisees also acquired a 49% interest in a group of profit-making Franprix and Leader Price stores.
These disposals without loss of control, had no material impact on equity attributable to owners of the parent.


-----

Furthermore, Franprix-Leader Price also acquired controlling interests in various groups in 2016. The amounts
disbursed for these acquisitions totalled €32 million and generated provisional goodwill of €35 million. Since
some of the sub-groups acquired were previously equity-accounted in the Casino Group's consolidated financial
statements, the remeasurement of the interests previously held generated a €3 million gain.
The sub-groups' contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from the acquisition date to the 2016 yearend amounted to €23 million. Their contribution to pre-tax profit for the period was a negative €11 million.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2016, net sales for the year would have been increased
by €16 million and pre-tax profit would have been reduced by €1 million.

**3.2.5 Loss of control of a group of Casino supermarkets**

In line with its franchising development strategy, during the second half of 2016 Distribution Casino France sold
to a master franchisee a 51% stake in a group of 12 Casino supermarkets that were loss-making under the
integrated management system. The net loss on the sale amounted to €34 million and was recorded in "Other
operating expenses" (Note 6.5). If the transaction had been completed on 1 January 2016, (i) net sales for the
year would have been reduced by €14 million, (ii) trading profit would have been increased by €9 million, (iii)
other operating expense would have been increased by €1 million and the Group's share of profit of equityaccounted investees would have been reduced by €3 million.
Distribution Casino France has a call option on the group of stores that is exercisable in 2019 (Note 3.4.2).

**3.2.6 Acquisition of control of Geimex**

The Group acquired control of Geimex in October 2016. Geimex was previously jointly controlled and was
accounted for by the equity method on a 50% basis in the Group accounts until 31 October 2016. The purchase
price amounted to €45 million and the transaction costs came to €1 million.
The change in accounting method from the equity method at 50% to full consolidation resulted in the recognition
of a €16 million gain from remeasurement of the previously-held interest, which was recognised in “Other
operating income” (Note 6.5).
Geimex's contribution to consolidated net sales and consolidated net profit for the period from 31 October to 31
December 2016 amounted to €25 million and €1 million respectively (excluding the gain from remeasurement
at fair value of the previously-held interest). If control of Geimex had been acquired on 1 January 2016, it would
have added €148 million to net sales and €1 million to consolidated net profit.
The final accounting for the business combination did not lead to any adjustment to the fair value of the assets
and liabilities as determined in 2016. Goodwill recognised on the acquisition amounted to €69 million.

**3.2.7 Creation of the Viva Malls real estate trust in Colombia**

On 15 July 2016, Éxito created a Colombian real estate trust named Viva Malls to hold all of the Viva brand
shopping centres and malls. On 22 December 2016, Éxito and Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia (FIC), a private
equity fund managed by Fiduciara Bancolombia, signed an agreement providing for the acquisition by FIC of a
49% stake in the trust's capital. FIC's total capital commitment amounts to COP 773 billion (€245 million), of
which €124 million excluding expenses was paid as of 31 December 2016, €80 million was paid in 2017 (Note
4.7) and the balance will be paid by 30 June 2018. FIC's stake in Viva Malls was valued based on the total value
attributed to the trust's real estate assets of COP 1,600 billion (€506 million). Following this transaction, Éxito
owns 51% of Viva Malls.

The operation was accounted for as a transaction between owners, leading to a €3 million reduction in equity
attributable to owners of the parent (including €6 million in costs) and a €115 million increase in non-controlling
interests (net of €5 million in costs) in 2016, and increases of €23 million and €58 million respectively in 2017.

###### 3.3 Investments in equity-accounted investees

**3.3.1 Significant associates and joint ventures**

The following table presents the condensed financial statements (on a 100% basis) for the four main investees
accounted for by the equity method. These condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS
correspond to the investees' published financial statements, as restated where appropriate for the adjustments
made by the Group, for example fair value adjustments on the date control is acquired or lost, adjustments to
bring the investee's accounting policies into line with Group policies, or adjustments to eliminate gains and
losses on intra-group acquisitions and disposals for the portion corresponding to the Group's percentage interest

**Dividends received**

(i) As at 31 December 2017, the Group held 40.24% of the capital of Mercialys. The Group considers that it exercises
significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the Mercialys Group. This position is based on (a) the
absence of a majority vote on strategic decisions at meetings of the company's Board of Directors, which is mostly made
up of independent directors, (b) the governance rules stipulating that Casino's representatives on the Mercialys Board
may not take part in decisions concerning transactions carried out with the Group, (c) business contracts entered into
between the Group and Mercialys on an arm's length basis, and (d) an analysis of the votes cast at recent General
Shareholders Meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related parties do not control shareholder decisions at
General Meetings).
(ii) The main associate of the GPA sub-group is FIC, which was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco SA
(“Itaú Unibanco”) to finance purchases by GPA's customers. Associates of the GPA sub-group are accounted for using
the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over their operating and financial policies. The data presented
above only concern FIC as the other associates are not material.
(iii) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of Tuya (interest held by the Éxito
sub-group) and FIC (interest held by GPA). GPA holds 50% of the voting rights in FIC and 41.93% of the capital (including
6.17% through Via Varejo which is classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5).
(iv) The current assets and liabilities of Banque du Groupe Casino, Tuya and FIC primarily concern their credit business.
(v) Concerning FIC, the adjustment concerns a statutory reserve over which Itaú Unibanco has exclusive rights.
(vi) This amount only concerns GPA’s direct interest and does not include €25 million in dividends received by Via Varejo.


-----

(vii) Tuya was set up in partnership with Bancolombia to manage the banking services offered to customers of the stores in
Colombia, primarily the possibility of acquiring a store card. The partnership structure changed in October 2016 when
Éxito became a 50% shareholder of Tuya.

**3.3.2 Other investments in associates and joint ventures**

At 31 December 2017, the carrying amounts of investments in other associates and joint ventures stood at €43
million and €15 million, respectively (Note 3.3.3). The aggregate amounts of key financial statement items for
these associates and joint ventures are not material. Dividends received from these associates and joint
ventures amounted to €4 million in 2017 (2016: €2 million).

-----

**3.3.4 Impairment losses on investments in equity-accounted investees**

With the exception of Mercialys, associates and joint ventures are privately-held companies for which no quoted
market prices are available to estimate their fair value.
The fair value of the investment in Mercialys at the reporting date was €683 million, determined using the share
price on 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €712 million). This value does not reflect any impairment.
Mercialys' EPRA NNNAV at 31 December 2017 amounted to €1,887 million on a 100% basis, of which the
Group’s share was €759 million.
The impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 did not result in the recognition
of any impairment loss.

**3.3.5 Share of contingent liabilities of equity-accounted investees**

As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, none of the Group's associates and joint ventures had any
material contingent liabilities.

**3.3.6 Related party transactions (equity-accounted investees)**

The related party transactions shown below mainly concern transactions carried out in the normal course of
business on arm's length terms with companies over which the Group exercises significant influence
(associates) or joint control (joint ventures) that are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using
the equity method.

79 leases for €59 million). At 31 December 2017, future minimum lease payments due to Mercialys on property assets
amounted to €68 million, including €43 million due within one year.
(iii) Including €1,095 million in fuel purchases from Distridyn in 2017 (2016: €1,080 million).
(iv) Income of €944 million in 2017 (2016: €774 million) also includes sales of goods by Franprix-Leader Price and Distribution
Casino France to master franchisees accounted for by the equity method, for €826 million (2016: €592 million). It also
includes income related to property development transactions with Mercialys reported under "Other income" for €45 million
(2016: €77 million).

**Transactions with Mercialys**

Casino has entered into various agreements with Mercialys:
- Leases: Casino leases units in certain shopping centres from Mercialys, for which the rent is included in the
above table.
- Asset management agreement: Casino provides rental management services for nearly all Mercialys
properties. In 2017, the related management fees amounted to €6 million (2016: €6 million).
- Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 June 2012 and an
addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership's fundamental principle whereby Casino
develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth has been
maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects identified in
advance and offering satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to propose new projects
that will be examined by Casino and tracked during monitoring committee meetings.
Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary permits
have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of total projected
rental revenues from signed leases.
The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on the
basis of (i) a rent capitalisation rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by reference to the
rates used to value Mercialys' portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the project. Under the new
agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to 10% – may also be taken
into account for pricing purposes.
The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has
been maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed For


-----

example, the price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside)
difference between the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at the
outset. The contracts require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process.
In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that
could lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group's food
stores.
At the end of January 2017, the partnership agreement was extended by three years, until end-2020.
- Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, finance / accounting, IT and real estate
support services to Mercialys. In 2017, the related fees amounted to €2 million (2016: €2 million).
- Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real estate
portfolio enhancement specialists. This agreement had no material impact in 2017 or 2016.
- Exclusive sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. In 2017, the
related fees amounted to €1 million (2016: €1 million).
- Current account and cash management agreement: Casino has provided Mercialys with a €50 million
confirmed line of credit expiring in December 2020 at an annual interest rate based on the Euribor plus a
spread ranging from 40 bps to 95 bps depending on the amount borrowed under the facility. The Group
also charges a 38-bps commitment fee (40% of the maximum 95-bps spread) on undrawn amounts. This
agreement had no material impact in 2017 or 2016.

In 2017, the Group purchased five service centres from Mercialys for a total amount of €39 million as well as
the converted Toulouse Fenouillet hypermarket for €33 million.

According to the partnership agreement between Casino and Mercialys, during 2017:
- Casino sold the Jumbo Sacré Coeur shopping mall development project on Réunion Island to Mercialys for
€27 million. After eliminating a percentage equal to the Group’s interest in Mercialys, the transaction led to
the recognition of €16 million in “Other income” and a positive contribution to EBITDA of €3 million.
- Contingent consideration and margins recognised by the percentage of completion method in 2017 were
recorded by Casino on property development projects sold to Mercialys in prior periods. After eliminating a
percentage equal to the Group’s interest in Mercialys, the transactions led to the recognition of €8 million
in “Other income” and a positive contribution to EBITDA of €7 million.

Mercialys sold the following assets resulting from property development projects originally sold by Casino to
Mercialys:
- The Poitiers Beaulieu site, which was sold to a family office financed by HSBC. The transaction led to the
recognition of €13 million in "Other income" in respect of the additional portion of the property development
income previously eliminated in a proportion of 40%, and a €9 million contribution to EBITDA.
- The Fontaine-lès-Dijon shopping mall, which was sold to a fund, leading to the recognition of €5 million in
"Other income" in respect of the additional portion of the property development income previously
eliminated in a proportion of 40%, and a €3 million contribution to EBITDA.

**3.3.7 Commitments to joint ventures**

The Group has given guarantees to joint ventures (also presented in Note 6.11.1) for an amount of €125 million
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €60 million) including €65 million for CD Supply Innovation (Note 2)
and €60 million for Distridyn.


-----

###### 3.4 Commitments related to the scope of consolidation

**3.4.1 Put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests** **– “NCI puts”**


**Accounting principle**

The Group has granted put options to the owners of non-controlling interests in some of its subsidiaries.
The exercise price may be fixed or based on a predetermined formula. In accordance with IAS 32,
obligations under these NCI puts are recognised as "Financial liabilities" ; fixed price options are
recognised at their discounted present value and variable price options at fair value. The options may
be exercisable at any time or on a specified date. Since 2015, NCI puts are presented on a separate
line of the consolidated statement of financial position, "Put options granted to owners of non-controlling
interests".

IAS 27 revised, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, and
subsequently IFRS 10, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, describe the
accounting treatment of acquisitions of additional shares in subsidiaries. The Group has decided to apply
two different accounting methods for these NCI puts, depending on whether they were granted before
or after 1 January 2010, as recommended by France's securities regulator (Autorité des marchés
_financiers):_

   - NCI puts granted before the effective date of IAS 27 revised are accounted for using the goodwill

method whereby the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the
non-controlling interests is recognised in goodwill. In subsequent years, this liability is
remeasured and any changes adjust goodwill.

  - NCI puts granted since IAS 27 revised came into effect are accounted for as transactions

between shareholders, with the difference between the financial liability and the carrying
amount of the non-controlling interests recognised as a deduction from equity. In subsequent
years, this liability is remeasured and any changes adjust equity.


NCI puts can be analysed as follows at 31 December 2017:

**Commitment to** **Fixed or**

**% Group** **Non-current** **Current**
**(€ millions)** **non-controlling** **variable**

**interest** **liabilities [(iii)]** **liabilities [(iii)]**

70.00%

Éxito (Disco) [(ii)] 62.49% 29.82% V  - 119

Other 2 3

**Total NCI put liabilities** **28** **143**

(i) The value of NCI puts on subsidiaries of the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group is generally based on net profit. A 10%
increase or decrease in the indicator would not have a material impact. The exercisable periods of the options range
between 2017 and 2031.
(ii) This option is exercisable at any time until 21 June 2021. The exercise price is the lowest amount obtained using different
calculation formulas. The formula applied at 31 December 2017 is based on a multiple of 12 times average net profit for
the last two years. A 10% increase or decrease in net profit would lead to a €12 million increase or decrease in the financial
liability as at 31 December 2017.
(iii) As at 31 December 2016, NCI put liabilities amounted to €382 million, including current liabilities of €341 million. The
decrease in 2017 was mainly due to the public tender offer for Cnova N.V. shares (Note 2), which led to €187 million in
NCI put liabilities being derecognised.


-----

**3.4.2 Off-balance sheet commitments**


**Accounting principle**

Under the terms of the option contracts, the exercise price of written put and call options may be
determined using earnings multiples of the companies concerned. In this case, the options are valued
based on the latest published earnings for options exercisable at any time and earnings forecasts or
projections for options exercisable as of a given future date. In many cases, the put option written by
the Group is matched by a call written by the other party; in these cases, the value shown corresponds
to that of the written put.


Written put options on shares in non-controlled companies stand at €16 million as at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: €5 million), and concerned the Monoprix and Franprix-Leader Price sub-groups.

Call options granted to the Group on shares in non-controlled companies stand at €499 million as at
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €506 million), and mainly concerned:

- The following call options in connection with transactions carried out with Mercialys:

  - call option on 100% of the assets or 100% of the shares of Hyperthetis Participations, exercisable from
31 December 2020 and until 31 March 2022 at the higher of the fair value of the underlying and a
guaranteed minimum IRR;

  - call option on a property asset previously sold to Immosiris, exercisable between 31 March 2021 and 30
September 2022 at the higher of the fair value of the underlying and a guaranteed minimum IRR;

  - call option exercisable on 31 July 2018, at Casino’s initiative and subject to certain conditions, on either
(i) the property assets held by SCI Rennes – Anglet, valued at a fixed price of €64 million or (ii) the SCI
Rennes – Anglet shares held by OPPCI SEREIT France, valued at the company's market value (NAV),
based on the property portfolio's appraisal value of €64 million excluding transfer costs. On
30 January 2018, the Group notified OPPCI SEREIT France of its decision to exercise the call on the
70% of the SCI’s shares held by OPPCI, at an exercise price provisionally estimated at €22 million
excluding transfer costs.

- The Group also has call options on stores sold to master franchisees that are exercisable between 2018 and
2022 at prices based on a percentage of the improvement in EBITDA. Details of the transactions with these
master franchisees are provided in Notes 3.1.1, 3.2.4 and 3.2.5.

- Lastly, the Group has a call option on SCI Simonop’1 shares exercisable between 1 and 29 January 2022
or between 1 and 29 January 2023 at a price based on the company’s EPRA NNNAV.

###### 3.5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations


**Accounting principle**

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset or disposal group is classified
as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather
than through continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset (or disposal group) must be
available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management
must be committed to a plan to sell the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion
of a sale within one year of the date of this classification. Considering these characteristics, net assets
held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction
from net debt (Note 11).

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are no longer
depreciated or amortised.

A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified
as held for sale, and:

  - represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is

part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations, or

   - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

An operation represents a separate major line of business when it constitutes a reportable segment. It
is classed as discontinued if the criteria for classifying the related assets as "held for sale" have been
met or when it has already been disposed of. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when
the operation is disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for
sale.

When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of
cash flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as
from the first day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line
of the consolidated income statement, “Profit from discontinued operations”, which includes the net
profit or loss of the discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment
loss recognised to write down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or
any after-tax disposal gains or losses.

the Sarjel sub-group).

**3.5.2 Discontinued operations**

Profit from discontinued operations, mostly composed of Via Varejo (including Cnova Brazil) (Note 2), breaks

(ii) The amounts reported for 2017 mainly represent 12 months of business for Via Varejo. The amounts reported for 2016
included 12 months of business for Via Varejo, the two months of business prior to disposal of operations in Thailand
on 21 March 2016 and the four months of business prior to disposal of operations in Vietnam on 29 April 2016.
(iii) In 2017, Via Varejo reported net sales of €7,115 million and EBITDA of €414 million (2016: €6,009 million and
€251 million, respectively).
(iv) The reclassification of Via Varejo in “Discontinued operations” had no impact on other comprehensive income in 2017
or 2016. The sale of Via Varejo will not lead to any related foreign currency translation adjustments being reclassified
to profit or loss.
(v) When it was reclassified in “Discontinued operations” in 2016, in accordance with IFRS 5, Via Varejo’s fair value
(including Cnova Brazil) was estimated at €1,656 million (before estimated costs to sell of €20 million), based on the
share price of BRL 10.75 as at 31 December 2016 plus an estimated control premium. The share price was
approximately the same at 30 June 2017 and the valuation was therefore not adjusted as at that date. The fair value
measurement led to the recognition of an impairment loss of €461 million as at 31 December 2016 and €36 million as
at 30 June 2017. No additional impairment loss was recorded as at 31 December 2017, as the share price at the
year-end was BRL 24.47, representing a market value of €2,653 million before the control premium.

Earnings per share of discontinued operations are presented in Note 12.9.

**3.5.3 Net cash from/(used in) discontinued operations**

Cash flows from discontinued operations in 2017 mainly concern Via Varejo. In 2016, they included
reclassifications of cash flows from Via Varejo’s operating, investing and financing activities, and the €3,962
million proceeds from the sale of the Group’s businesses in Asia (Note 3.5.2 to the 2016 consolidated
financial statements).


-----

#### Note 4 Additional cash flow disclosures


**Accounting principle**

The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method starting from consolidated net profit
(loss) and is organised in three sections:

  - Cash flows from operating activities, including taxes, transaction costs for acquisitions of

subsidiaries, dividends received from associates and joint ventures and payments received in
respect of government grants.

   - Cash flows from investing activities, including acquisitions of subsidiaries (excluding transaction

costs), proceeds from disposals of subsidiaries (including transaction costs), acquisitions and
disposals of investments in non-consolidated companies, associates and joint ventures
(including transaction costs), contingent consideration paid for business combinations during
the measurement period and up to the amount of the identified liability, and acquisitions and
disposals of intangible assets and property plant and equipment (including transaction costs
and deferred payments), excluding finance leases.

  - Cash flows from financing activities, including new borrowings and repayments of borrowings,

issues of equity instruments, transactions between shareholders (including transaction costs
and any deferred payments), net interest paid (cash flows related to finance costs and nonrecourse factoring and associated transaction costs), treasury share transactions and dividend
payments. This category also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt.

In 2017, the net impact of these transactions on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents mainly comprised:

 - the cash sold in the transaction resulting in the loss of control of all Casino supermarkets (cash outflow of
€30 million) (Note 3.1.1)

 - the acquisition of various controlling interests in the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group (cash outflow of
€23 million) (Note 3.1.2).

 - the settlement of the balance of the price for the 2015 acquisition of control of the Super Inter stores (cash
outflow of €15 million).

In 2016, the net effect of these transactions on the Group's cash and cash equivalents resulted mainly from the
acquisition of control of Geimex (cash outflow of €44 million) (Note 3.2.6) and the acquisition of various
controlling interests in the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group (cash outflow of €32 million) (Note 3.2.4).

#### Note 5 Segment information


**Accounting principle**

In accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis
as the Group's internal reporting system used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Since 2016, following the disposal of operations in Thailand and Vietnam and the business merger
between Cnova Brazil and Via Varejo followed by their reclassification as "Assets held for sale", the
Group's reportable segments are now:

    - **France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments (mainly the Casino,**

**Monoprix, Franprix-Leader Price and Vindémia sub-group banners);**

    - **Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin**

**America (mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco - Devoto and Libertad sub-**
**group banners);**

    - **E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding**

**company.**

The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms
of product type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution
methods, marketing offer and long-term financial performance.

These reportable segments reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual
strategy and the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real
estate asset management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities.

Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales, trading profit
(which includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group's business units) and
EBITDA. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading
profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense.

Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are
therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information.

Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

GPA during the year as a deduction from “Cost of goods sold”. The tax credits were recognised following the publication
in April 2017 of the agreement for the enforcement of the October 2016 ruling by Brazil’s supreme federal court stipulating
that the ICMS-ST tax is not a final tax and should not therefore be included in the basis of assessment of PIS and COFINS
taxes, allowing GPA to apply for a refund from the Brazilian state administrations. Recognition of the pre-November 2016
ICMS-ST tax credits of Sendas Distribution (a subsidiary of GPA), in the amount of BRL 369 million (€102 million), had
no impact on the consolidated income statement because they are not expected to be recovered and were written down

#### Note 6 Activity data

###### 6.1 Total revenue


**Accounting principle**

Revenue is composed of two parts: net sales and other income.

Net sales include sales by the Group's stores, E-commerce sites, self-service restaurants and warehouses,
as well as financial services revenues, rental revenues, consumer finance revenues and other
miscellaneous services rendered by establishments.

“Other income" consists of income from the property development and property trading businesses,
miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, including
travel package sales commissions, franchising fees, contractual penalties (termination penalties paid by
tenants, franchisees, etc.) and revenues from energy efficiency activities.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of trade discounts,
volume rebates and sales taxes. It is recognised as follows:

 - revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of

the goods are transferred to the buyer (in most cases when legal title is transferred), the amount of
the revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction
will flow to the Group;

 - revenue from the sale of services, such as extended warranties, services directly related to the sale of

goods and services rendered to suppliers are recognised in the period during which they are
performed. When a service is combined with various commitments, such as volume commitments,
the Group analyses facts and legal patterns in order to determine the appropriate timing of
recognition. Accordingly, revenue may either be recognised immediately (the service is considered
as having been performed) or deferred over the period during which the service is performed or the
commitment fulfilled.


If payment is deferred beyond the usual credit period and is not covered by financing, the revenue is
discounted and the impact of discounting, if material, is recognised in financial income over the deferral
period.

Award credits granted to customers under loyalty programmes are recognised as a separately identifiable
component of the initial sales transaction. The corresponding revenue is deferred until the award credits
are used by the customer.

**(€ millions)** **2017** **2016**

Net sales **37,822** 36,030

Other income [(i)] **414** 542

**Total revenue** **38,236** **36,572**

(i) The decline in other income in 2017 was mainly due to a decrease in property development sales and in property trading
activity for €99 million.


-----

###### 6.2 Cost of goods sold


**Accounting principle**

Gross margin
Gross margin corresponds to the difference between "Net sales" and the "Cost of goods sold".

“Cost of goods sold" comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees
and any tax credits associated with the purchases, changes in retail inventories and logistics costs.

Commercial cooperation fees are measured based on contracts signed with suppliers. They are billed
in instalments over the year. At each year-end, an accrual is recorded for the amount receivable or
payable, corresponding to the difference between the value of the services actually rendered to the
supplier and the sum of the instalments billed during the year.

Change in inventories
Changes in inventories, which may be positive or negative, are determined after taking into account
any impairment losses. Changes in inventories related to property development and property trading
business are included in "Selling expenses".

Logistics costs
Logistics costs correspond to the cost of logistics operations managed or outsourced by the Group,
comprising all warehousing, handling and freight costs incurred after goods are first received at one of
the Group's stores or warehouses. Transport costs included in suppliers' invoices (e.g. for goods
purchased on a "delivery duty paid" or "DDP" basis) are included in purchase costs. Outsourced
transport costs are recognised under "Logistics costs".

Logistics costs 6.3 **(1,533)** (1,406)

**Cost of goods sold** **(28,694)** **(27,364)**

###### 6.3 Expenses by nature and function


**Accounting principle**

Selling expenses
Selling expenses consist of point-of-sale costs, property development and property trading business costs
and changes in inventories.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including
the purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions.

Pre-opening and post-closure costs
When they do not meet the criteria for capitalisation, costs incurred prior to the opening or after the closure
of a store are recognised in operating expense when incurred.

A competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE) has been introduced in France, corresponding to a tax
credit (refundable if not used within three years) based on a percentage of salaries that do not exceed 2.5x the
French minimum wage (SMIC). The rate was 7% in 2017 (6% for salaries paid as from 1 January 2018) and 9%
for Vindémia. In 2017, the CICE tax benefit of €104 million (2016: €96 million) was recognised as deduction
from employee benefits expense. The receivable was sold on a no-recourse basis for €100 million net of the
discount (2016: €88 million).

###### 6.5 Other operating income and expenses


**Accounting principle**
This caption covers two types of items:

- Income and expenses arising from major events occurring during the period that would distort analyses of

the Group's recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are
limited in number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs
(such as reorganisation costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions and
expenses for litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments).

- Income and expenses which, by definition, are not included in an assessment of a business unit's recurring

operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses
on non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope of consolidation (for
example, transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from disposals of
subsidiaries, remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests).

(i) Impairment losses recorded in 2017 mainly concerned individual assets in the France Retail segment for €36 million (primarily
Monoprix and Franprix-Leader Price for €16 million and €8 million, respectively), the Latam Retail segment (primarily GPA)
for €28 million, and the E-commerce segment for €7 million. In 2016, impairment losses primarily concerned individual assets
in the France Retail segment for €28 million (mainly Franprix-Leader Price and Distribution Casino France) and the
E-commerce segment for €10 million.
(ii) The €90 million net expense recognised in 2017 resulted mainly from the loss of control of supermarket stores at Distribution
Casino France for an amount of €30 million (Note 3.1.1), net expense related to various changes in scope at Franprix-Leader
Price for €9 million, and fees of €31 million. In 2016, the €154 million net expense resulted primarily from changes in the scope
of consolidation in the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group for €72 million (including €59 million for the transactions described in
Note 3.2.4) and Distribution Casino France for €34 million (Note 3.2.5), together with related transaction costs of €19 million,
partly offset by the €16 million effect of measuring at fair value the previously-held interest in Geimex when the Group acquired
control of this company (Note 3.2.6).
(iii) Restructuring provisions and expenses in 2017 primarily concerned the France Retail segment for €169 million (including
employee costs and store closure costs for €113 million and store transformation costs for €54 million) and the Latam Retail
segment (mainly GPA) for €38 million. Restructuring provisions and expenses for 2016 mainly concerned the France Retail
segment for €207 million (including employee costs of €58 million, rent on closed stores of €25 million, external costs of
€57 million and impairment losses and scrapped assets of €67 million) and GPA for €26 million.
(iv) Provisions and expenses for litigation and risks represented a net expense of €92 million in 2017, including €60 million for tax
amnesty programs in which GPA participated during the year, as described in Note 13.3. In 2016, provisions and charges for
litigation and risks concerned GPA for €106 million, mainly covering tax risks.
(v) The net expense for 2016 included €43 million related to the 2015 tax on retail space (TaSCom) payable in France. Following
the introduction of new tax rules which led to a change in the period in which this levy is recognised, the TaSCom due for
2015 was recognised in full at the beginning of 2016 (in "Other operating expenses") and the TaSCom for 2016 was recognised
on a straight line basis over the year (in "Trading profit").

###### 6.6 Inventories


**Accounting principle**


Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and probable net realisable value. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the
probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis takes into account the business unit's
operating environment and the type, age, turnover characteristics and sales pattern of the products
concerned.

The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by
the GPA sub-group which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA’s
inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method
was applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs
incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in
the carrying amount together with supplier discounts deducted from "Cost of goods sold". The cost of
inventories also includes gains or losses on cash flow hedges of future inventory purchases initially
accumulated in equity.

For its property development and property trading businesses, the Casino Group recognises assets and
projects in progress in inventories.


###### 6.7 Trade receivables


**Accounting principle**

Trade receivables are current financial assets (Note 11) initially recognised at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. The fair value of trade receivables usually
corresponds to the amount on the invoice. An impairment loss is recognised for trade receivables as soon
as a probable loss emerges. Trade receivables can be sold to banks and continue to be carried as assets
in the statement of financial position for as long as all the related risks and rewards are not transferred to a
third party.

**Accounting principle**

At every year-end, Management determines, to the best of its knowledge, that there are no off-balance
sheet commitments likely to have a material effect on the Group's current or future financial position other
than those described in this note.

The completeness of this information is checked by the Finance, Legal and Tax departments, which also
participate in drawing up contracts that are binding on the Group.

Commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business mainly concern the Group's operating
activities except for undrawn confirmed lines of credit, which represent a financing commitment.


Off-balance sheet commitments related to the scope of consolidation are presented in Note 3.4.2 and lease
commitments in Note 7.

**6.11.1 Commitments given**

#### Note 7 Leases


**Accounting principle**

At the inception of an agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease
agreement.
The Group's lease agreements are recognised in accordance with IAS 17 which distinguishes between
finance leases and operating leases.

Finance lease agreements
Lease agreements for property, plant and equipment that transfer nearly all the risks and benefits inherent
to ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. After initial recognition, the assets are depreciated over their expected useful
life in the same way as other assets in the same category, or over the lease term if shorter, unless the
Group has a reasonable certainty that it will obtain ownership at the end of the lease.
Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between the interest expense and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period covered by the lease agreement so as
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Operating leases
The other lease agreements are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group's
statement of financial position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Incentives received from the lessor are an integral part of the total
net rental expense and are recorded as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments (Note 7.2) correspond to fixed future minimum payments calculated over the
non-cancellable term of operating leases.


###### 7.1 Operating lease expenses

Rental expenses related to operating leases amounted to €982 million in 2017 (including €852 million for real
estate leases, of which €546 million in the France Retail segment and €222 million in Brazil) and €875 million in
2016 (including €791 million for real estate leases, of which €532 million in the France Retail segment and €183
million in Brazil). This information only concerns continuing operations.

The amount of future operating lease payments and minimum lease payments to be received under noncancellable sub-leases are presented in Note 7.2.

#### Note 8 Employee benefits expense

###### 8.1 Employee benefits expense 

Employee benefits expense is analysed by function in Note 6.3.

###### 8.2 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits


**Accounting principle**

Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits

Group companies provide their employees with various employee benefit plans depending on local laws
and practice.

- **Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and has no obligation**

to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to these plans are expensed
as incurred.

- **Under defined benefit plans, the Group's obligation is measured using the projected unit credit method**

based on the agreements effective in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives
rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the
final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to measure the
obligation vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the relevant country. The obligation
is measured by independent actuaries annually for the most significant plans and for the employment
termination benefit, and regularly for all other plans. Assumptions include expected rate of future salary
increases, estimated average years of service, life expectancy and staff turnover rates.

Actuarial gains and losses arise from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience
adjustments (differences between results based on previous actuarial assumptions and what has
actually occurred). All actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit plans are recognised
immediately in other comprehensive income.

Past service cost, corresponding to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from the introduction
of a new benefit plan or modification of an existing plan, is expensed immediately.

The expense in the income statement comprises:

     - service cost, i.e. the cost of services provided during the year, recognised in trading profit;

     - past service cost and the effect of plan curtailments or settlements, generally recognised in

"Other operating income and expenses";

     - interest cost, corresponding to the discounting adjustment to the projected benefit obligation net

of the return on plan assets, recorded in "Other financial income and expenses". Interest cost
is calculated by applying the discount rate defined in IAS 19 to the net obligation (i.e. the
projected obligation less related plan assets) recognised in respect of defined benefit plans,
as determined at the beginning of the year.

The provision recognised in the statement of financial position is measured as the net present value of
the obligation less the fair value of plan assets.

Provisions for other in-service long-term employee benefits

- **Other in-service long-term employee benefits, such as jubilees, are also covered by provisions,**

determined on the basis of an actuarial estimate of vested rights as of the reporting date. Actuarial
gains and losses on these benefit plans are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**8.2.2 Presentation of pension** **plans**

###### DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

Defined contribution plans are plans in which the company pays regular contributions into a fund. The company’s
obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute to the fund and it offers no guarantee that the fund will
have sufficient assets to pay all of the employees’ entitlements to benefits. This type of plan predominantly
concerns employees of the Group’s French subsidiaries, who are covered by the general social security system,
which is administered by the French government.

In 2017, defined contribution plans represented a cost of €334 million of which 87% concerned the Group's
French subsidiaries (2016: €335 million excluding discontinued operations and 87%).

###### DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

In certain countries, local laws or conventional agreements provide for the payment of a lump sum to employees
either when they retire or at certain times post-retirement, based on their years of service and final salary at the
age of retirement.

**8.2.3 Main assumptions used in determining total defined benefit obligations**
**(pension plans)**

Defined benefit plans are exposed to risks concerning future interest rates, salary increase and mortality rates.

The following table presents the main actuarial assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation:

**France** **International**

**2017** **2016** **2017** **2016**

Discount rate **1.5%** 1.7% **1.5% - 7.7%** 1.7% - 7.8%

Expected rate of future salary increases **1.5% - 2.0%** 1.5% - 2.0% **1.0% - 3.5%** 1.9% - 3.5%

Retirement age **62 - 65 years** 62 - 64 years **57 - 65 years** 57 - 65 years

For French companies, the discount rate is determined by reference to the Bloomberg 15-year AA corporate
composite index.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

A 50-basis point increase (decrease) in the discount rate would have the effect of reducing the projected benefit
obligation by 5.6% (increasing the projected benefit obligation by 6.2%).

A 50-basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of salary increases would have the effect of increasing
the projected benefit obligation by 6.0% (reducing the projected benefit obligation by 5.5%).

**Accounting principle**

Share-based payments

Management and selected employees of the Group receive stock options (options to purchase or subscribe
for shares) and free shares.

The benefit represented by stock options, measured at fair value on the grant date, constitutes additional
compensation. The grant-date fair value of the options is recognised in "Employee benefits expense" over
the option vesting period or in "Other operating expenses" when the benefit relates to a transaction that is
also recognised in "Other operating income and expenses" (Note 6.5). The fair value of options is
determined using the Black & Scholes option pricing model, based on the plan attributes, market data
(including the market price of the underlying shares, share price volatility and the risk-free interest rate) at
the grant date and assumptions concerning the probability of grantees remaining with the Group until the
options vest.

The fair value of free shares is also determined on the basis of the plan attributes, market data at the grant
date and assumptions concerning the probability of grantees remaining with the Group until the shares
vest. If the free shares are not subject to any vesting conditions, the cost of the plan is recognised in full on
the grant date. Otherwise it is deferred and recognised over the vesting period as and when the vesting
conditions are met. When free shares are granted to employees in connection with a transaction affecting
the scope of consolidation, the related cost is recorded in "Other operating income and expenses".


-----

Free shares are granted to certain company managers and store managers. In certain cases, the shares vest
in tranches, subject to the attainment of a performance target for the period concerned. In all cases, the shares
are forfeited if the grantee leaves the Group before the end of the vesting period.

**8.3.1 Impact of share-based payments on earnings and equity**

The total net cost of share-based payment plans recognised in the income statement in 2017 was €18 million
(2016: €15 million), including €12 million for Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and €6 million for GPA. The net cost
is balanced by a positive impact on equity for the same amount.

#### Note 9 Income tax


**Accounting principle**

Income tax expense corresponds to the sum of the current taxes due by the various Group companies,
adjusted for deferred taxes.
Substantially all qualifying French subsidiaries are members of the tax group headed by Casino, GuichardPerrachon and file a consolidated tax return.
Current tax expense reported in the income statement corresponds to the tax expense of the parent
company of the tax group and of companies that are not members of a tax group.
Deferred tax assets correspond to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences, tax
loss carryforwards, unused tax credits and certain consolidation adjustments that are expected to be
recoverable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for:

- taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability results from recognition of a nondeductible impairment loss on goodwill or from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit
nor taxable profit or the tax loss; and

- taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures,
except when the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that it will
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred taxes are recognised using the balance sheet approach and in accordance with IAS 12. They are
calculated by the liability method, which consists of adjusting deferred taxes recognised in prior periods for
the effect of any enacted changes in the income tax rate.
The Group reviews the probability of deferred tax assets being recovered on a periodic basis for each tax
entity. This review may, if necessary, lead to the derecognition of deferred tax assets recognised in prior
years. The probability for recovery is assessed based on a tax plan indicating the level of projected taxable
profits.
The taxable profit used in the assessment is based on that generally obtained over a five-year period. The
assumptions underlying the tax plan are consistent with those used in the medium-term business plans and
budgets prepared by Group entities and approved by management.

The French corporate value-added tax (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises – CVAE) which is
based on the value-added reflected in the separate financial statements, is included in "Income tax
expense" in the consolidated income statement.

When payments to holders of equity instruments are deductible for tax purposes, the tax effect is recognised
by the Group in the income statement.

(i) The reconciliation of the effective tax rate paid by the Group is based on the current French rate of 34.43%, unchanged
from 2016.
(ii) Following the review of earnings outlooks and tax options implemented at Ségisor (French holding company for the voting
shares of its Brazilian subsidiary), tax loss carryforwards in an amount of €153 million were recognised, giving rise to
deferred tax assets of €44 million. After taking into account profit for the year, deferred tax assets stand at €34 million
at 31 December 2017.
(iii) In 2017, this concerned the E-commerce segment for €32 million and the Latam Retail segment for €19 million. In 2016,
this concerned the E-commerce segment (mainly Cdiscount France) for €48 million.
(iv) Following adoption on 21 December 2017 of the 2018 Finance Act providing for a gradual reduction in the French
corporate tax rate, deferred taxes have been remeasured at the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary
differences reverse, i.e. 25.825% in 2022. This change had a positive impact on deferred taxes of €13 million.
(v) Tax laws in some countries cap the deductibility of interest paid by companies. In France, since the 2012 amended
Finance Act, companies are required to add back 25% of interest expense to their taxable profit. The resulting income
tax amounts disclosed for the periods presented mainly concern French entities.
(vi) See Note 6.3.
(vii) In 2017, the Group recorded a tax benefit of €60 million corresponding to a refund of the tax on distributed earnings
received from the French State at the end of the year.
(viii) A deferred tax expense of €10 million has been recorded in 2017 on the taxable temporary difference between the
carrying amount of Mercialys shares and their tax basis, in accordance with IAS 12 (excluding the effect of the gradual
reduction of the tax rate resulting from the 2018 Finance Act, see (iv) above). This deferred tax liability was reduced at
the year-end to take into account the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary difference reverses, leading
to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit of €23 million in 2017.

The tax saving realised by the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon tax group amounted to €243 million in 2017
(2016: €280 million).

Recognised tax loss carryforwards and tax credits mainly concern the Casino Guichard-Perrachon, Éxito and
GPA tax groups. The corresponding deferred tax assets have been recognised in the statement of financial
position as their utilisation is considered probable in view of the forecast future taxable profits of the companies
concerned. At 31 December 2017, deferred tax assets amount to €471 million for Casino, Guichard-Perrachon,
€68 million for Éxito and €50 million for GPA. These amounts are expected to be recovered by 2025 for Casino,
Guichard-Perrachon, 2021 for Éxito and 2022 for GPA.

**9.2.4 Unrecognised deferred tax assets**

As at 31 December 2017, unrecognised deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards amount to €501 million,

#### Note 10 Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property


**Accounting principle**


The cost of non-current assets corresponds to their purchase cost plus transaction expenses including tax.
For intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property, these expenses are added
to the assets' carrying amount and follow the same accounting treatment.


###### 10.1 Goodwill


**Accounting principle**


At the acquisition date, goodwill is measured in accordance with the accounting principle applicable to
"Business combinations", described in Note 3. It is allocated to the cash generating unit or groups of cash
generating units that benefit from the synergies of the combination, based on the level at which the return
on investment is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is not amortised. It is tested for
impairment at each year-end, or whenever events or a change of circumstances indicate that it may be
impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversible. The methods used by the Group to test goodwill
for impairment are described in the "Impairment of non-current assets" section in Note 10.5. Negative
goodwill is recognised directly in the income statement for the period of the business combination, once the
identification and measurement of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have
been verified.

31 December 2016 was attributable to the acquisition of control of Geimex (Note 3.2.6) for €69 million and to acquisitions
of controlling interests by Franprix-Leader Price for €35 million (Note 3.2.4).
(iii) In 2016, goodwill written off on disposals mainly concerned operations in Thailand.
(iv) Goodwill reclassified as "Assets held for sale" in 2016 mainly concerned Via Varejo.

###### 10.2 Other intangible assets


**Accounting principle**

Intangible assets acquired separately by the Group are initially recognised at cost and those acquired in
business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Intangible assets consist mainly of purchased
software, software developed for internal use, trademarks, patents and lease premiums. Trademarks that
are created and developed internally are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Intangible
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as determined separately for
each asset category. Capitalised development costs are amortised over three years and software over
three to ten years. Indefinite life intangible assets (including lease premiums and purchased trademarks)
are not amortised, but are tested for impairment at each year-end or whenever there is an indication that
their carrying amount may not be recovered.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its
use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference
between the net sale proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss
("Other operating income and expenses") when the asset is derecognised.

Residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed at each year-end and revised
prospectively if necessary.

Intangible assets were tested for impairment as at 31 December 2017 using the method described in Note 10.5
"Impairment of non-current assets". The test results are presented in the same note.

###### 10.3 Property, plant and equipment


**Accounting principle**

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditures are recognised in assets if they satisfy the recognition criteria of IAS 16. The
Group examines these criteria before incurring the expenditure.

Land is not depreciated. All other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives for each category of assets, with generally no residual value. The
main useful lives are as follows:

**Asset category** **Depreciation period (years)**

Land   
Buildings (structure) 50

Roof waterproofing 15

Fire protection of the building structure 25

Land improvements 10 to 40

Building fixtures and fittings 5 to 20

Technical installations, machinery and equipment 5 to 20

Computer equipment 3 to 5

"Roof waterproofing" and "Fire protection of the building structure" are classified as separate items of
property, plant and equipment only when they are installed during major renovation projects. In all other
cases, they are included in the "Building (structure)" category.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected from their use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an asset is determined
as the difference between the net sale proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is
recognised in profit or loss ("Other operating income and expenses") when the asset is derecognised.

Residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year-end and revised
prospectively if necessary.

Property, plant and equipment were tested for impairment as at 31 December 2017 using the method described
in Note 10.5 "Impairment of non-current assets." The test results are presented in the same note.

**10.3.3 Capitalised borrowing costs**


**Accounting principle**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (typically more than
six months) are capitalised in the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense
in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by an entity
in connection with the borrowing of funds.


Interest capitalised in 2017 amounted to €14 million, reflecting an average interest rate of 7.7% (2016:
€15 million at an average rate of 8.4%). The decrease in the capitalised amount in 2017 compared to the prior
year concerned operations in Argentina.

###### 10.4 Investment property


**Accounting principle**

Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental revenue or for capital appreciation or both.
The shopping malls owned by the Group are classified as investment property.

Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
any accumulated impairment losses. Their fair value is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements. Investment property is depreciated over the same useful life and according to the same rules
as owner-occupied property.

FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY

The main investment properties as at 31 December 2017 were held by Éxito.
As at 31 December 2017, the fair value of investment property was €798 million (31 December 2016:
€644 million). For most investment properties, fair value is determined on the basis of valuations carried out by
independent external appraisers. In accordance with international valuation standards, they are based on
market value as confirmed by market indicators, representing a level 3 fair value input.
The fair value of investment property classified as “Assets held for sale” amounted to €56 million as at
31 December 2017 and concerned the France Retail segment.

###### 10.5 Impairment of non-current assets


**Accounting principle**

The procedure to be followed to ensure that the carrying amount of assets does not exceed their
recoverable amount (recovered by use or sale) is defined in IAS 36.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an
indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually, at the end of the year,
for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.

Cash Generating Units (CGUs)
A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and that generates
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The Group has defined its cash generating units as follows:

- for hypermarkets, supermarkets and discount stores, each store is treated as a separate CGU;

- for other networks, each network represents a separate CGU.

Impairment indicators
Apart from the external sources of data monitored by the Group (economic environment, market value of
the assets, etc.), the impairment indicators used are based on the nature of the assets:

- land and buildings: loss of rent or early termination of a lease;

- operating assets related to the business (assets of the CGU): ratio of net carrying amount of store
assets divided by sales (including VAT) higher than a defined level determined separately for each
store category;

- assets allocated to administrative activities (headquarters and warehouses): site closure or
obsolescence of equipment used at the site.

Recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is
generally determined separately for each asset. When this is not possible, the recoverable amount of the
group of CGUs to which the asset belongs is used.

Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction
between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. In the retail industry, fair value less costs
to sell is generally determined on the basis of a sales or EBITDA multiple.

Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of an
asset plus a terminal value. It is determined internally or by external experts on the basis of:

- cash flow projections contained usually in business plans covering three years. Cash flows beyond this
projection period are usually estimated over a period of three years by applying a growth rate as
determined by Management (generally constant);

- a terminal value determined by applying a perpetual growth rate to the final year's cash flow projection.

The cash flows and terminal value are discounted at long-term after-tax market rates reflecting market
estimates of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset.

Impairment losses
An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or the CGU to which it belongs is
greater than its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recorded as an expense under "Other operating
income and expenses".

Impairment losses recognised in a prior period are reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
However, the increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss may
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in prior years. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed.


**10.5.1 Movements for the year**

Impairment losses recognised in 2017 on goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and
investment property totalled €76 million (Note 6.5), of which €11 million arose from restructuring operations
(mainly in the France Retail segment) and €63 million corresponded to write-downs of individual assets (mainly
in the France Retail segment for €34 million and the Latam Retail segment for €28 million).

Following the tests carried out in 2016, impairment losses totalling €115 million had been recognised on
goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, of which €58 million arose from restructuring


-----

operations mainly in the France Retail segment and €49 million corresponded to write-downs of individual assets
(primarily in the France Retail and E-commerce segments).

**10.5.2 Goodwill impairment losses**

Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amounts of the cash generating unit (CGU)
or groups of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated and comparing them with the carrying amounts of the
relevant assets. Goodwill arising on the initial acquisition of networks is allocated to the groups of CGUs in
accordance with the classifications presented in Note 10.1.1. Some goodwill may also occasionally be allocated
directly to CGUs.

Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amount of each CGU based on value in use,
in accordance with the principles described in Note 10.1. Value in use is determined by the discounted cash
flows method, based on after-tax cash flows and using the following rates.

Assumptions used in 2017 for internal calculations of values in use


**2017 perpetual**
**Region**

**growth rate [(i)]**


**2017 after-tax**

**discount rate [(ii)]**


**2016 perpetual**

**growth rate [(i)]**


**2016 after-tax**

**discount rate [(ii)]**


France (retail) [(iii)] **1.8%** **5.6%** 1.7% 5.6%

France (other businesses) [(iii)] **1.8% and 2.3%** **5.6% and 7.0%** 1.7% and 2.2% 5.6% and 7.2%

Argentina **8.8%** **15.5%** 8.5% 17.1%

Brazil [(iv)] **5.5%** **9.9%** 6.0% 12.4% and 11.6% [(vi)]

Colombia [(iv)] **3.0%** **8.8%** 3.0% 8.9%

Uruguay **6.1%** **11.8%** 6.6% 13.2%

Indian Ocean [(v)] **1.8% to 5.0%** **5.6% to 14.8%** 1.7% to 5.5% 5.6% to 14.2%

(i) The inflation-adjusted perpetual growth rate ranges from 0% to 1.5% depending on the nature of the CGU's
business/banner and country.
(ii) The discount rate corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each country. WACC is calculated at
least once a year during the annual impairment testing by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk
premium and the Group's cost of debt.
(iii) In France, the discount rate also takes account of the CGU's type of business/banner and the associated operational
risks.
(iv) As at 31 December 2017, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €5,296 million,
€2,073 million and €1,516 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than
the carrying amount of the subsidiaries' net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based
on their value in use (see below).
(v) The Indian Ocean region includes Reunion, Mayotte, Madagascar and Mauritius. The discount rates used reflect the risks
inherent in each of these regions.
(vi) The discount rate applied to cash flows is 12.4% for the three-year business plan period and 11.6% beyond to take into
account inflation and interest rate assumptions for the projection period.

No impairment loss was recognised as at 31 December 2017 from the annual goodwill impairment test
conducted at the end of the year. However, an impairment loss of €5 million was recognised during the year on
goodwill allocated to an isolated CGU.

With the exception of Franprix-Leader Price, in view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying
amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key
assumptions set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers
reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a
25-basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point
decrease in the EBITDA margin for the cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value.


-----

The recoverable amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU was determined by reference to its value in use,
calculated from cash flow projections based on three-year financial budgets approved by executive
management, extrapolation of projections over a period of three years and a 5.6% discount rate (2016: 5.6%).

The cash flow projections for the budget period were based on the following assumptions:

- deployment of the new concept at Leader Price

- ongoing deployment of a banner strategy based on a balance between integrated management stores and
franchisees

- restoration of the two banners’ profitability (EBITDA margins) to a rate in line with the historical average, led
by larger product volumes and optimised store and upstream function cost bases

Management believes that a change in a key assumption could result in a carrying amount greater than the
recoverable amount. The table below shows the individual change in each of the key assumptions that would
be required for the estimated recoverable amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU to be the same as its
carrying amount (including €2,536 million in goodwill).


**Change required for the Franprix-Leader Price CGU's carrying**
**amount to be the same as its recoverable amount**


**31 December 2017 [(i)]** **31 December 2016**


After-tax discount rate (5.6%) **+90 bps** +100 bps

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (0%) **-110 bps** -120 bps

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-125 bps** -120 bps

(i) A reasonable 100-bps increase in the discount rate, and/or a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the cash
flow projection, would result in the carrying amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU exceeding its recoverable amount
by between €0 and €300 million.

**10.5.3 Trademark impairment losses**

The recoverable amounts of trademarks were estimated at the year-end using the “discounted cash flows”
method. The main trademarks concern GPA. The Extra banner’s trademark (representing a carrying amount of
€452 million as at 31 December 2017) is the most exposed to a risk of impairment. However, the tests carried
out as at 31 December 2017 did not reveal any evidence that the trademark's carrying amount might not be
recoverable.

The table below shows the individual change in each of the key assumptions that would be required for the
estimated recoverable amount of the Extra trademark to be the same as its carrying amount:

**Change required for the Extra trademark's carrying amount to be the same as its**

**31 December 2017 [(i)]**

**recoverable amount**

After-tax discount rate (9.9%) **+180 bps**

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (1.5%) **-315 bps**

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-165 bps**

(i) A reasonable 100-bps increase in the discount rate, combined with a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the
cash flow projection and a 25-bps decrease in the perpetual growth rate, would result in the carrying amount of the Extra
CGU (including the trademark) exceeding its recoverable amount by approximately €60 million.

#### Note 11 Financial structure and finance costs


**Accounting principle**

**Financial assets**

All financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.

Financial assets are classified as current if they are due in less than one year at the closing date and noncurrent if they are due in more than one year.


The Group does not own any financial assets qualified as held-to-maturity financial assets.

_FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS_
A financial asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held
for trading or designated as such on initial recognition. These assets are initially recognised at fair value
and any subsequent changes in fair value, taking into account interest and dividends, are recorded in profit
or loss.
The Group can thus designate its short-term investments at fair value on initial recognition.

_LOANS AND RECEIVABLES_
Loans and receivables are financial assets issued or acquired by the Group in exchange for cash, goods
or services that are paid, delivered or rendered to a debtor. They are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Long-term loans and receivables that are not interest-bearing or that bear interest
at a below-market rate are discounted when the amounts involved are material. Any impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement.
This category primarily includes trade receivables, liquid assets as well as other loans and receivables.

_AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS_
Available-for-sale financial assets correspond to all other financial assets. They are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from re-measurement at fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income
until the asset is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of or until there is evidence of material or other-thantemporary impairment of the asset. In these cases, gains and losses that were previously recognised in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.
Impairment losses on available-for-sale equity instruments are irreversible and any subsequent increase in
fair value is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Any subsequent increase in fair value of available-for-sale debt instruments is recognised in the income
statement to the extent of the impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement.
This category mainly comprises investments in non-consolidated companies.

_CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS_
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term investments.
To be classified as cash equivalents under IAS 7, investments must be :

- short-term investments;

- highly liquid investments;

- readily convertible to known amounts of cash;

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Usually, the Group uses interest bearing bank accounts or term deposits of less than three months.


_DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS_
Financial assets are derecognised in the following two cases:

- the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired; or,

- the contractual rights have been transferred. In this latter case:

   - if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred,
the asset is derecognised in full;

   - if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group, the financial asset
continues to be recognised in the statement of financial position for its total amount.

The Group has set up receivables discounting programmes with banks. These programmes generally meet
the conditions for derecognition of financial assets under IAS 39 described above. The Group considers as
insignificant the risk of discounted receivables being cancelled by credit notes or being set off against
liabilities. The main receivables discounting programmes relate to GPA. The programmes are set up with
banks and credit card issuers and correspond for the most part to sales of credit card receivables (in Brazil,
it takes several weeks for vendors to receive settlement of credit card transactions). The contract terms do
not include any rights of subrogation or related obligations and the risks and rewards of ownership of the
receivables are transferred to the bank or credit card issuer which controls them.
The other receivables discounting programmes have been set up in France and relate to trade and tax
receivables; risks and rewards of ownership of those receivables are also transferred to the bank.


-----

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities are classified as current if they are due in less than one year at the closing date and noncurrent if they are due in more than one year.

_FINANCIAL LIABILITIES RECOGNISED AT AMORTISED COST_
Borrowings and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at the fair value of the
consideration received, and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Transaction costs and issue and redemption premiums directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a
financial liability are deducted from the liability's carrying amount. The costs are then amortised over the life
of the liability by the effective interest method.
Within the Group, some loans and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are hedged.

Several subsidiaries have set up reverse factoring programmes with financial institutions to enable their
suppliers to collect receivables more quickly in the ordinary course of the purchasing process.
The accounting policy for these transactions depends on whether or not the characteristics of the liabilities
concerned have been changed. For example, when trade payables are not substantially modified (term and
due date, consideration, face value) they continue to be recorded under "Trade payables". Otherwise, they
are qualified as financing transactions and included in financial liabilities under "Trade payables – structured
programme".

_FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS_
These are financial liabilities intended to be held on a short-term basis for trading purposes. They are
measured at fair value and gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value are recognised in the
income statement. The Group does not recognise any financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The accounting treatment of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests (“NCI puts”) is
described in Note 3.4.1.


**Derivative instruments**

All derivative instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position and measured at fair value.

_DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING: RECOGNITION AND PRESENTATION_
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group applies hedge accounting to:

- fair value hedges (for example, swaps to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate). In this case, the debt
is recognised at fair value up to the amount of the hedged risk and any change in fair value is recognised
in profit or loss. Gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value of the derivative are also
recognised in profit or loss. If the hedge is entirely effective, the loss or gain on the hedged debt is
offset by the gain or loss on the derivative;

- cash flow hedges (for example, swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate or to change the
borrowing currency, and hedges of budgeted purchases billed in a foreign currency). For these hedges,
the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in profit and loss
and the effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified
to profit or loss on a symmetrical basis with the hedged cash flows in terms of both timing and
classification (i.e. in trading profit for hedges of operating cash flows and in net financial income and
expense for other hedges);

- hedges of net investments in foreign operations. For these hedges, the effective portion of the change
in fair value attributable to the hedged foreign currency risk is recognised net of tax in other
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised directly in financial income or expense.
Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss on the
date of liquidation or disposal of the net investment.

Hedge accounting may only be used if:

- the hedging relationship is clearly defined and documented at inception; and

- the effectiveness of the hedge can be demonstrated at inception and throughout its life.

_DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING: RECOGNITION AND_
_PRESENTATION_
When a derivative financial instrument does not qualify or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting,
successive changes in its fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss for the period under "Other
financial income and expenses".

**Definition of net debt**


Net debt corresponds to loans and other borrowings including derivatives designed as fair value hedge
(liabilities) and trade payables – structured programme, less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial
assets held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments, (iii) derivatives designated as
fair value hedge (assets), (iv) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets and
(v) net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary.

###### 11.3 Net financial income (expense)


**Accounting principle**

**Net finance costs**

Net finance costs correspond to all income and expenses generated by cash and cash equivalents and
financial liabilities during the period, including income from cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses on
disposals of cash equivalents, interest expense on financial liabilities, gains and losses on interest rate
hedges (including the ineffective portion) and related currency effects, and trade payable – structured
program costs.

**Other financial income and expenses**

This item corresponds to financial income and expenses that are not included in net finance costs.

It includes dividends received from non-consolidated companies, non-recourse factoring and associated
transaction costs, discounting adjustments (including to provisions for pensions and other post-employment
benefit obligations), gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value of equity derivatives, and
impairment losses and realised gains and losses on financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents.
Exchange gains and losses are also recorded under this caption, apart from (i) exchange gains and losses
on cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities, which are presented under net finance costs, and (ii)
the effective portion of accounting hedges of operating transactions, which are included in trading profit.

Financial discounts for prompt payments are recognised in financial income for the portion corresponding
to the normal market interest rate and as a deduction from cost of goods sold for the supplement.

(i) The net gain of €47 million on remeasurement at fair value of non-hedging derivative instruments reported in 2017 mainly
reflects (a) positive fair value adjustments to the GPA TRS (€32 million) and GPA forward (€51 million), less the cost of
carry associated with these instruments (€15 million); and (b) negative fair value adjustments to other derivative
instruments (€21 million). In 2016, the net gain of €69 million primarily reflected positive fair value adjustments to the GPA
TRS (€30 million), the GPA forward (€15 million) and the Big C Thailand TRS (€23 million) which was unwound during
the period.

The total return swap (TRS) and forward contracts on GPA shares are cash-settled instruments. The
documentation states that when the contracts expire, the shares will be sold on the market by the banking
counterparties, and the Group will receive or pay the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid
by the counterparties to purchase the shares at the contracts' inception. The Group retains the economic
benefits of ownership of the shares (exposure to changes in the subsidiaries’ share prices and collection of
dividends) but does not have legal title to the shares and cannot exercise the related voting rights. Details of the
contracts are as follows:

- In December 2011, the Group entered into a 2.5-year TRS with a financial institution on 7.9 million GPA
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The contract's maturity was extended on 23 December 2016 and
again on 27 October 2017. The interest rate is currently set at the 3-month Euribor plus 199 bps and the
contract expires in June 2020. This TRS is a derivative instrument measured at fair value through profit or
loss. As at 31 December 2017, it related to 7.8 million ADRs (2.9% of GPA’s capital) representing a notional
amount of €332 million, and had a negative fair value of €177 million (31 December 2016: 7.8 million ADRs,
a notional amount of €332 million and a negative fair value of €209 million).

- At the end of December 2012, the Group entered into a 2-year forward contract with a financial institution
on 5.8 million GPA shares. On 28 July 2016, the maturity was extended and the notional amount was
reduced by USD 105 million (€95 million), resulting in a cash payment made by the Group on the same day.
The maturity was extended again in June 2017. The interest rate currently corresponds to the 3-month Libor
plus 204 bps and the contract expires in February 2020. This forward is a derivative instrument measured
at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31 December 2017, it related to 5.8 million shares (2.2% of GPA's
capital) representing a notional amount of USD 239 million (€199 million), and had a negative fair value of
€83 million (31 December 2016: 5.8 million shares, a notional amount of USD 239 million (€227 million) and
a negative fair value of €134 million).

In 2012, the Group entered into a TRS with a financial institution on 20.6 million Big C Thailand shares. The
TRS was settled in 2016, leading to the recognition of €23 million in "Other financial income" corresponding to
the net cash settlement on the TRS for €2 million and the positive change of fair value for €21 million.

These instruments’ fair value is determined based on the estimated settlement price on 31 December, using the
share price on that date. The instruments had a negative fair value of €260 million as at 31 December 2017
(2016: negative fair value of €343 million) (Note 11.5.1).


-----

###### 11.4 Fair value of financial instruments


**Accounting principle**

Fair value measurements are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the
inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);

- inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices)

or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2);

- inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)

(Level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is the quoted price on the reporting date.
A market is considered active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer,
broker, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring
market transactions on an arm's length basis. These instruments are classified as Level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments which are not quoted in an active market (such as over-the-counter
derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques use observable market data
wherever possible and make little use of the Group's own estimates. If all the inputs required to calculate
fair value are observable, the instrument is classified as Level 2.

If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as
Level 3.


**11.4.1 Financial assets and liabilities by category of instrument**

**FINANCIAL ASSETS**

The following table shows financial assets by category.

(i) The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is generally measured using standard valuation techniques. If their fair
value cannot be determined reliably, they are not included in this note.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments are valued (internally or externally) on the basis of the widely used valuation techniques
for this type of instruments. Valuation models are based on observable market inputs (mainly the yield curve) and
counterparty quality. Derivatives held as fair value hedges are almost fully backed by borrowings.
(iii) The fair value of bonds is based on the latest quoted price on the reporting date.
(iv) The fair value of other borrowings has been measured using other valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow
method, taking into account the Group's credit risk and interest rate conditions at the reporting date.
(v) The fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests is measured by applying the contract's
calculation formulas and is discounted, if necessary. These formulas are considered to be representative of fair value and
notably use net profit multiples.

###### 11.5 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The main risks associated with the Group's financial instruments are market risks (foreign currency risk, interest
rate risk and equity risk), counterparty risk and liquidity risk.

Financial risk monitoring and management is the responsibility of the Corporate Finance department, which is
part of the Group Finance department. This team manages all financial exposures in coordination with the
finance departments of the Group's main subsidiaries and reports to executive management. It has issued a
Good Financial Practice Guide governing all financing, investment and hedging transactions carried out by
Group entities.

The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risks and foreign currency risks using derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps and options (caps, floors, swaptions), currency swaps, forward currency
contracts and currency options. These instruments are mainly over-the-counter instruments contracted with firstclass bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting.
However, like many other large corporates, the Group may take very small, strictly controlled speculative
positions as part of its hedging policy, for more dynamic and flexible management of its interest rate and
currency exposures.

As at 31 December 2017, derivatives held as fair value hedges (on a notional amount of €5,304 million) had a
positive net fair value of €65 million. The total included (i) interest rate hedges in France on a notional amount of
€4,472 million with a positive fair value of €83 million and (ii) currency and interest rate hedges in Brazil (on a
notional amount of €219 million) with a negative fair value of €14 million and Colombia (on a notional amount of
€401 million) with a negative fair value of €4 million. All the currency and interest rate derivatives are backed by
bank borrowings or bonds denominated in a currency other than the borrower entity’s functional currency. The
ineffective portion of these fair value hedges is not material.

As at 31 December 2017, the cash flow hedge reserve included in equity had a debit balance of €16 million
(31 December 2016: credit balance of €11 million). These derivatives concern operations in France, and
Colombia. In France, they hedge goods purchases billed in currencies other than the euro (mainly the US dollar).
Their notional amount as at 31 December 2017 was USD 307 million (€256 million – Note 11.5.2). In Colombia,
the notional amount hedged by the derivatives is €55 million. Moreover, the Colombian subsidiary Éxito applies
cash flow hedge accounting regarding the hedging of interest rates on variable rate borrowings for a notional
amount of €390 million at 31 December 2017. The ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is not material.

Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 had a negative fair value of
€260 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: negative fair value of €328 million) including TRSs and
forward contracts with a negative fair value of €260 million (31 December 2016: negative fair value of €343 million)
(Note 11.3.2).

The fair value calculation as at 31 December 2017 takes into account the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and
the debit valuation adjustment (DVA) in accordance with IFRS 13. The impact of these adjustments is not
material.

**11.5.2 Market risk**

**INTEREST RATE RISK**

The Group’s objective is to manage its exposure to the risk of interest rate changes and optimise its financing
cost. Its strategy therefore consists of dynamic debt management by monitoring and, where necessary,
adjusting its hedging ratio based on forecast trends in interest rates.

Various derivative instruments are used to manage interest rate risks. The main instruments are interest rate
swaps and options (caps, floors, swaptions). Group financial policy consists of managing finance costs by
combining variable and fixed-rate derivative instruments. These instruments do not always qualify for hedge
accounting; however all interest-rate instruments are contracted in line with the above risk management policy.

Specifically, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt is mainly composed of fixed-rate bonds (representing a
principal amount of €5,614 million as at 31 December 2017 – Note 11.2.3). This bond debt may be hedged
through fixed-to-variable rate swaps generally contracted at the issue date; all of these hedges qualify for hedge
accounting.

During 2017, the Group unwound interest rate swaps hedging the bonds that were bought back and cancelled
during the year. The Group also reduced its exposure to variable interest rates by unwinding fixed-to-variable
interest rate swaps as well as purchasing interest rate options (collars).
As at 31 December 2017, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon had a portfolio of 40 interest rate swaps with a dozen
bank counterparties, representing variable or capped variable rate exposure of respectively €2,672 and €900
million. The swaps expire at various dates between 2019 and 2026.
As at 31 December 2017, 52% of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon’s bond debt (€2,942 million) was hedged,
including 36% at fixed rates (€2,042 million), 16% at capped variable rates (€900 million) and 48% at variable
rates (€2,672 million).

**SENSITIVITY TO A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES**

Sensitivity to rate changes is calculated as shown in the table below.

representing €717 million).
(v) Including borrowings in Colombia originally denominated in COP or USD for COP 2,581 billion (€721 million), of which
62% swapped for variable rate debt in COP by means of cross-currency swaps where applicable (31 December 2016:
COP 1,249 billion, representing €395 million, of which 44% swapped for variable rate debt).

Assuming the net debt structure and management policy are constant, a 100-bps annual increase (decrease)
in rates across the yield curve would lead to a 5.7% or €21 million increase (4.9% or €18 million decrease) in


-----

finance costs. For the purposes of the analysis, all other variables, particularly exchange rates, are assumed to
be constant.

**EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK**
Due to its geographically diversified business base, the Group is exposed to both currency translation risk and
to transaction risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro.
Translation risk (or balance sheet currency risk) is the risk of an unfavourable change in the exchange rates
used to translate the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone into euros for inclusion
in the consolidated financial statements adversely affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated statement
of financial position and income statement, leading to a deterioration of the Group’s gearing ratios.
Transaction risk is the risk of an unfavourable change in exchange rates that adversely affects a cash flow
denominated in foreign currency.

The Group's policy for managing transaction risk is to hedge highly probable budgeted exposures, which mainly
concern cash flows arising from purchases made in a currency other than the buyer’s functional currency and
particularly purchases in US dollars which are hedged using forward contracts. As a general principle, budgeted
purchases are hedged using instruments with the same maturities as the underlying transactions.
Currency risks on debts denominated in a currency other than the borrower’s functional currency are
systematically hedged, except where the debt represents a designated and documented hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation.

The Group's net exposure based on notional amounts after hedging mainly concerns the US dollar (excluding
the functional currencies of entities), as shown below:


**Total exposure**

**Hedges of future purchases** **256** **256** **276**

**Exposed put options granted to owners of non-controlling**
**119** **119** **115**
**interests [(i)]**

(i) Changes in fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests (including the effect of movements in
exchange rates) have no impact on profit or loss, because the puts are treated as transactions between owners and
changes in their fair value are therefore recorded directly in equity (Note 3.4.1).

As at 31 December 2016, the net statement of financial position exposure of €343 million mainly concerned the
US dollar.

**SENSITIVITY OF NET EXPOSURE AFTER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING**

A 10% appreciation of the euro as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 against the foreign currencies included in
the Group's exposure would lead to an increase in profit for the amounts indicated in the table below.
For the purposes of the analysis, all other variables, particularly interest rates, are assumed to be constant.

**(€ millions)** **2017** **2016**

US dollar **26** 36

Other currencies **(4)** (2)

**Impact on net financial income (expense)** **21** **34**

A 10% decline in the euro against those currencies as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 would have produced
the opposite effect.

**SENSITIVITY TO TRANSLATION RISK**

A 10% appreciation of the euro compared to the Group’s other main currencies would have the following impact
on the translation into euros of the sales, profit and equity of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
euro:

**2017** **2016**

**(€ millions)**

Equity **(649)** **(50)** (745) (40)

A 10% decline in the euro against those currencies would have produced the opposite effect.
For the purposes of the analysis, all other variables are assumed to be constant.

**EQUITY RISK**

As at 31 December 2017, the Group did not hold any significant investments in any listed companies other than
its listed subsidiaries or treasury shares.

The Group may use derivative instruments (e.g. total return swaps with no call option, forward contracts, puts
and calls) on equities to build a synthetic exposure to the shares of its listed subsidiaries (Note 11.3.2) or a
synthetic hedge of a financial exposure to a fall in stock prices. The carrying amount of these instruments
corresponds to their estimated value as provided by a financial institution on the reporting date. These values
take account of market data such as exchange rates, share prices and interest rates.

In addition, the Group does not hold any options or any derivatives backing its own shares. Its policy as regards
cash management is to invest only in money market instruments that are not exposed to equity risk.


-----

**11.5.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group is exposed to various aspects of counterparty risk through its operating activities, cash deposits and
interest rate and currency hedging instruments. It monitors these risks regularly using several objective
indicators, and diversifies its exposure by dealing with the least risky counterparties (based mainly on their credit
ratings and their reciprocal commitments with the Group).

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO TRADE RECEIVABLES**

Customer credit risk:
Group policy consists of checking the financial health of all customers applying for credit payment terms.
Customer receivables are regularly monitored; consequently, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not material.

Trade receivables break down as follows by maturity:

**Past-due receivables on the reporting date, not**

**impaired**

**Receivables**

**Between one** **Impaired**

**(€ millions)** **not yet due,** **Up to one** **More than** **Total**

**and six** **receivables**

**not impaired** **month past** **six months** **Total**

**months past**

**due** **past due**

**due**

**31 December 2017** **737** **69** **36** **34** **139** **153** **1,029**

**31 December 2016** 721 79 15 26 119 117 957

The age of unimpaired past-due receivables can vary considerably depending on the type of customer,
i.e. private companies, consumers or public authorities. Impairment policies are determined on an entity-byentity basis according to customer type. As indicated above, the Group believes that its exposure to credit
concentration risk is not material.

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO OTHER ASSETS**

Credit risk on other financial assets – mainly comprising cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial
assets, loans, legal deposits paid by GPA and certain derivative financial instruments – corresponds to the risk
of failure by the counterparty to fulfil its obligations. The maximum risk is limited and equal to the instruments’
carrying amount. The Group’s cash management policy consists of investing cash and cash equivalents with
first-class counterparties and in first-class rated instruments.

**11.5.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group's liquidity policy is to ensure, to the extent possible, that it always has sufficient liquid assets to settle
its liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market conditions.
The main methods used consist of:

- diversifying sources of financing to include capital markets, private placements, banks (confirmed and
unconfirmed facilities), negotiable European commercial paper (NEU CP) programmes and discounting
facilities;

- diversifying financing currencies to include the euro, the Group's other functional currencies and the
US dollar;

- maintaining a level of confirmed financing facilities significantly in excess of the Group's payment
obligations at all times;

- limiting the amount of annual repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule;

- managing the average maturity of financing facilities and, where appropriate, refinancing them before
they fall due.

The liquidity analysis is performed both at the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon holding company level (taking into
account the cash pool operated with all French subsidiaries) and for each of the Group's international
subsidiaries.


-----

In addition, the Group has non-recourse receivables discounting programmes, with no continuing involvement
in the receivables within the meaning of IFRS 7, as well as reverse factoring programmes.
As at 31 December 2017, trade payables totalling €1,636 million had been reverse factored, including
€573 million in France Retail payables, €959 million in Latam Retail payables and €104 million in E-commerce
payables.

Most of the Group’s debt is carried by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and is not secured by collateral or any
secured assets. Financing is managed by the Corporate Finance department. The main subsidiaries (GPA,
Monoprix and Éxito) also have their own financing facilities, which are not secured by collateral or any security
interests in assets and are not guaranteed by Casino (except for GPA loans from BNDES totalling €11 million
as at 31 December 2017 that are secured by security interests in the assets).

All subsidiaries submit weekly cash reports to the Group and all new financing facilities require prior approval
from the Corporate Finance department.

As at 31 December 2017, the Group's liquidity position comprised:

- confirmed, undrawn lines of credit for a total of €3,697 million (of which €3,268 million for France);

- unrestricted cash of €3,391 million.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon has a €9,000 million Euro medium term notes (EMTN) programme. Notes issued
under the programme totalled €5,614 million as at 31 December 2017.

As at the same date, issuance under Casino, Guichard-Perrachon’s €2,000 million negotiable European
commercial paper (NEU CP) programme amounted to €210 million.

The Company's bond issues (other than deeply subordinated perpetual notes) have been rated BB+ with a
stable outlook by Standard & Poor's since 21 March 2016 and Ba1 by Moody’s since 30 November 2017. In line
with the policy of rating agencies rotation, as recommended by the European regulator, Moody’s Investors
Service (“Moody’s”) has been appointed as a new rating agency of the Group. Simultaneously with Moody’s
appointment, the Group terminated its contract with Fitch Ratings ; since 12 January 2018, Casino, GuichardPerrachon and its bond issues are no longer rated by Fitch.
Standard & Poor's rating downgrade from BBB- to BB+ triggered application of coupon step-up clauses providing
for a 125-bps interest rate step-up on Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's bond issues in the event of the Company
being rated non-investment grade by at least one of its rating agencies. The step-up was gradual : it is applicable
to each bond issue as from the first annual interest period having begun after 21 March 2016. The impact on
2017 finance costs was an increase of €61 million (2016: €15 million).
The bond indentures (other than for deeply subordinated perpetual bonds) also include a step down clause
providing for a return to the original interest rate if Standard & Poor's and Moody’s restore Casino, GuichardPerrachon's investment grade rating.

The Group's bank loan agreements and bond documentation include the usual pari passu negative pledge and
cross default clauses.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's facility agreements generally contain a mandatory acceleration clause in the
event of a change of control of the Company.

In addition, bonds issued by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon (except for two deeply subordinated perpetual bond
issues) contain a discretionary acceleration clause applicable if the Company’s long-term senior debt rating is
downgraded to non-investment grade (or further downgraded if the rating is already non-investment grade), but
only if this downgrade is due to a change of majority shareholder (i.e. if a third party other than Rallye or one of
its related companies acquires more than 50% of Casino’s voting rights).

**CASINO,** **GUICHARD-PERRACHON DEBT COVENANTS**

At the reporting date, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt was subject to the following hard covenants to be met
at each year-end:


**Frequency**
**Type of covenant** **Main types of debt subject to covenant**


**Ratio as at 31**

**December**

**2017**


Consolidated net debt [(i) ]

/Consolidated EBITDA [(ii)] < 3.5


Annually **2.69**


Consolidated net debt [(i) ]

                      - €50 million bilateral credit line
/Consolidated EBITDA [(ii)] < 3.7

(i) Net debt as defined in the loan agreements may differ from net debt presented in the consolidated financial statements
(Note 11.2). It corresponds to borrowings and financial liabilities including hedging instruments with a negative fair value,
less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and short-term financial
investments, (iii) derivatives with a positive fair value classified as hedges of debt and (iv) financial assets arising from a
significant disposal of non-current assets.
(ii) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) corresponds to trading profit plus recurring net
depreciation and amortisation expense.

The Group considers that it will very comfortably fulfil its covenants over the next 12 months.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's bonds and negotiable European commercial paper (NEU CP) issues are not
subject to any financial covenants.

**FINANCING OF SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO COVENANTS**

(i) All of GPA's covenants are based on consolidated indicators for the GPA sub-group.
(ii) Debt less cash, cash equivalents and receivables.
(iii) Consolidated equity (attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests).

These covenants were respected as at 31 December 2017.

**EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY RISK**

The table below presents an analysis by maturity of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2017, including
principal and interest and for undiscounted amounts. For derivative financial instruments, the table has been
drawn up based on the contractual net cash inflows and outflows on instruments that settle on a net basis and
the gross inflows and outflows on those instruments that require gross settlement. For interest rate instruments,
when the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount presented has been determined by reference
to observed yield curves as at the reporting date.

For the TRS and forward instruments described in Note 11.3.2, the cash flows presented in the table below
reflect the interest payable and the fair value of instruments as at the reporting date.

|Type of covenant|Frequency of tests|
|---|---|
|Net debt/EBITDA < 2.5|Annually|
|Net debt (ii) may not be higher than equity (iii)|Quarterly/half- yearly/annually|

#### Note 12 Equity and earnings per share


**Accounting principle**

Equity is attributable to two categories of owner: the owners of the parent (Casino, Guichard-Perrachon
shareholders) and the owners of the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries. A non-controlling interest
is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent.

Transactions with the owners of non-controlling interests resulting in a change in the parent company's
percentage interest without loss of control affect only equity as there is no change of control of the economic
entity. Cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a fully consolidated subsidiary that do not
result in a loss of control (including increases in percentage interest) are classified as cash flows from
financing activities.

In the case of an acquisition of an additional interest in a fully consolidated subsidiary, the Group recognises
the difference between the acquisition cost and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests as a
change in equity attributable to owners of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon. Transaction costs are also
recognised in equity. The same treatment applies to transaction costs relating to disposals without loss of
control. In the case of disposals of controlling interests involving a loss of control, the Group derecognises
the whole of the ownership interest and, where appropriate, recognises any investment retained in the
former subsidiary at its fair value. The gain or loss on the entire derecognised interest (interest sold and
interest retained) is recognised in profit or loss under "Other operating income" or "Other operating
expenses", which amounts to remeasuring the retained previously-held investment at fair value through
profit or loss. Cash flows arising from the acquisition or loss of control of a subsidiary are classified as cash
flows from investing activities.

Equity instruments and hybrid instruments
The classification of instruments issued by the Group in equity or debt depends on each instrument's
specific characteristics. An instrument is deemed to be an equity instrument when the following two
conditions are met:

   - the instrument does not contain a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to

another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; and

   - in the case of a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments, it is either

a non-derivative that does not include a contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of the
entity's own equity instruments, or it is a derivative that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.

The Group also examines the special provisions of contracts to ensure the absence of an indirect obligation
to buy back the equity instruments in cash or by delivering another financial asset or by delivering shares
with a value substantially higher than the amount of cash or the other financial asset to be delivered.

In particular, instruments that are redeemable at the Group's discretion and for which the remuneration
depends on the payment of a dividend are classified in equity.

When a "debt" component exists, it is measured separately and classified under "financial liabilities".

Equity transaction costs
External and qualifying internal costs directly attributable to equity transactions or transactions involving
equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity, net of tax. All other transaction costs are
recognised as an expense.

Treasury shares
Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares purchased by the Group are deducted from equity at cost. The
proceeds from sales of treasury shares are credited to equity with the result that any disposal gains or
losses, net of the related tax effect, have no impact in the income statement for the period.

Options on treasury shares
Options on treasury shares are treated as derivative instruments, equity instruments or financial liabilities
depending on their characteristics.
Options classified as derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Options classified as
equity instruments are recorded in equity at their initial amount and changes in value are not recognised.
The accounting treatment of financial liabilities is described in Note 11.

###### 12.1 Capital management

The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to preserve the confidence of investors, creditors
and the markets while ensuring the financial headroom required to support the Group's future business
development. The Group aims to continually optimise its financial structure by maintaining an optimum balance
between net debt, EBITDA and equity. To this end, it may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
return part of the capital to shareholders, buy back its own shares or issue new shares. From time to time, the
Group may buy back its own shares in the market. The shares are generally acquired for allocation to a liquidity
contract used to make a market in the shares, or to be held for allocation under stock option plans, employee
share ownership plans or free share plans for Group employees and corporate officers.

The policy objectives and management procedures are exactly the same as in previous years.

Apart from legal requirements, the Group is not subject to any external minimum capital requirements.

###### 12.2 Share capital

As at 31 December 2017, the Company's share capital amounted to €169,825,404 and was composed of
110,996,996 ordinary shares issued and fully paid as at that date (unchanged from 31 December 2016).
Ordinary shares have a par value of €1.53.
Under the shareholder authorisations given to the Board of Directors, the share capital may be increased,
immediately or in the future, by up to €59 million.

###### 12.3 Share equivalents

The Group is committed to granting free shares under various plans (Note 8.3). The Group intends to fulfil its
obligations under those plans using existing shares.

###### 12.4 Treasury shares

Treasury shares result from shareholder-approved buybacks of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. shares. As at
31 December 2017, a total of 107,735 shares were held in treasury, representing €5 million. The shares were
purchased primarily for allocation upon exercise of the rights under free share plans.

In January 2005, the Group entered into a liquidity agreement with the Rothschild investment bank for a total of
700,000 Casino shares plus a contribution of €40 million in cash, in compliance with European Commission
Regulation (EC) No. 2273/2003. The Group made additional contributions to the liquidity agreement of
(i) €30 million on 25 September 2015 and (ii) €50 million on 28 December 2015. The 700,000 shares were
subsequently cancelled by decision of the Board of Directors on 14 June 2016.

As at 31 December 2017, no Casino, Guichard-Perrachon S.A. shares were held in the liquidity account.

The cash earmarked for the liquidity agreement is invested in money market mutual funds. These funds qualify
as cash equivalents and are therefore included in net cash and cash equivalents.

###### 12.5 Deeply subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI)

At the beginning of 2005, the Group issued 600,000 deeply subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI) for a total
amount of €600 million. The bonds are redeemable solely at the Group's discretion and interest payments are
due only if the Group pays a dividend on its ordinary shares in the preceding 12 months. The bonds pay interest
at the 10-year constant maturity swap rate plus 100 bps, capped at 9%. In 2017, the average coupon was
1.71%.

On 18 October 2013, the Group issued €750 million of perpetual hybrid bonds (7,500 bonds) on the market.
The bonds are redeemable at the Group’s discretion with the first call date set for 31 January 2019. They pay a
coupon of 4.87% until that date, after which the rate will be revised every five years.

Given their specific characteristics in terms of maturity and remuneration, the bonds are carried in equity for the
amount of €1,350 million. Issuance costs net of tax have been recorded as a deduction from equity.

Cnova Brazil and Cdiscount – are presented respectively in the "Via Varejo" and "Other" columns at 31 December 2016
and 2017.
(ii) Éxito excluding GPA, including Uruguay and Argentina.
(iii) Including SCI Simonop’1 at 31 December 2017 for €66 million (31 December 2016: €66 million).
Including Monoprix for €488 million as at 1 January 2016, of which €420 million corresponding to the equity component
of the mandatory convertible bonds issued on 27 December 2013 to CACIB, net of issuance costs and tax and €68
million corresponding to the SCI Simonop'1 transaction.
(iv) The percentages of non-controlling interests set out in this table do not include the Group's own non-controlling interests
in sub-groups.
(v) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists mainly of exchange differences arising on translation of foreign subsidiaries'
financial statements.
(vi) The negative impact of €953 million in 2016 resulted mainly from the loss of control of Big C Thailand (€470 million),
exercise of the call option on Monoprix mandatory convertible bonds (€419 million), acquisition of Éxito and GPA shares
(€34 million), the change in value of the Disco NCI puts (€25 million) and reorganisation of the E-commerce business
(€44 million), partially offset by the sale to outside investors of interests in the Viva Malls real estate trust in Colombia
(€115 million).

GPA's capital consists of:
- 99,680 thousand ordinary shares with voting rights;
- 166,900 thousand preferred shares without voting rights but with the right to a preferred dividend.
Preferred shares do not carry voting rights, but instead entitle holders to the following rights and benefits: (i) a
preferred right to a return of capital in the event of liquidation of the company, (ii) an annual non-cumulative
preferred dividend of at least BRL 0.08 per share; (iii) a second preferred dividend equal to 10% of the dividend
paid on ordinary shares, as calculated including the non-cumulative dividend referred to in point (ii).
Casino has not granted any put options to holders of non-controlling interests in GPA. Under Brazilian securities
regulations, preferred shareholders have withdrawal rights enabling them to ask GPA to buy back their shares
at book value (i.e. net asset value per share) following the occurrence of certain specific events. These rights
are described in detail on pages 93 et seq of GPA's annual report for 2016 on Form 20-F.

representing a total payout of €350 million). An interim dividend of €1.56 per share for 2016 (representing a total
of €171 million) was paid in November 2016.

During its meeting on 10 November 2017, the Board of Directors decided to pay a 2017 interim dividend of
€1.56 per share. The ex-dividend date for the interim dividend was 7 December 2017 and the dividend was paid
on 11 December 2017. The interim dividend was paid on 110,887,560 shares, representing a total payout of
€173 million recorded as a deduction from equity.

The Board of Directors will recommend setting the total 2017 dividend at €3.12 per ordinary share. Based on
110,996,996 shares as at 31 December 2017, the recommended dividend represents a provisional amount of
€346 million. It will be adjusted in 2018 to take into account the treasury shares held on the payment date. The
financial statements presented before appropriation of profit do not reflect this dividend, which is subject to
shareholder approval at the next Annual General Meeting.

###### 12.9 Earnings per share


**Accounting principle**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period, excluding shares issued in payment of dividends and treasury shares. Diluted earnings
per share are calculated by the treasury stock method, as follows:

 - numerator: earnings for the period are adjusted for interest on mandatory convertible bonds and
dividends on deeply subordinated perpetual bonds;

 - denominator: the basic number of shares is adjusted to include potential shares corresponding to
dilutive instruments (equity warrants, stock options and free shares), less the number of shares that
could be bought back at market price with the proceeds from the exercise of the dilutive instruments.
The market price used for the calculation corresponds to the average share price for the year.

Equity instruments that will or may be settled in Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares are included in the
calculation only when their settlement would have a dilutive impact on earnings per share.

#### Note 13 Other provisions


**Accounting principle**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are discounted when the
related adjustment is material.
In accordance with the above principle, a provision is recorded for the cost of repairing equipment sold with
a warranty. The provision represents the estimated cost of repairs to be performed during the warranty
period, as estimated on the basis of actual costs incurred in prior years. Each year, part of the provision is
reversed to offset the actual repair costs recognised in expenses.

A provision for restructuring expenses is recorded when the Group has a constructive obligation to
restructure. This is the case when management has drawn up a detailed, formal plan and has raised a valid
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by announcing its main features to them
before the period-end.

Other provisions concern specifically identified liabilities and expenses.

Contingent liabilities correspond to possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence
will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group’s
control, or present obligations whose settlement is not expected to require an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position
but are disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements.

(ii) Provisions used during the year (€51 million) mainly concern GPA and relate to the new tax amnesty programme
(Note 13.3).
(iii) Unused provisions reversed during the year (€127 million) primarily concern GPA and notably reflect favourable
developments in the dispute regarding the exclusion of the ICMS tax from the PIS and COFINS tax base (Note 13.3).

Provisions for claims and litigation, and for other risks and expenses are composed of a wide variety of
provisions for employee-related disputes, property disputes (concerning construction or refurbishment work,
rents, tenant evictions, etc.), tax disputes and business claims (trademark infringement, etc.).

Provisions for claims and litigation amount to €530 million and mainly concern GPA (Note 13.2).

###### 13.3 Contingent assets and liabilities

In the normal course of its business, the Group is involved in a number of legal or arbitration proceedings with
third parties or with the tax authorities in certain countries (of which mainly GPA – see below – and France Retail
concerning tax disputes representing a risk of €36 million.

In addition to contingent liabilities mentioned below, the Group is under two prosecutions by the DGCCRF as
described in note 2.

As stated in Note 3.3.5, no associates or joint ventures have any significant contingent liabilities.

- **Defence proceedings initiated by the sellers of a controlling interest in Globex Utilidades**
**SA**

On 14 August 2015, GPA and Wilkes were jointly ordered by an international court of arbitration to pay
compensation to the former majority shareholder of Globex Utilidades SA – Morzan Empreendimentos – in
settlement of a dispute that arose in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in this company,
now named Via Varejo SA. The total cost of €113 million, including interest and legal fees, was shared equally
between GPA and Wilkes, GPA’s holding company, and was reported under “Other operating expenses” in the
2015 income statement. The compensation was paid on 1 April 2016.
On 17 November 2015, GPA and Wilkes brought an action for annulment (without suspensive effect) before the
Paris Court of Appeal, whose ruling is not expected before the second semester of 2018.

On 25 October 2016, Brazil’s securities regulator (CVM) ordered GPA to also pay compensation to Globex
Utilidades SA’s other shareholders, in an amount corresponding to 80% of the compensation paid to Morzan
Empreendimentos. Based on a preliminary analysis by GPA, the compensation payable would have amounted
to approximately BRL150 million (€44 million). GPA appealed the CVM’s decision and obtained a stay of
payment of the compensation, estimated at BRL 150 million (€38 million). On 3 October 2017, the CVM”s review
board examined GPA’s appeal and unanimously decided to amend the original decision. Based on the review
board’s final decision, this matter is closed.

- **Class action against Cnova N.V. and the Group**

Some of the officers and directors of Cnova N.V. and the underwriters of its IPO have been named in a class
action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a breach of United
States securities laws. The lawsuit claims that misleading information was issued at the time of the IPO
concerning the macro-economic situation in Brazil and the irregularities uncovered at Cnova Brazil. On
11 October 2017, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York announced its preliminary
approval of the proposed settlement of this class action. In application of the proposed settlement agreement,
a USD 28.5 million (€24 million) compensation fund has been set up (Note 11.1) to settle the claims of the
(former) Cnova shareholders and pay the plaintiffs’ legal fees. A small part of the total amount will be used to
cover the administrative costs involved in managing these payments. Most of the USD 28.5 million has been
put up by Cnova’s insurers. The balance, including the insurance deductible and legal fees, is covered by the
provision set aside by Cnova in its 2016 accounts. Consequently, the settlement should not have any impact on
the Group’s net profit. The debt towards the plaintiffs is reported in “Other liabilities” in the amount of €24 million.
Final approval of the settlement agreement is expected to be issued on 15 March 2018.
In a potential separate case, the SEC could fine Cnova N.V. following an analysis of the facts uncovered during
the internal investigation carried out by Cnova, its lawyers and consultants that was completed at the end of the
first half of 2016.

- **Notification issued by Brazil’s securities regulator (CVM) to Via Varejo and GPA**

On 18 February 2016, Via Varejo received a notification from CVM expressing its disagreement with the
accounting treatment of two transactions carried out in 2013. The first concerned the acquisition by GPA from
Via Varejo of 6.2% of the capital of Nova Pontocom (a transaction that had no impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements) and the second concerned the takeover of Bartira following acquisition of
75% of the shares. GPA and Via Varejo contested the CVM’s interpretation and their position concerning the
Bartira transaction was initially accepted on 26 January 2017. However, on 20 April 2017, CVM confirmed its
original decision regarding Via Varejo and GPA’s accounting treatment of the Bartira transaction. This matter
has no impact on the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2017.

- **Arbitration between GPA and Peninsula**

On 12 September 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro
Peninsula (“Peninsula”) in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related
to leasing agreements concerning stores owned by Peninsula and operated by GPA. The lease contracts have
a duration of 20 years since 2005 and are automatically renewable for another 20 year period.
Casino and GPA management consider that there is no basis to the demands of Peninsula, and are confident
as to the outcome of the arbitration.

- **GPA fiscal, social and civil contingent liabilities**

**(€ millions)** **31 December 2017 31 December 2016**

INSS (employer’s social security contributions) **98** 106

IRPJ – IRRF and CSLL (corporate income taxes) **208** 307

ICMS (state VAT) **1,457** 1,612

Civil litigation **140** 210

**Total [(i)]** **2,371** **2,907**

(i) Contingent liabilities of Via Varejo classified in discontinued operations and not included in the above table amount to
€407 million as at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €433 million).

The €536 million decrease includes the €397 million translation adjustment and €103 million in contingent
liabilities cancelled under the tax amnesty programme.
The tax amnesty programme concerned (i) PIS & COFINS tax on purchases and sales of soya; (ii) the disallowed
PIS & COFINS and IRPJ tax offsets, (iii) other taxes that were previously considered to be potentially due (mainly
the CPMF tax) and (iv) ICMS taxes levied by the São Paulo state tax administration. A net expense of BRL 218
million (€60 million) was recorded upon joining the tax amnesty programmes (see Note 6.5). This amount is
stated net of the taxes waived under the amnesty.

GPA employs consulting firms to advise it in tax disputes, whose fees are contingent on the disputes being
settled in GPA’s favour. As at 31 December 2017, the estimated amount was €40 million (31 December 2016:
€36 million).


-----

Moreover, GPA has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax
adjustments received from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,223 million at 31 December 2017,
interest and penalties included, and for which Casino has committed to indemnify GPA by 50% of the loss that
GPA would incur, provided that the amount is final. Based on the commitment given by Casino to its subsidiary,
the risk exposition amounts to BRL 611 million (€154 million). The underlying risks are considered possible; as
such, no provision was recorded in the accounts.

- **GPA contingent assets**

Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base:

Since the introduction of non-cumulative PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has asserted the right to deduct
ICMS tax from the base used to calculate PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by a Brazilian
federal supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the PIS and
COFINS tax base. Based on the STF’s ruling and the opinion of its internal and external advisors, GPA believes
that the probability of having to settle the amounts deducted in prior periods is low. It has therefore released the
corresponding provisions set up in prior periods for an amount of BRL 117 million (€32 million).
The STF’s ruling has not yet been published and the court has yet to decide on the practical aspects of its
application and the retrospective effects of its decision. GPA and its advisors believe that, once known, these
details will not affect its rights under the proceedings initiated since 2003 and still in progress. However, it is
nevertheless not possible to recognise any tax asset for as long as the proceedings are not closed. Based on a
preliminary estimate, GPA believes that the potential asset represents between BRL 1.3 billion and BRL 1.85
billion (€327 million and €466 million) for continuing operations other than the cash & carry business for which
the estimate has not yet been finalised.

In the case of Via Varejo, which is classified as a discontinued operation, the estimated potential tax asset
amounts to around BRL 1.4 billion (€348 million), including an additional amount of BRL 425 million (€107
million) that will be owed exclusively to GPA.

#### Note 14 Related-party transactions

Related parties are:

- parent companies (mainly Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris);

- entities that exercise joint control or significant influence over the Company;

- subsidiaries (Note 17);

- associates (primarily Mercialys) (Note 3.3);

- joint ventures (Note 3.3);

- members of the Board of Directors and Management Committee (Note 8.4).

and its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice
and assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris
(provision of staff and premises). The expenses recorded during the year in respect of these agreements with
Casino and its subsidiaries totalled €3.7 million, of which €3.2 million for strategic advisory services and €0.5
million for the provision of staff and premises.

The Group recorded a €12 million positive contribution to EBITDA corresponding to the settlement of property
development transactions begun in prior years with Foncière Euris.

In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities,
Casino and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys
(Note 3.3.6).

Related party transactions with individuals (directors, corporate officers and members of their families) are not
material.

Unibanco S.A ("Itaú Unibanco"), GPA, and Via Varejo. They are accounted for by the equity method as GPA exercises significant
influence over their operating and financial policies. Via Varejo’s 14.24% share of FIC’s net assets has been classified as held for sale
in accordance with IFRS 5. BINV is a Via Varejo joint venture and has been classified in full as held for sale.
(iv) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the Via Varejo sub-group.
(v) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the Éxito sub-group. On 27 April 2015, Éxito signed a contractual
agreement, initially with a two-year term, granting it more than 75% of the Disco voting rights and exclusive control over the sub-group's
strategic decisions. On 29 December 2016, the agreement was extended until 30 June 2019. It will then be rolled over automatically until
30 June 2021 unless either party gives notice of its intention to withdraw from the agreement before 31 December 2018.
(vi) Via Varejo’s main subsidiaries and joint ventures are Cnova Comercio Electronico, BINV and Bartira. The entire sub-group has been
classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
(vii) The trust's governance is specified in the agreement between the parties. Éxito is the majority partner and FIC has rights with respect to
certain Viva Malls business decisions concerning such matters as acquisitions and disposals in excess of a certain amount or the method
of setting budgets and business plan targets. The agreement also states that Éxito is the sole provider of property management,
administrative and marketing services for Viva Malls and that it is paid an arm's length fee for these services. A review of the substance
of FIC's rights under the agreement confirms that their effect is solely to protect FIC's investment and that, consequently, Viva Malls is
controlled by Éxito.

#### Note 18 Standards, amendments and interpretations published but not yet mandatory

**Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union as at**
**the reporting date but not yet mandatory**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations,
adopted by the European Union but not mandatory as at 1 January 2017.

**IFRS 9 – Financial instruments**
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments published by the IASB in July 2014 and adopted by the European Union on
29 November 2016, will replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments as from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 defines new
principles covering the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the recognition of impairment
provisions for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting. . Except for hedge accounting, retrospective
application is required but providing comparative information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting, the
requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2018 and does not expect to restate comparative
information, except possibly for the recognition of forward points on foreign currency hedges. The three main
aspects addressed in IFRS 9 were analysed in 2017. This assessment is based on currently available
information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being
made available to the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 9. Overall, the Group expects no significant
impact on its statement of financial position and equity except for the effect of applying the impairment
requirements and, to a lesser extent, the effect of debt modifications. The Group expects an increase in the loss
allowance resulting in a negative impact on equity as discussed below. In addition, the Group will implement
changes in classification of certain financial instruments.

(a) Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities
The standard requires financial assets to be classified as measured at (i) amortised cost, or (ii) fair value through
other comprehensive income or (iii) fair value through profit or loss. The choice of classification is generally
based on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow
characteristics of the financial asset. These classifications replace the categories in IAS 39 (held-to-maturity
investments – a category not used by the Group –, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial
assets). Except for consumer finance receivables and debt modifications, application of the new classifications
is not expected to have any material impact :
   - Credit card receivables are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They will therefore be measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other
comprehensive income will be reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the receivables are
derecognised or reclassified. The main identified impact of this accounting treatment concerns GPA
and, more specifically, its Via Varejo subsidiary which is classified as held for sale.
   - IFRS 9 also modifies the accounting treatment of debt renegotiations that do not lead to derecognition
of the original debt. A renegotiated debt continues to be measured at the original effective interest rate
and the gain or loss resulting from the renegotiation is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Under
IAS 39 the accounting treatment consisted of recognising the interest saving or additional interest cost
resulting from the renegotiation over the remaining life of the renegotiated debt, by prospectively
adjusting its effective interest rate. Under this method, the carrying amount of the debt is not modified
on the renegotiation date.

(b) Impairment of financial assets
IFRS 9 replaces the “incurred loss” model under IAS 39 with the “expected credit loss” model. The new model
is applicable to assets at amortised cost, contract assets, debt instruments at fair value through other
comprehensive income and financial guarantees, but not to investments in equity instruments.
The Group expects to use primarily the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, in particular
related to receivables from franchisees, deferred payment receivables and receivables from rentals.

(c) Hedge accounting
The Group will apply the new general hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9. These include ensuring that
hedging relationships are consistent with its risk management objectives and strategy, and placing greater
emphasis on qualitative and forward-looking tests of hedge effectiveness. The analysis performed by the Group
has confirmed that its current hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
Application of the new hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 is not expected to have any material impact.


-----

In addition to the impacts described above, other adjustments may also have to be made to the accounts upon
adoption of IFRS 9, concerning for example deferred taxes and investments in associates and joint ventures
(such as Banque du Groupe Casino).

**IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers**
On 29 October 2016, the European Union adopted IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which
is applicable as from 1 January 2018. The Group has not elected to early-adopt this standard.
IFRS 15 defines the principles for recognising revenue and will replace the standards IAS 18 – Revenue and
IAS 11 – Construction contracts and all related interpretations. Its scope covers all contracts made with
customers, except for leases (rental and sub-rental revenue), financial instruments (interest income) and
insurance contracts, which are under the scope of other standards.
IFRS 15 defines a unique model for recognising revenue, in five steps. It introduces new concepts and principles
regarding the recognition of revenue, in particular the identification of performance obligations and allocation of
the transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations. It also includes new disclosure
requirements.
The various revenue sources have been analysed in detail and the effects of applying IFRS 15 to revenue
recognition as from 1 January 2018 are expected to be limited given the nature of the Group’s business. The
vast majority of the Group’s revenue originates from sales to final clients made in stores and gas stations; those
sales include no other performance obligations and the related revenue is recognised at checkout.
IFRS 15 will be applied retrospectively to facilitate year-on-year comparisons.

**IFRS 16 – Leases**
The adoption of IFRS 16, which will replace IAS 17 and related interpretations, will affect primarily the accounting
for the operating leases on the Group’s stores and warehouses and will result in the recognition of almost all
leases on-balance sheet. An optional exemption exists for short-term leases and leases on low-value assets.
The standard removes the current distinction between operating and finance leases and requires recognition of
an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability representative of discounted future rentals for
virtually all lease contracts. Operating lease expense will be replaced with interest expense and depreciation,
so key metrics like trading profit and EBITDA will change. The Group believes that consolidated net profit will
also be affected because the total rental expense is generally higher at the beginning of the lease and decreases
over time, unlike a straight-line charge under the current standard. Additionally, net cash from operating activities
will be higher as cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability and the related interest will be
classified as cash flows from financing activities.

The Group is continuing to assess the potential impact on its financial information. As at 31 December 2017,
off-balance sheet non-cancellable operating lease commitments (property and equipment) amounted to €2,726
million (Note 7.2), corresponding mainly to leased store and warehouse properties used in the business. The
assessment of the new standard’s impact is still at any early stage, and the Group has not yet determined to
what the extent operating lease renewal or termination options (particularly the three-yearly right to terminate
commercial leases in France and the possibility to terminate lease arrangements in Brazil in exchange for a
penalty of one to twelve months’ rent) will affect the recognition of an asset and a liability for future minimum
lease payments and how this will affect consolidated profit and the presentation of cash flows.

Finally, the Group has not yet decided the date of first-time adoption of the standard (mandatory application no
later than from 1 January 2019) or the transition method (simplified or full retrospective approach).

**Standards and interpretations not adopted by the European Union as at the**
**reporting date**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations applicable to
the Group which have not yet been adopted by the European Union:

**Standard**

**(application date for the Group subject** **Description of the standard**
**to adoption by the EU)**


IFRS Annual Improvements – 2014-2016 cycle

(1 January 2018)

Amendments to IFRS 2

_Classification and measurement of share-_
_based payments_

(1 January 2018)


The main standard concerned is IFRS 12 – Disclosure of
Interests in Other Entities.
These amendments will be applicable on a retrospective
basis.
They clarify that IFRS 12 also applies to interests in
subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates classified
as “held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 (except for
the requirement to disclose summary financial information
which does not have to be applied).

These amendments will be applicable on a prospective
basis.

The amendments describe the accounting treatment of:

- the effects of vesting conditions and non-vesting
conditions on the measurement of cash-settled sharebased payments: measurement of the liability for cashsettled share-based payments follows the same approach
as used for equity-settled share-based payments;

- share-based payments subject to withholding tax: the
share-based payment is qualified as equity-settled in its
entirety (including the withholding tax) provided that, in
the absence of the withholding tax, the share-based
payment would have been equity-settled in its entirety;

- modifications of share-based payment transactions from
cash-settled to equity-settled: the original liability
recognised in respect of the cash-settled share-based
payment is derecognised and the equity-settled sharebased payment is recognised at the modification date fair
value, with the difference between the two amounts
recognised in profit or loss.


These amendments will be applicable on a prospective
Amendments to IAS 40
basis.

_Transfers of investment property_ These amendments provide guidance on transfers to or
from investment property. They also clarify that the list of
evidence of a change of use is a non-exhaustive list of
(1 January 2018) examples.

Companies will be allowed to apply this interpretation
IFRIC 22
either retrospectively or prospectively.

_Foreign currency transactions and advance_ IFRIC 22 provides guidance on interpreting IAS 21 – The
_consideration_ Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
It clarifies the exchange rate to be used for advance
(1 January 2018) consideration.

**Standard** **Description of the standard**

**(application date for the Group**
**subject to adoption by the EU)**


IFRIC 23

_Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_

(1 January 2019)


Companies will be allowed to apply this interpretation on a
full or partial retrospective basis.
IFRIC 23 explains how to reflect the effects of uncertainty
in accounting for current and deferred tax assets and
liabilities under IAS 12 – Income taxes. It clarifies the
following main points:

 - judgement should be used to determine whether
uncertain tax treatments should be considered separately
or together;

 - an entity should assume that the taxation authority will
examine all amounts reported to it and will have full
knowledge of all relevant information when doing so;

 - the decision whether to recognise current and deferred
tax assets and liabilities should be made based on the
probability (i.e. is it more probable than not) that the asset
will be recovered or the liability will be paid;

 - if it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept
an uncertain tax treatment, the provision should be based
on the estimated amount that the entity expects to pay or
recover, as determined by (i) the most likely amount
method or (ii) a method based on the weighted average
of the various possible scenarios.


These amendments will be applicable on a retrospective
Amendments to IFRS 9
basis.


_Prepayment features with negative_
_compensation_

(1 January 2019)


The amendments expand the classification of financial
assets at amortised cost or at fair value through other
comprehensive income and clarify the application of the
“solely a payment of principal and interest” test to certain
debt instruments with a prepayment feature where the
effect of exercising this clause would reasonably lead to
repayments that are lower than the amount of principal and
interest due.


These amendments will be applicable on a retrospective
Amendments to IAS 28
basis.

These amendments clarify that IFRS 9 (including the

_Long-term interests in associates and joint_ impairment rules) applies to long-term interests in an
_ventures_ associate or joint venture that form part of the net

investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the
(1 January 2019) equity method is not applied.

IFRS Annual Improvements Cycles The main standards concerned are:
2015-2017 cycle  - IAS 12 – Income Taxes: these amendments clarify that
the tax consequences of dividend payments (i.e.

_(1 January 2019)_ distributions of profits) should be recognised in profit or

loss, equity or other comprehensive income according
to where the transactions that generated the distributed
profits were presented. They will be applicable on a
retrospective basis as from the first comparative period
presented.

                      - IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs. These amendments clarify
that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after
the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale,
that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity
borrows generally. These amendments will be
applicable on a prospective basis.

These interpretations and amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the Group's
consolidated financial statements.

|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes "10.1 – Goodwill", "10.2 – Other intangible assets" and "10.5 – Impairment of non-current assets" to the consolidated financial statements”||
|As of December 31, 2017, the net carrying amount of goodwill and brands with an indefinite life recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position, following different business combinations carried out by the Group as part of its external growth transactions, amount to, respectively, €9,031 million and €1,613 million, which represents approximately 28% of total consolidated assets. As part of the valuation of these assets, the Group performs impairment tests at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. We considered the valuation of goodwill and brands, including the goodwill relating to FRANPRIX - LEADER PRICE and the brand relating to EXTRA, to be a key audit matter due to the following: - their materiality in the consolidated financial statements ; - the importance of management’s estimates, assessments and significant assumptions on the basis of which their recoverable amount is determined, based on the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from these assets; - the sensitivity of the valuation of these recoverable amounts to certain assumptions.|We examined the compliance of the methodology implemented by management with the accounting standards in force. We also assessed the main estimates used and analyzed in particular: - the consistency of cash flow projections with the medium-term budgets and business plans prepared by management, as well as the consistency of these projections with the Group’s historical performance and the economic context in which the Group operates, - the methods and parameters used to determine the discount rates applied to estimated cash flows. We recalculated these discount rates, and compared them with the amounts used by leading financial analysts and with our internal databases, with the assistance of our valuation experts, - the relevance of the sensitivity scenarios used by management. Finally, we examined the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, notably those relating to sensitivity tests.|

|Please see Notes "6.2 – Cost of goods sold" and "6.8 – Other current assets" to the consolidated financial statements||
|Within the scope of its retail activities, the Group receives rebates from its suppliers in the form of discounts and commercial cooperation fees. These benefits, generally paid based on a percentage defined contractually, and on purchases made from suppliers, are recorded as a deduction from cost of goods sold. Considering the material impact of these accounting entries on net profit for the period, the large number of contracts concerned and the necessity for management to estimate the purchases covered by these year-end benefits for each supplier, we considered the valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit, we: - examined the internal control measures relating to the process for monitoring these rebates in the Group’s various subsidiaries and carried out tests on the key controls using sampling techniques; - we considered, based on sampling, whether the contractual terms relating to rebates to be received from suppliers were correctly taken into account in the valuation; - we examined the estimates used by management to determine these year- end rebates, in particular the valuation of the level of purchases at year-end used to determine the amounts of the invoices to be issued; - we examined the collection of these receivables subsequent to the year-end date.|

|Within the scope of its retail activities at GPA, the Group recognizes ICMS tax credits. The balance amounts to €382 million as of December 31, 2017, including €201 million related to ICMS ST tax credits from previous fiscal years following a judgment of the Supreme Court in Brazil in April 2017. These tax credits are accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold.|We conducted interviews with various people with responsibilities in the organization of GPA, to identify and understand the process for recognizing tax credits; litigation and existing liabilities, as well as the judgments relating thereto.|


-----

_CASINO,_ _GUICHARD-PERRACHON_

|These tax credits are recognized based on: (i) the interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence, in particular in the retail sector in Brazil, (ii) legal opinions provided by the subsidiary’s external tax advisors, when it is considered that they can be estimated and that their recoverability is probable. Furthermore, as described in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group estimates contingent PIS and COFINS tax credit assets, relating to the exclusion of ICMS from the calculation basis of these two taxes, at an amount within a range of between €327 and €466 million. GPA is also involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in Brazil arising, notably, from tax claims filed by the Brazilian tax authorities. These tax risks, estimated at €2,371 million as of December 31, 2017, have been treated as contingent liabilities and no provisions have been recognized as of December 31, 2017, as indicated in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements. We considered the recognition and recoverability of the tax credits, on the one hand, and the valuation and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities in Brazil, on the other hand, to be key audit matters for the following reasons: (i) the significance in the accounts of the tax credit balance, the contingent asset relating to PIS and COFINS tax credits and the amount of contingent tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, (ii) the complexity of the Brazilian tax legislation regarding taxes and (iii) the use of judgements and estimates by management in connection with the recognition of tax credits and the valuation of contingent tax liabilities.|Concerning tax credits, we examined: - the internal control measures relating to the process for monitoring these tax credits and we tested the related key controls using sampling techniques, - the relevance of the documentation justifying either the recognition of ICMS tax credits over the year, or the qualification of the PIS and COFINS tax credits as a contingent tax asset, - the legal or technical opinions provided by law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the recognition of the tax credits presented in the consolidated financial statements, - the appropriateness of assumptions used by management to draw up the recovery plan underlying the recognized ICMS tax credits. Concerning contingent liabilities, we: - reconciled the list of identified disputes with the information provided by GPA’s main law firms that we contacted, - examined the information on the legal or technical proceedings and/or opinions provided by the law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the appropriateness of the qualification of the various disputes as contingent liabilities, - examined the risk estimates prepared by the Group and reconciled them with the figures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements with respect to contingent tax liabilities. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.|

respect in the notes to the consolidated

**Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the**
**Management Report**

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards
applicable in France the information pertaining to the Group presented in the Board
of Directors’ management report.

|Presentation and valuation of the VIA VAREJO discontinued operations|Col2|
|---|---|
|Risk identified|Our response|
|Please see Notes "2 – Significant events of the year" and "3.5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations" to the consolidated financial statements||
|The process for the sale of the Group’s interest in VIA VAREJO, which represents the entire "Latam Electronics" operating sector and the e-commerce business in Brazil through its subsidiary CNOVA Brazil, undertaken and approved by the Board of Directors on November 23, 2016, is still underway as of December 31, 2017. Following this decision: - the assets and liabilities as well as the cash flow of VIA VAREJO have, respectively, been presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position and of the consolidated statement of cash flows; - the after tax net profit of the VIA VAREJO activities have been presented in a separate line of the consolidated statement of income ("Net profit from discontinued operations"); - VIA VAREJO was valued at the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less selling costs. Considering the significance of the VIA VAREJO activity in the consolidated financial statements (the net assets of VIA VAREJO amount to €1,470 million, or around 11% of net consolidated assets), we considered the accounting classification, the valuation of the interest, and the disclosures provided in this respect in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit, we examined the continuation of the process to sell VIA VAREJO and its subsidiaries undertaken by the Group’s management, with regard to the assessment criteria, set forth in IFRS 5, for the classification of discontinued operations and the resulting presentation. We examined the identification and presentation of all of the items comprising the assets and liabilities, the cash flow statement and the after tax net profit of the VIA VAREJO activities in "Assets held for sale" and "Liabilities associated with assets held for sale" (Note 3.5.1), as well as in profit and cash flow from discontinued operations (Notes 3.5.2 and 3.5.3), with regard to IFRS 5. Concerning these assets and liabilities, we assessed the methods for determining their fair value, less estimated selling costs, as of December 31, 2017, based on, notably, the stock market price at that date. In particular, we considered whether the control premium used by management to estimate the fair value of VIA VAREJO was consistent with comparable transactions that we were able to observe on the Brazilian market. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.|

_CASINO,_ _GUICHARD-PERRACHON_

We have no matters to report as its fair presentation and its consistency with the
consolidated financial statements.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

**_Appointment of the Statutory Auditors_**

We were appointed as statutory auditors of CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON by the
Shareholders ’Meeting held on April 29, 2010.

As at December 31, 2017, our audit firms were both in their 8th year of
uninterrupted engagement. Previously, Ernst & Young Audit had been statutory
auditor since 1978.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for**
**the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal
controls as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.

The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process
and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where
applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting
procedures.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

_CASINO,_ _GUICHARD-PERRACHON_

**Statutory Auditors ’Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated**
**Financial Statements**

**_Objective and audit approach_**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective
is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the_
Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable
in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the
audit and furthermore:

- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to
be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;

- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by
Management in the consolidated financial statements;

- Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to
continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditors conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such
disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed
therein;


-----

_CASINO,_ _GUICHARD-PERRACHON_

- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and
assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;

- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information
of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for
the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated
financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated
financial statements.

**_Report to the Audit Committee_**

We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a
description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well
as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal
control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have
identified.

Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement
that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the
key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in Article 6
of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning
of the rules applicable in France as defined in particular by Articles L.822-10 to
L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French
code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we
discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear
on our independence, and the related safeguards.

The 2016 consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon were approved for publication
by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2017.

#### Note 1 Significant accounting policies

###### 1.1 Accounting standards 

Pursuant to European Commission regulation 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, the consolidated financial
statements of the Casino Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted by the
European Union on the date of approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors and applicable
at 31 December 2016.

These standards are available on the European Commission's website
(http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm).

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in all periods presented, after taking
account of the new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations listed below.

These amendments to existing standards and interpretations had no material impact on the Group's financial
performance or position.

**New standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations adopted by the**
**European Union and mandatory as from the financial year beginning on 1** **January 2016**

The European Union has adopted the following standards, amendments to existing standards and
interpretations that are applicable in the case of the Group as from the financial year beginning on
1 January 2016. These new standards, amendments and interpretations presented below which are
applicable by the Group do not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and are to be
applied on a prospective basis unless otherwise indicated.

- Annual Improvements to IFRSs - 2010-2012 Cycle, concerning in particular the following standards:

    - IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment
_These amendments provide a clearer definition of "vesting conditions" by separately defining_
_"performance condition" and "service condition"._

    - IFRS 3 –Business Combinations:
_These amendments clarify that changes in the fair value of contingent consideration which are not_
_adjustments in the measurement period are to be recognised in profit or loss._

    - IFRS 8 - Operating Segments
_These amendments are applicable on a retrospective basis. They require entities to disclose in the_
_notes to the financial statements the judgements made by Management in applying the aggregation_
_criteria to operating segments._


-----

    - IAS 24 - Related Party Disclosures
_These amendments are applicable on a retrospective basis. They clarify that are included among_
_related parties entities, the case of an entity providing key management personnel services to the_
_reporting entity or to the parent of a reporting entity. In this case, the reporting entity is not required_
_to provide details of the compensation it pays to key management personnel pursuant to IAS 24.17,_
_but must indicate the amount of fees paid to the entity that provides the service._

- Amendments to IAS 1 - Disclosure Initiative
_These amendments clarify requirements in two areas:_
    - applying the materiality concept: the amendment states that materiality applies to the whole
financial statements including the accompanying notes, and that including information that is not
material can obscure useful information;
    - applying professional judgement: the amendment makes minor changes to certain prescriptive
language that is perceived as impeding the exercise of judgements.

###### 1.2 Basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements 

**1.2.1 Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, with the
exception of the following:

- assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, which are measured at fair value in
accordance with IFRS 3;

- derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets, which are measured at fair value.
The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities hedged by a fair value hedge which would otherwise be
measured at cost are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros. The figures in the tables have been
rounded to the nearest million euros and include individually rounded data. Consequently, the totals and
sub-totals shown may not correspond exactly to the sum of the reported amounts.

**1.2.2 Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expenses, as
well as the disclosures made in certain notes to the consolidated financial statements. Due to the inherent
uncertainty of assumptions, actual results may differ from the estimates. Estimates and assessments are
reviewed at regular intervals and adjusted where necessary to take into account past experience and any
relevant economic factors.

The main judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the information available when the financial
statements are drawn up and concern the following:

  - classification and measurement of Via Varejo's net assets in accordance with IFRS 5 (note 3.5);

  - assessment of the control exercised over Viva Malls in Colombia (note 3.1.7);

  - impairment of non-current assets and goodwill (note 10.5);

  - recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets (note 9);

  - provisions for risks –particularly tax and employee-related risks –and recognition and
measurement of the recoverable amount of tax credits ( VAT or similar) (notes 5.1 and 13).

#### Note 2 Significant events of the year

Significant events of the year included:

  - **Disposal of operations in Thailand and Vietnam in first-half 2016**
The Group's operations in Thailand and Vietnam were sold during the first half of 2016 as part of the
deleveraging plan announced in late 2015 (note 3.1.1).

  - **Rating downgrade**
On 21 March 2016, Standard & Poor's announced the downgrade of Casino's rating from BBB- to BB+
outlook stable. The downgrade followed Standard & Poor's announcement on 15 January 2016 that it was
placing the BBB- rating under CreditWatch in the context of the Group’s problems in emerging markets and
notably Brazilian recession.
The rating downgrade resulted in a 125-bps step-up in the annual coupon paid on the Group's bonds,
applicable for each bond as from the first annual interest period beginning after 21 March 2016. This clause
added €15 million to finance costs for 2016. The 2017 increase is estimated at €63 million, taking into
account the bonds bought back in 2016 (see below). Casino debt documentation does not include any
rating-based acceleration clause and there is no covenant related to Casino’s rating.

On 14 December 2016, Fitch Ratings changed the outlook for Casino's BBB- rating to negative. This change
has no financial impact for the Group.

  - **Exercise of the call option on Monoprix mandatory convertible bonds**
On 3 May 2016, Casino exercised its call option on all of the mandatory convertible bonds issued by
Monoprix in December 2013 and subscribed by Crédit Agricole CIB. The transaction took place on
10 May 2016 at a strike price of €508 million (€500 million nominal value and €8 million interest), leading to
the recognition of financial income of €13 million under "Net finance costs" and to a €502million reduction in
equity (with €419 million deducted from non-controlling interests and €83 million from equity attributable to
owners of the parent).

  - **Financial agreement with the Baud family and acquisition of control of Geimex**
On 25 May 2016, Casino and the Baud family came to a financial agreement to end their legal dispute that
had been ongoing since 2007. Pursuant to this agreement and after approval of France's anti-trust
authorities, on 18 October 2016 the Casino Group acquired the Baud family's 50% stake in Geimex, owner
of international rights to the Leader Price brand and previously jointly owned by both parties, for €45 million
excluding transaction costs (note 3.1.6).

  - **Bond buybacks**
The following buyback offers were launched in 2016 for bonds representing a total nominal amount of
€978 million:
- Two offers were launched in June and September 2016 for bonds due in August 2019, January 2023,
February 2025 and August 2026. A total of €871 million worth of bonds were tendered to these offers
and were bought back and cancelled on 15 June and 30 September 2016, respectively.
- During the first half of the year, the Group also purchased on the market €108 million worth of bonds
included in these issues (€13 million due in January 2023, €42 million due in February 2025 and
€53 million due in August 2026).

The impact on the consolidated financial statements was as follows:
- Decrease in gross financial debt, including fair value hedges component: €1,015 million (note 11.2.1);
- Decrease in hedging instruments with a positive fair value: €37 million (note 11.2.1);
- Recognition in "Finance costs, net" of a €33 million pre-tax gain (before taking into account future
savings in interest) (note 11.3.1).


-----

  - **Interim dividend**
On 30 November 2016, the Company paid an interim dividend of €171 million (note 12.9).

  - **Creation of two non-food central purchasing organisations with the Conforama Group**
On 19 September 2016, Casino and Conforama announced the creation of a joint non-food central
purchasing organisation named Mano, to optimise their respective purchases in France.
Shortly afterwards, on 30 November 2016, the two groups announced the creation of an international
purchasing organisation named SICA that will include also other brands of Steinhoff International group.
The two organisations will be up and running by the time the 2017 commercial negotiations begin. The
impact of the Group's investment in these new companies on the 2016 consolidated statement of financial
position and income statement was not material.

  - **Planned disposal of Via Varejo**
On 23 November 2016, the Group announced that it had approved GPA's decision to start negotiations for
the sale of its investment in Via Varejo. The transaction’s scope is the whole of the Latam Electronics
operating segment including Cnova Brazil which operates the e-commerce business in Brazil. Following this
decision, in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations:
   - The assets and liabilities held for sale have been reclassified in the consolidated statement of
financial position under "Assets held for sale" for €6,039 million and "Liabilities associated with assets
held for sale" for €4,404 million. The €1,635 million net asset value at 31 December 2016 includes an
impairment loss of €461 million recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the disposal group to its
fair value less costs to sell, as estimated by reference to the stock-exchange price at the year-end
(note 3.5.2).
   - Via Varejo's 2016 net profit is reported in the consolidated income statement under "Net profit from
discontinued operations", net of the impairment loss referred to above.
   - The consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December
2015 have been restated on the same basis (note 3.5).
   - The tables included in operating lease commitments and contingent liabilities notes (respectively note
7.3 and note 13.3) do not take into account Via Varejo activities for the year 2016. If necessary,
specific information for Via Varejo was given in a footnote.

  - **Reorganisation of the e-commerce business and launch of a cash tender offer for Cnova**
**N.V. ordinary shares**
On 6 December 2016, the Company launched a voluntary tender offer on the U.S. market and Euronext for
all of the outstanding Cnova N.V. shares not already held, at a price of USD 5.5 per share. The Group
companies that hold Cnova N.V. shares did not participate in the offer, which therefore applied to 10.37% of
the 344.5 million outstanding shares, representing a maximum potential investment of USD 197 million. An
amount of €219 million was placed in escrow as a guarantee for the Company's obligations under the offer
(note 11.1).

The impact on the consolidated financial statements included recognition of a €187 million financial liability
under "Current put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests" and a corresponding adjustment to
equity (note 3.4.1). This liability corresponded to the euro-equivalent value at 31 December 2016 of the
maximum potential amount payable for shares tendered to the offer. The offer costs, in the amount of €6
million net of tax, were recorded as a deduction from equity.
On 31 January 2017, the Group announced final results of the tender offer and that it had acquired 31.7
million shares, representing 9.2% of Cnova N.V.'s capital for €163 million. Following this operation, the
Group now holds 98.88% of Cnova N.V.'s capital and 99.41% of the voting rights, leaving a free float of
1.12% of the capital and 0.59% of the voting rights.

The offer followed the business merger on 31 October 2016 between Cnova Brazil and Via Varejo, and Via
Varejo's subsequent acquisition of the entire capital of Cnova Brazil from Cnova N.V. in exchange for its own
interest in Cnova N.V. and €12 million in cash. The recovered shares were considered as cancelled by
Cnova N.V. on 31 December 2016. The reorganisation diluted the Casino Group's interest in Cnova Brazil
from 55.35% to 14.38%. Its impact on the consolidated financial statements included a €44 million increase
in equity attributable to owners of the parent and a corresponding decrease in non-controlling interests to
reflect the changes in the percentage interests in Cnova N.V. and Cnova Brazil, and the recognition in the
income statement, under "Profit from discontinued operations", of- €25 million in costs and tax effects related
to the reorganisation.

#### Note 3 Scope of consolidation


-----

Acquisition-related costs are recognised in "Other operating expenses", except for those related to
the issue of equity instruments.
Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each
business combination, the Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case,
the amount of goodwill is limited to the portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method.
Under the full goodwill method, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value and goodwill is
recognised on the full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial
goodwill method, the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3.

In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is
remeasured at fair value as at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and
carrying amount of the previously-held interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under "Other
operating income" or "Other operating expenses").
The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the
information needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new
information obtained by the buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted after the measurement period (not exceeding 12
months from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent acquisitions of non-controlling
interests do not give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill.

Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair
value, whatever the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
contingent consideration due to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are
recorded by adjusting goodwill if they occur during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss
for the period under "Other operating income" or "Other operating expenses" if they arise after the
measurement period, unless the obligation is settled in equity instruments. In that case, the
contingent consideration is not remeasured subsequently.

Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies

In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of
shares in consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the
following principle:
  - the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is
eliminated in full from the accounts of the acquirer;

  - non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a
corresponding adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total
equity.

Foreign currency translation

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the
Group's parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their
financial transactions are measured in that currency.

The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent
company are translated using the closing rate method, as follows:

- assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments,are translated into euros at
the closing rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date;

- income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the
period unless significant variances occur.

The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on
translation of the net investment in the operation concerned at successive reporting dates are
reclassified to profit or loss. Because the Group applies the step-by-step method of consolidation, the
cumulative translation differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if the foreign operation disposed
is part of a sub-group. This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the sub-group.

###### 3.1 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2016

**3.1.1 Disposal of operations in Asia**

  - **Disposal of operations in Thailand**
On 14 January 2016, the Group announced its intention to sell its stake in its subsidiary Big C Supercenter
PCL ("Big C"), a company listed in Thailand. Big C was sold on 21 March 2016 to BJC, a TCC group
subsidiary. The proceeds from the sale amounted to €3,066 million net of disposal costs, generating an
after-tax gain of €2,314 million (note 3.5).
As part of the transaction, Cnova sold its economic interests in Cdiscount Thailand to the BJC group for
€28 million net of disposal costs (including repayment of a €6 million loan), realising an after-tax gain of
€27 million (note 3.5).

  - **Disposal of operations in Vietnam**
On 29 April 2016, the Group announced that it had sold Big C Vietnam to the Central group for an enterprise
value of €1 billion. As the decision to dispose of operations in Vietnam was made before the end of 2015,
the assets and liabilities of the E-commerce and Retail businesses in Vietnam were classified as held for
sale at 31 December 2015. The proceeds amounted to €875 million net of disposal costs, generating an
after-tax gain of €524 million (note 3.5).

Following the disposal of its operations in Thailand and Vietnam, representing the entire "Asia" operating
segment and part of the "E-commerce" operating segment, the Group has presented the net after-tax profit
of its Thai and Vietnamese operations as well as the capital gain on the disposal of these businesses on a
separate line of the income statement ("Net profit from discontinued operations"),.

The consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2015 has been restated in order to
present discontinued operations separately from continuing operations (notes 1.3 and 3.5).

**3.1.2 Acquisition of Éxito shares**

Between 1 March and 28 March 2016, the Group acquired 2.4 million shares in its subsidiary Éxito for a total
of USD 11 million (€10 million) (note 4.3), increasing its stake in the company to 55.30% from 54.77%
previously. These transactions had a €6 million positive impact on equity attributable to owners of the parent
and a €17 million negative impact on non-controlling interests.

**3.1.3 Acquisition of GPA shares**

In June 2016, the Group acquired 970 thousand preference shares, representing approximately 0.4% of
GPA's capital, for €11 million (note 4.3). These transactions had a €6 million positive impact on equity
attributable to owners of the parent and a €17 million negative impact on non-controlling interests.


-----

**3.1.4 Changes in scope relating to Franprix-Leader Price subgroup**

As part of the continuation of the franchisee redeployment projects at Franprix-Leader Price, the subsidiary
sold a group of Franprix and Leader Price stores to two master franchisees during the year that were lossmaking under the integrated management mode. The Group sold a 51% interest in the stores, generating a €61 million net loss recognised in "Other operating expenses" (note 6.5). If the transactions had been
completed on 1 January 2016, (i) net sales for the year would have been reduced by €33 million, (ii) trading
profit would have been increased by €13 million, (iii) other operating expenses would have been increased
by €9 million (comprising impairment losses of €4.5 million and a €4.5 million revaluation of the retained
interest) and (iv) the Group's share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted investees would have been reduced
by €6 million.
In addition, Franprix-Leader Price has various call options on the stores (note 3.4.2).

At the same time, the same master franchisees acquired a 49% interest in a group of profit-making Franprix
and Leader Price stores. These disposals, without loss of control, had no material impact on equity
attributable to owners of the parent.

Furthermore, Franprix-Leader Price also acquired controlling interests in various groups during the year. The
amounts disbursed for these acquisitions totalled €32 million and generated provisional goodwill of
€35 million. Since the sub-groups acquired were previously equity-accounted in the Casino Group's
consolidated financial statements, the remeasurement of the interests previously-held generated a €3 million
gain.
The contribution of these groups to consolidated net sales and pre-tax profit for the period from the
acquisition date to the 2016 year-end amounted to €23 million and -€11 million, respectively.
If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2016, net sales for the year would have been increased
by €16 million and pre-tax profit would have been reduced by €1 million.

**3.1.5 Loss of control of a group of Casino supermarkets**

In line with its franchisee redeployment strategy, during the second half of 2016 Distribution Casino France
sold a 51% stake in a group of 12 Casino supermarkets that were loss-making under the integrated
management system to a master franchisee. The net loss on the sale amounted to €34 million and was
recorded in "Other operating expenses" (note 6.5). If the transaction had been completed on
1 January 2016, (i) net sales for the year would have been reduced by €14 million, (ii) trading profit would
have been increased by €9 million, (iii) other operating expense would have been increased by €1 million
and the Group's share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted investees would have been reduced by €3 million.
Distribution Casino France has a call option on the group of stores that is exercisable in 2019 (note 3.4.2).

**3.1.6 Acquisition of control of Geimex**

Following signature of a settlement agreement, the Group acquired control of Geimex (note 2). Geimex was
previously jointly controlled and was accounted for by the equity method on a 50% basis in the Group
accounts until 31 October 2016. The purchase price amounts to €45 million, leading to the recognition of
provisional goodwill of €69 million. The transaction costs amount to €1 million.
The change in accounting method from the equity method at 50% to full consolidation resulted in the
recognition, in accordance with IFRS 3, of a €16 million gain from re-measurement of previously-held
interest which was recognised in "Other operating income".
Geimex's contribution to consolidated net sales and consolidated net profit for the period from 31 October to
31 December 2016 amounted to €25 million and €1 million respectively (excluding the gain from remeasurement at fair value of the previously-held interest). If control of Geimex had been acquired on 1
January 2016, it would have added €148 million to net sales and €1 million to consolidated net profit.


-----

**3.1.7 Creation of the Viva Malls real estate trust in Colombia**

On 15 July 2016, Éxito created a Colombian real estate trust named Viva Malls to hold all of the Viva brand
shopping centres and malls. On 22 December 2016, Éxito and Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia (FIC), a private
equity fund managed by Fiduciara Bancolombia, signed an agreement providing for the acquisition by FIC of
a 49% stake in the trust's capital. FIC's total capital commitment amounts to COP 773 billion (€245 million),
of which €124 million excluding expenses had been paid as of 31 December 2016 and €121 million will be
paid over the next 18 months. FIC's stake in Viva Malls was based on the total value attributed to the trust's
real estate assets of COP 1,600 billion (€506 million). Following this transaction, Éxito owns 51% of Viva
Malls.

The trust's governance is specified in the agreement between the parties. Éxito is the majority partner and
FIC has rights with respect to certain business decisions concerning such matters as acquisitions and
disposals in excess of a certain amount or the method of setting budgets and business plan targets. The
agreement also states that Éxito is the sole provider of property management, administrative and marketing
services for Viva Malls and that it is paid an arm's length fee for these services. A review of the substance of
FIC's rights under the agreement confirms that their effect is solely to protect FIC's investment and that,
consequently, Viva Malls is controlled by Éxito.

The transaction has been accounted for as a transaction between shareholders, leading to a €3 million
reduction in equity attributable to owners of the parent (including -€6 million in costs) and a €115 million
increase in non-controlling interests (net of -€5 million in costs)

###### 3.2 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2015

**3.2.1 Acquisition of control of the Uruguayan subsidiary Disco**

The Disco subgroup in Uruguay was previously jointly controlled by the Group through its subsidiary Éxito
which held a 62.49% stake. This subgroup was therefore accounted for using the equity method until
31 December 2014. Following the signing of a contractual agreement, initially with a two-year term, granting
it more than 75% of the voting rights and exclusive control over strategic decisions, Éxito acquired control of
the Disco subgroup with effect from 1 January 2015. On 29 December 2016, the agreement was extended
until 30 June 2019. It will then be rolled over automatically until 30 June 2021 unless either party gives
notice of its intention to withdraw from the agreement before 31 December 2018.

The change in accounting method from the equity method at 62.49% (percentage of Éxito’s holding) to full
consolidation (no change in the percentage of interest) resulted in the recognition of a €262 million gain from
the re-measurement of the interest previously held which was recognised under “Other operating income”
(see note 6.5).

The measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value resulted in the recognition of €304 million
in goodwill that was allocated to the Uruguay CGU. There were no changes in fair value at 1 January 2016.

The Disco subgroup's contribution to consolidated net sales and consolidated net profit (excluding the gain
from re-measurement at fair value of the previously-held interest) for the period from 1 January to
31 December 2015 amounted to €436 and €33 million respectively. The costs related to the acquisition of
control were not material.

Furthermore, the Group has granted a put option on 29.8% of Disco's capital to the family shareholders. The
option is exercisable until 21 June 2021. The exercise price is based on Disco's average consolidated
EBITDA or net profit for the previous two years and the subgroup's net debt, with a floor price of USD 41
million plus interest of 5% p.a. The put option is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial
position for an amount of €115 million at 31 December 2016 (note 3.4.1) (31 December 2015: €90 million).

**3.2.2 Exercise of the call option on Super Inter stores**

On 15 April 2015, Éxito exercised a call option that enabled it to acquire 29 Super Inter stores operated by
Éxito since October 2014, as well as the Super Inter brand. The acquisition price was COP 343,920 million
(€124 million) of which COP 284,173 million (€99 million) had been paid as of 31 December 2015. There
was no change in the fair value of the assets and liabilities between 2015 and the date when the call option
was exercised, on 15 April 2016. Goodwill recognized on the acquisition amounted to €95 million.


-----

**3.2.3 Changes in scope concerning the Franprix-Leader Price subgroup**

In 2015, Franprix – Leader Price acquired control of various subgroups. The total purchase price paid was
€53 million, generating goodwill of €55 million.

If these acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2015, net sales would have been increased by
€66 million and pre-tax profit would have been reduced by €3 million.

Furthermore, as part of its franchisee redeployment project, during 2015 Franprix-Leader Price sold a 51%
stake in a group of Franprix and Leader Price stores that were loss-making under the integrated
management system to two master franchisees. The net loss on the sales amounted to €58 million and was
recorded in "Other operating expenses".
If these disposals had been carried out on 1 January 2015, net sales would have been reduced by €51
million and there would have been no impact on pre-tax profit.
At the same time, the two master franchisees acquired a 49% interest in a group of profit-making Franprix
and Leader Price stores. These disposals without loss of control reduced equity attributable to owners of the
parent by €52 million and increased non-controlling interests by the same amount.

**3.2.4 Asset exchange agreement between Éxito and Cafam**

On 23 February 2015, Éxito and La Caja de Compensación Familiar –CAFAM entered into an agreement
providing for:

    - The acquisition by Éxito of stores owned by Cafam but operated by Éxito since September 2010.
The acquisition price paid was €44 million, generating an equivalent amount of deductible goodwill.

    - The sale to Cafam of drugstores owned by Éxito, some of which had been operated by Cafam
since September 2010, for a total of €27 million recognised under "Other operating income".

    - Termination of the operating contract that had been signed in September 2010.

The costs related to the acquisition of control of the stores were not material.

**3.2.5 Acquisition of non-controlling interests in Lanin**

On 26 February 2015, following the exercise of put options, the Group acquired all the non-controlling
interests in Lanin (3.18%), a holding company that owns all the shares in Devoto, an operator of stores in
Uruguay. The amount disbursed for this acquisition was €17 million (note 4.3).

**3.2.6 Creation of SCI Simonop'1 and entrance to the capital of investors**

In October 2015, Monoprix and two of its subsidiaries created SCI Simonop'1. Subsequently, on 22
December 2015, Monoprix and its two subsidiaries transferred to SCI Simonop'1 eleven property assets
housing Monoprix supermarkets valued at €138 million. On the same date, 49% of Simonop'1 shares were
sold to three property investment companies managed by Ciloger for a total price of €73 million (note 4.3).
The transaction had the effect of increasing consolidated equity by €72 million (including a €4 million
increase in equity attributable to owners of the parent).

(i) As at 31 December 2016, the Group held 40.22% of the capital of Mercialys. The Group considers that it exercises
significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the Mercialys Group. This position is based on an
analysis of the votes cast at recent Shareholders General Meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related
parties do not control shareholder decisions at General Meetings), the absence of a majority vote on strategic
decisions at meetings of the company's Board of Directors, which is mostly made up of independent directors, and the
governance rules stipulating that Casino's representatives on the Mercialys Board may not take part in decisions
concerning transactions carried out with the Group and business contracts entered into between the Group and
Mercialys on an arm's length basis.
(ii) The main associate of the GPA subgroup is FIC which was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco
S.A. (Itaú Unibanco) to finance purchases of GPA's customers. Associates of the GPA subgroup are accounted for
using the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over their operating and financial policies. The data
presented above only concern FIC as the other associates are not material.
(iii) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of FIC, where it corresponds to the
interest held by the GPA subgroup.
(iv) The current assets and liabilities of Banque du Groupe Casino and FIC primarily concern their consumer finance
business.
(v) Corresponding to the reserve allocated to Itaú Unibanco in FIC's bylaws that is deducted for the purpose of
determining the value of the Group's investment in FIC.

**3.3.2 Other investments in associates and joint ventures**

At 31 December 2016, the carrying amounts of investments in other associates and joint ventures stood at
€41 million and €41 million, respectively (note 3.3.3). The aggregate amounts of key financial statement
items for these associates and joint ventures are not material. Dividends received from these associates and
joint ventures amounted to €2 million in 2016 (2015: €26 million).

**3.3.4 Impairment losses on investments in equity-accounted investees**

With the exception of Mercialys, associates and joint ventures are privately-held companies for which no
quoted market prices are available to estimate their fair value.
The fair value of the investment in Mercialys at the reporting date was €712 million, determined using the
market price on 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: €691 million). This value does not reflect any
impairment. Mercialys' EPRA NNNAV at 31 December 2016 amounted to €1,861 million on a 100% basis.
The impairment tests carried out at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 did not result in the
recognition of any impairment loss.


-----

**3.3.5 Share of contingent liabilities of equity-accounted investees**

As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, none of the Group's associates and joint ventures had
any material contingent liabilities.

**3.3.6 Related party transactions (equity-accounted investees)**

The related party transactions shown below mainly concern transactions carried out in the normal course of
business on arm's length terms with companies over which the Group exercises significant influence
(associates) or joint control (joint ventures) that are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements
using the equity method.

property assets amounted to €117 million, including €60 million due within one year.
(ii) Of which income related to property development transactions with Mercialys reported in "Other revenue" for €77

for an amount of €577 and €132 million respectively in 2016 and 2015 Franprix – Leader Price sales of goods to
equity-accounted master franchisees.

**Transactions with Mercialys**

Casino has entered into various agreements with Mercialys:
- Leases: Casino leases units in certain shopping centres from Mercialys, for which the rent is included in
the above table.
- Asset management agreement: Casino provides rental management services for nearly all Mercialys
properties. In 2016, the related management fees amounted to €6 million (2015: €5 million).
- Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 June 2012 and
an addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership's fundamental principle whereby
Casino develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth
has been maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects
identified in advance and offering satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to
propose new projects that will be examined by Casino and tracked during monitoring committee
meetings.
Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary
permits have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of
projected rental revenues or signed leases.
The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on
the basis of (i) a rent capitalization rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by
reference to the rates used to value Mercialys' portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the
project. Under the new agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to
10% – may also be taken into account for pricing purposes.
The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has
been maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed. For
example, the price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside)
difference between the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at
the outset. The contracts require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process.
In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that
could lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group's food
stores.
Mercialys has extended the partnership agreement with Casino for a further three years, until end-2020.
- Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, accounting, IT and real estate support
services to Mercialys. In 2016, the related fees amounted to €2 million (2015: €2 million).


-----

- Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real
estate portfolio enhancement specialists. This agreement had no material impact in 2016 or 2015.
- Exclusive sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. In 2016, the
related fees amounted to €1 million (2015: €2 million).
- Current account and cash management agreement: Casino has provided Mercialys with a €50 million
confirmed line of credit expiring in December 2019 at an annual interest rate based on the Euribor plus
a spread ranging from 40 bps to 95 bps depending on the amount borrowed under the facility. The
Group also charges a 38-bps commitment fee (40% of the maximum 95-bps spread) on undrawn
amounts. This agreement had no material impact in 2016 or 2015.

Under the partnership agreement between Casino and Mercialys and in line with the asset sales carried out
in 2014 and 2015, during 2016 Casino sold property development projects (including two Monoprix sites) to
Mercialys for a total of €77 million. Based on each project's percentage of completion, the sale led to the
recognition of €62 million in "Other income" and a €29 million positive contribution to EBITDA after
eliminating a portion corresponding to the Group's percentage interest in Mercialys.

Mercialys also entered into an agreement with OPPCI SEREIT France under which it transferred to SCI
Rennes – Anglet the buildings housing two hypermarkets, a shopping mall and a mid-sized store that were
developed by Casino and sold to Mercialys in 2014. SCI Rennes – Anglet is 30%-owned by Mercialys and
70% by OPPCI SEREIT France. The transaction led to the recognition in "Other income" of €15 million –
corresponding to the additional fraction of 70% of the property development profit that had previously been
eliminated on a 40% basis – and to an €11 million contribution to EBITDA.
The Group also has a call option exercisable on 31 July 2018, at its initiative and subject to certain
conditions, on either (i) the property assets held by SCI Rennes – Anglet, valued at a fixed price of
€64 million or (ii) the SCI Rennes – Anglet shares held by OPPCI SEREIT France, valued at the company's
market value (NAV), based on the property portfolio's appraisal value of €64 million excluding transfer costs.

**Transactions with other related parties**

In connection with its property trading business, on 21 December 2016 the Group sold a portfolio of ten
Leader-Price store premises to a master franchisee for €53 million recorded in "Other income" generating a
positive contribution in EBITDA of €5 million.

**3.3.7 Commitments to joint ventures**

As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, there were no material commitments to joint ventures.


-----

###### 3.4 Commitments related to the scope of consolidation

**3.4.1 Put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests - "PUTs options"**

**Accounting principle**

The Group has granted put options to the owners of non-controlling interests in some of its subsidiaries.
The exercise price may be fixed or based on a predetermined formula. In accordance with IAS 32,
obligations under these PUTs options on non-controlling interests in fully consolidated subsidiaries are
recognised as ”financial liabilities”; fixed price options are recognised at their discounted present value
and variable price options at fair value ; furthermore, these options may be exercisable at any time or on a
specified date. Since 2015, PUTs options are presented on a separate line of the consolidated statement
of financial position, "Put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests".

IAS 27 revised, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, and
subsequently IFRS 10, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, describe the
accounting treatment of acquisitions of additional shares in subsidiaries. The Group has decided to apply
two different accounting methods for these PUTs options, depending on whether they were granted before
or after the effective date of IAS 27 revised, as recommended by France's securities regulator (Autorité
des marchés financiers):

    - PUTs options granted before the effective date of IAS 27 revised are accounted for using the
goodwill method whereby the difference between the PUTs options liability and the carrying
amount of the non-controlling interests is recognised in goodwill. In subsequent years, this
liability is remeasured and any changes adjust goodwill.

    - PUTs options granted since IAS 27 revised came into effect are accounted for as transactions
between shareholders, with the difference between the PUTs options liability and the carrying
amount of the non-controlling interests recognised as a deduction from equity. In subsequent
years, this liability is remeasured and any changes adjust equity.

PUTs options can be analysed as follows at 31 December 2016:

**Total PUTs options liabilities** **41** **341**

(i) The exercise price of these put options on non-controlling interests in subsidiaries of the Franprix-Leader Price
subgroup is generally based on net profit. A 10% increase or decrease in the indicator would not have a material
impact. The options expire between 2016 and 2031.
(ii) Option exercisable until 21 June 2021.
(iii) Concerns the public tender offer for Cnova N.V. shares (note 2).
(iv) As at 31 December 2015, PUTs options liabilities amounted to €151 million, of which current liabilities of €102 million.
The increase in 2016 was mainly due to the public tender offer for Cnova N.V. shares (note 2) for €187 million.


-----

**3.4.2 Off-balance sheet commitments**

**Accounting principle**

Under the terms of the option contracts, the exercise price of written put and call options may be
determined using earnings multiples of the companies concerned. In this case, the options are valued
based on the latest published earnings for options exercisable at any time and earnings forecasts or
projections for options exercisable as of a given future date. In many cases, the put option written by the
Group is matched by a call option written by the other party ; in these cases, the value shown corresponds
to that of the written put.

PUTs options on non-controlled companies stood at €5 million as at 31 December 2016 (31 December
2015: €19 million), and concerned the Franprix – Leader Price subgroup exclusively.

The Group has been granted the following call options in connection with transactions carried out with
Mercialys:

- call option on 100% of the assets or 100% of the shares of Hyperthetis Participations, exercisable
between 30 September 2020 and 31 March 2022 at the higher of the fair value of the underlying and a
guaranteed minimum IRR;

- call option on a property asset previously sold to Immosiris, exercisable between 31 March 2021 and
30 September 2022 at the higher of the fair value of the underlying and a guaranteed minimum IRR;

- call option exercisable on 31 July 2018, at its initiative and subject to certain conditions, on either (i) the
property assets held by SCI Rennes –Anglet, valued at a fixed price of €64 million or (ii) the SCI Rennes
Anglet shares held by OPPCI SEREIT France, valued at the company's market value (NAV), based on –
the property portfolio's appraisal value of €64 million excluding transfer costs.

Lastly, in connection with the transactions carried out with master franchisees describe in notes 3.1.4 and
3.1.5, the Group has call options on stores that are exercisable between 2019 and 2022 at prices based on
a percentage of the improvement in EBITDA.

The total value of these call options was €423 million as at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: €311
million).


-----

###### 3.5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.

**Accounting principle**

Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset or disposal group is classified
as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than
through continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset or disposal group must be available for
immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management must be
committed to a plan to sell the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion of a sale
within one year of the date of this classification. Considering these caracteristics, net assets held for sale
attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction from net debt
(note 11).

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated
or amortised.

A discontinued operation is either a component of an entity that has been disposed of or operation that is
classified as held for sale and:

 - represents a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is part of a
single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations, or

 - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

An operation represents a separate major line of business when it constitutes a reportable segment. It is
classed as discontinued if the criteria for classifying the related assets as "held for sale" have been met or
when it has already been disposed of. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when the
operation is disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for sale.

When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of
cash flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as
from the first day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of
the consolidated income statement, "Profit from discontinued operations", which includes the net profit or
loss of the discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment loss
recognised to write down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or any aftertax disposal gains or losses.

(i) Mainly corresponding to the two months of business up to the date of disposal of operations in Thailand on
21 March 2016, the four months of business up to the date of disposal of operations in Vietnam on 29 April 2016
and 12 months of business for Via Varejo.
(ii) Via Varejo reported EBITDA and trading profit amount to €251 million and of €184 million respectively in 2016.
(iii) The fair value of Via Varejo (including Cnova Brazil) is estimated at €1,656 million (before estimated costs to sell
of €20 million), based on the share price of BRL 10.75 as at 31 December 2016 plus an estimated control
premium. This value was confirmed by an independent valuation performed by the banks retained by the Group to
assist with the sale process.
This value is classified in level 3 hierarchy. The 20% increase or decrease in the estimated fair value would
reduce or increase the impairment loss by €295 million (at constant exchange rates).

Earnings per share of discontinued operations are presented in note 12.10.

**3.5.3 Irregularities at the Cnova Brazil subsidiary**

Investigations into the irregularities were completed in June 2016 and an additional net loss of €35
million was recorded under "Profit from discontinued operations" following the Group's decision to
dispose of Via Varejo. The net loss mainly comprised €16 million of impairment on intangible assets, €10
million in cut-off adjustments and €5 million of scrapped tangible assets. The Group considers that the
portion of adjustments corresponding to corrections of prior year errors were not sufficiently material to
justify restating previously published financial statements.

#### Note 4 Additional disclosures related to the consolidated statement of cash flows

**Accounting principle**

The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method starting from consolidated profit
(loss) before tax and is organised in three sections:

     - Cash flows from operating activities, including taxes, transaction costs for acquisitions of
control, dividends received from associates and joint ventures and payments received in
respect of government grants.

     - Cash flows from investing activities, including acquisitions of control (excluding acquisition
costs), losses of control including transaction costs, acquisitions and disposals of investments
in non-consolidated companies and of associates and joint ventures (including transaction
costs), contingent consideration paid for business combinations up to the liability determined
during the measurement period and, and acquisitions and disposals of fixed assets (including
transaction costs and deferred payments), excluding finance leases.

     - Cash flows from financing activities, including new borrowings and repayments of borrowings,
issues of equity instruments, transactions between shareholders (including transaction costs
and any deferred payments), net interest paid (cash flows related to finance costs and nonrecourse factoring costs), treasury share transactions and dividend payments. This category
also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt.

In 2016, the net effect of these transactions on the Group's cash and cash equivalents resulted mainly from
the acquisition of control of Geimex (cash outflow of €44 million) (note 3.1.6) and the acquisition of various
controlling interests in the Franprix – Leader Price subgroup (cash outflow of €37 million of which amount
paid of €32 million for these acquisitions) (note 3.1.4).

In 2015, the impact of these transactions on cash and cash equivalents mainly comprised:
   - acquisition of control of Super Inter (cash outflow of €124 million) (note 3.2.2);
   - acquisition of controlling interests in various subgroups by Franprix – Leader Price (cash outflow of
€53 million);
   - Disco cash acquired (€49 million) (note 3.2.1);
   - assets exchange under the agreement with Cafam (cash outflow of €17 million) (note 3.2.4).

#### Note 5 Segment information

**Accounting principle**

In accordance with IFRS 8 - Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis as the
Group's internal reporting system as used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Following the disposal of operations in Thailand and Vietnam (note 3.1.1) and the business merger between
Cnova Brazil and Via Varejo followed by their reclassification as "Assets held for sale" (note 2), the Group's
reportable segments are now:

    - France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments in France (mainly the Casino,
Monoprix, Franprix–Leader Price and Vindémia subgroups banners)

    - Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin America
(mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco–Devoto and Libertad subgroups banners).

    - E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding company.

The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms of product
type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution methods, marketing
offer and long-term financial performance.

The reportable segments therefore reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual
strategy and the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real estate
asset management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities.

Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales and trading profit (which
includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group's business units) and EBITDA. EBITDA is
defined as trading profit plus current depreciation and amortisation expense.

Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are
therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information.

Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

###### 6.3 Expenses by nature and function

**Accounting principle**

Selling expenses
Selling expenses consist of point-of-sale costs, property development and property trading business costs and
changes in inventories.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including the
purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions.

Pre-opening and post-closure costs
When they do not meet the criteria for capitalisation, costs incurred prior to the opening or after the closure of a
store are recognised in operating expense when incurred.

(*) Logistics costs are reported in the consolidated income statement under "Cost of goods sold".

A competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE) was introduced in France, corresponding to a tax credit
(refundable if not used within three years) based on a percentage of salaries that do not exceed 2.5x the French
minimum wage (SMIC). The rate was 6% in 2016 (9% for Vindémia), rising to 7% for salaries paid as from 1
January 2017. The Group recognised in 2016 this CICE income of €96 million (2015: €93 million) as a deduction
from employee benefits expense and sold without recourse its receivable for €88 million net of the discount (2015:
€88 million).

###### 6.5 Other operating income and expenses

**Accounting principle**

This caption covers two types of items:

 - Income and expenses arising from major events occurring during the period that would distort analyses of
the Group's recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are
limited in number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs
and provisions and expenses for litigation and risks.

 - Income and expenses which, by definition, are not included in an assessment of a business unit’s recurring
operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses on
non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope of consolidation (for example,
transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from disposals of subsidiaries,
remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests).

(i) Impairment losses recognised in 2016 mainly concerned isolated store assets in the France Retail segment (mainly Franprix
–Leader Price and Distribution Casino France for €28 million) and the E-commerce segment for €10 million. In 2015,
impairment loss primarily concerned isolated assets in the France Retail and E-commerce segments for €15 million and €10
million, respectively.
(ii) In 2016, the €154 million net expense related to changes in the scope of consolidation concerned the France Retail
segment for €143 million, primarily reflecting changes in the Franprix – Leader Price subgroup for €72 million (including €59
million for the transactions described in note 3.1.4) and Distribution Casino France for €34 million (note 3.1.5), and
transaction costs of €19 million, partly offset by the €16 million effect of measuring at fair value the previously-held interest
in Geimex when the Group acquired control of this company (note 3.1.6). The €72 million net income recognised in 2015
included the €262 million positive effect of measuring at fair value the previously-held interest in Disco when the Group
acquired control of this company (note 3.2.1), costs of -€56 million for the reorganisation of operations in Latin America, and
the effects of changes in consolidation scope in the France Retail segment, together with related expenses, for a total of €125 million (mainly €58 million for the transaction at Franprix – Leader Price described in note 3.2.3 and €48 million in
development fees).
(iii) Restructuring provisions and expenses for 2016 mainly concerned the France Retail segment for €207 million (including
employee costs of €58 million, rent of closed stores of €25 million, external costs of €57 million and impairment losses and
scrapped assets of €67 million) and GPA for €26 million. Restructuring provisions and expenses for 2015 mainly concerned
the France Retail segment for €195 million (including employee severance costs of €50 million, store closure costs of €70
million and costs of €71 million for deployment of the new concept) and GPA for €31 million.
(iv) Provisions and charges for litigation and risks concerned GPA for an amount of €106 million, mainly covering tax risks. In
2015, provisions and expenses for litigation and risks concerned the Latam Retail segment (primarily GPA) for €92 million
and the France Retail segment for €28 million. The largest single item concerned the litigation with Morzan
Empreendimentos (€113 million).
(v) Including €43 million related to the 2015 tax on retail space (TaSCom) payable in France. Following the introduction of new
tax rules which led to a change in the period in which this levy is recognised, the TaSCom due for 2015 was recognised in
full at the beginning of 2016 (in "Other operating expenses") and the TaSCom for 2016 was recognised on a straight line
basis over the year (in "Trading profit").

###### 6.6 Inventories

**Accounting principle**

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and probable net realisable value. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the
probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis is made taking into account the business unit's
operating environment and the type, age and turnover characteristics, and sales pattern of the products
concerned.

The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by the
GPA subgroup which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA's
inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method was
applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in
bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in the carrying
amount together with supplier discounts deducted from "Cost of goods sold". The cost of inventories also
includes gains or losses on cash flow hedges of future inventory purchases initially accumulated in equity.

For its property development and property trading businesses, the Casino Group recognises assets and
projects in progress in inventories.

###### 6.7 Trade receivables

**Accounting principle**

Trade receivables are current financial assets (note 11) initially recognised at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. The fair value of trade receivables usually corresponds
to the amount on the invoice. An impairment loss is recognised for trade receivables as soon as a probable loss
emerges. Trade receivables can be sold to banks and continue to be carried as assets in the statement of
financial position for as long as all the related risks and rewards are not transferred to a third party.

#### Note 7 Leases

**Accounting principle**

At the inception of an agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease
agreement.
The Group's lease agreements are recognised in accordance with IAS 17 which distinguishes between finance
leases and operating leases.

Finance lease agreements
Lease agreements for property, plant and equipment that transfer nearly all the risks and benefits inherent to
ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. After initial recognition, the assets are depreciated over their expected useful life in
the same way as other assets in the same category, or over the lease term if shorter, unless the Group has a
reasonable certainty that it will obtain ownership at the end of lease.
Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between interest’s expense and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period covered by the lease agreement so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Operating leases
The other lease agreements are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group's statement
of financial position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Incentives received from the lessor are an integral part of the total net rental expense
and are recorded as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments (note 7.3) correspond to fixed future minimum payments calculated over the noncancellable term of operating leases.

Prepaid rents
In Vietnam and Thailand, the Group made lease payments in advance linked to the use of the land. These
payments were initially recognised as prepaid expenses and recorded in profit or loss over the lease term.

###### 7.1 Operating lease expenses

Rental expenses related to operating leases amounted to €875 million in 2016 (including €791 million for real
estate leases, of which €532 million in the France Retail segment and €183 million in Brazil) and €874 million in
2015 (including €795 million for real estate leases, of which €557 million in the France Retail segment and €163
million in Brazil). This information only concerns continuing operations.

The amount of future operating lease payments and minimum lease payments to be received under noncancellable sub-leases are presented in note 7.3.

###### 7.2 Prepaid rents

Non-current prepaid expenses (note 6.9) included prepaid rents of €135 million as at 31 December 2015. They
corresponded to the right to use lands in Thailand over an average period of 26 years, and with the cost
recognised over the period of use.

**8.2.2 Presentation of pension plans**

###### DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

Defined contribution plans are plans in which the company pays regular contributions into a fund. The company's
obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute to the fund and it offers no guarantee that the fund will
have sufficient assets to pay all of the employees' entitlements to benefits. This type of plan predominantly
concerns employees of the Group's French subsidiaries, who are covered by the general social security system,
which is administered by the French government.

In 2016, the cost of defined contribution plans – covering 87% of the Group's French subsidiaries – was €335
million (2015: €350 million cost excluding discontinued operations, covering 86% of French subsidiaries).

###### DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

In certain countries, local laws or conventional agreements provide for the payment of a lump sum to employees
either when they retire or at certain times post-retirement, based on their years of service and final salary at the
age of retirement.

**8.2.3 Main assumptions used in determining total defined benefit obligations**
**(pension plans)**

Defined benefit plans are exposed to risks concerning future interest rates, salaries and mortality rates.

The following table presents the main actuarial assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation:

**France** **International**

**2016** **2015** **2016** **2015**

Discount rate **1.7%** 2.2% **1.7% - 7.8%** 2.0% - 7.5%

Expected rate of future salary increases **1.5% - 2.0%** 1.5% - 2.0% **1.9% - 3.5%** 1.31% - 10.0%

Retirement age **62-64 years** 62-64 years **57-65 years** 55-65 years

For French companies, the discount rate is determined by reference to the Bloomberg 15-year AA corporate
composite index.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

A 100-basis point increase (decrease) in the discount rate would have the effect of reducing the projected benefit
obligation by 9.8% (increasing the projected benefit obligation by 14.7%).

A 100-basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of salary increases would have the effect of increasing
the projected benefit obligation by 14.4% (reducing the projected benefit obligation by 9.7%).

Free shares are granted to certain company managers and store managers. In certain cases, the shares vest in
tranches, subject to the attainment of a performance target for the period concerned. In all cases, the shares are
forfeited if the grantee leaves the Group before the end of the vesting period.

**8.3.1 Impact of share-based payments on earnings and equity**

The total net expense of share-based payment plans recorded in the income statement was €15 million in 2016
(2015: €7 million), including €8 million for Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and €7 million for GPA. The impact on
equity was an increase for the same amount.

**8.3.2 Casino, Guichard-Perrachon stock option plans**

As at 31 December 2016, no Casino, Guichard-Perrachon stock options were outstanding. The last two stock

#### Note 9 Income tax

**Accounting principle**

Income tax expense corresponds to the sum of the current taxes due by the various Group companies,
adjusted for deferred taxes.
Substantially all qualifying French subsidiaries are members of the tax group headed by Casino, GuichardPerrachon and file a consolidated tax return.
Current tax expense reported in the income statement corresponds to the tax expense of the parent company
of the tax group and of companies that are not members of a tax group.
Deferred tax assets correspond to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences, tax loss
carryforwards and certain consolidation adjustments that are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for:

  - taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability results from recognition of a nondeductible impairment loss on goodwill or from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit
nor taxable profit or the tax loss; and

  - taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except
when the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is probable that it will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.

Deferred taxes are recognised using the balance sheet approach and in accordance with IAS 12. They are
calculated by the liability method, which consists of adjusting deferred taxes recognised in prior periods for the
effect of any enacted changes in the income tax rate.
The Group reviews the probability of deferred tax assets being recovered on a periodic basis for each tax
entity. This review may, if necessary, lead to the derecognition of deferred tax assets recognised in prior years.
The probability for recovery is assessed based on a tax plan indicating the level of projected taxable profits.
The taxable profit used in the assessment is based on that generally obtained over a five-year period. The
assumptions underlying the tax plan are consistent with those used in the medium-term business plans and
budgets prepared by the Group's entities and approved by management.

The French corporate value-added tax (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises - CVAE) which is
based on the value-added reflected in the separate financial statements, is included in "Income tax expense" in
the consolidated income statement.

When payments to holders of equity instruments are deductible for tax purposes, the tax effect is recognised
by the Group in the income statement.

(i) The reconciliation of the effective tax rate paid by the Group is based on the current French rate of 34.43%. This rate does
not take into account the transitional 10.7% surtax due in 2015 by French companies with revenues in excess of €250
million.
(ii) In 2016, this concerned the E-commerce segment (mainly Cdiscount France) for €48 million. The reported amount for
2015 included €85 million concerning the E-commerce segment and €59 million concerning Ségisor and related to the
reorganisation of the Group's businesses in Latin America.
(iii) Following adoption of the 2017 Finance Act (as at 20 December 2016) relating to income tax rate progressive
modification, differed taxes have been calculated with income tax rate applicable when temporary differences will occur, it
means with a rate of 28.92% in 2020.
(iv) Tax laws in some countries cap the deductibility of interest paid by companies. In France, since the 2012 amended
Finance Act, companies are required to add back 25% of interest expense to their taxable profit. In the case of the Group,
this measure increased income tax expense by €16 million in 2016 (2015: €24 million).

The tax saving realised by the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon tax group amounted to €280 million in 2016 (2015:
€323 million).

Deferred tax assets recognised for tax loss carryforwards are primarily related to GPA and Casino GuichardPerrachon, for €377 million and €33 million respectively at 31 December 2016. Recovery of these assets is
considered probable in light of these companies' projected taxable profits and the tax options chosen by their
management. The recovery plan will run respectively for Casino, Guichard-and GPA until 2025 and 2018.

**9.2.4 Unrecognised deferred tax assets**

As at 31 December 2016, unrecognised deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards amounted to €522 million,
representing an unrecognised deferred tax effect of €150 million (31 December 2015: €511 million, representing
an unrecognised deferred tax effect of €168 million). The loss carryforwards mainly concern Ségisor, the Franprix

#### Note 10 Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property

**Accounting principle**

The cost of fixed assets corresponds to their purchase cost plus transaction expenses including tax. For
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property, these expenses are added to the
assets' carrying amount and follow the same accounting treatment.

###### 10.1 Goodwill

**Accounting principle**

At the acquisition date, goodwill is measured in accordance with the accounting principle applicable to "Business
combinations", described in note 3. It is allocated to the cash generating unit or groups of cash generating units
that benefit from the synergies of the combination, based on the level at which the return on investment is
monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is not amortised. It is tested for impairment at each yearend, or whenever events or a change of circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Impairment losses on
goodwill are not reversible. The methods used by the Group to test goodwill for impairment are described in the
"Impairment of non-current assets" section in note 10.5. Negative goodwill is recognised directly in the income
statement for the period of the business combination, once the identification and measurement of the acquiree's
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been verified.

million.
(ii) In 2016, goodwill written off on disposals mainly concerned operations in Thailand.
(iii) Goodwill reclassified as "Assets held for sale" in 2016 mainly concerned Via Varejo.

###### 10.2 Other intangible assets

**Accounting principle**

Intangible assets acquired separately by the Group are initially recognised at cost and those acquired in
business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Intangible assets consist mainly of purchased
software, software developed for internal use, trademarks, patents and lease premiums. Trademarks that are
created and developed internally are not recognised in the statement of financial position. Intangible assets are
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as determined separately for each asset
category. Capitalised development costs are amortised over three years and software over three to ten years.
Indefinite life intangible assets (including lease premiums and purchased trademarks) are not amortised, but are
tested for impairment at each year-end or whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be
recovered.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use
or disposal. The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between the
net sale proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset. It is recognised in profit or loss ("Other operating
income and expenses") when the asset is derecognised.

Residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed at each year-end and revised prospectively
if necessary.

**10.3.3 Capitalised borrowing costs**

**Accounting principle**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (typically more than six months) are
capitalised in the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in
which they are incurred. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by an entity in connection with
the borrowing of funds.

Interest capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2016 amounted to €15 million, reflecting an average
interest rate of 8.4% (2015: €5 million of which €1 million for discontinued operations at an average rate of
13.1%). The increase in the capitalised amount in 2016 compared to the prior year concerned operations in
Colombia.

million, including €1,510 million for properties held by Big C Thailand). For most investment properties, fair value
is determined on the basis of valuations carried out by independent external appraisers. In accordance with
international valuation standards, they are based on market value as confirmed by market indicators, representing
a level 3 fair value input.

###### 10.5 Impairment of non-current assets


-----

**10.5.1 Movements for the year**

Impairment losses recognised in 2016 on goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment totalled
€115 million, of which €58 million arose from restructuring operations (mainly in the France Retail segment) and
€49 million corresponded to individual assets (mainly in the France Retail and E-commerce segments).

Following the tests carried out in 2015, impairment losses totalling €115 million were recognised on goodwill,
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment excluding discontinued operations (of which €88 million
arose from restructuring operations and consolidation scope changes in the France Retail segment, €15 million
corresponded to individual assets in the France Retail segment and €10 million concerned capitalised software
development costs in France).

**10.5.2 Goodwill impairment losses**

Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amounts of the cash generating unit (CGU) or
groups of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated and comparing them with the carrying amounts of the relevant
assets. Goodwill arising on the initial acquisition of networks is allocated to the groups of CGUs in accordance
with the classifications presented in note 10.1.1. Some goodwill may also occasionally be allocated directly to
CGUs.

For internal valuations, annual impairment testing generally consists of determining the recoverable amount of
each CGU based on value in use, in accordance with the principles described in note 10.1. Value in use is
determined by the discounted cash flows method, based on after-tax cash flows and using the following rates.

Assumptions used for internal calculations of 2016 values in use

**2016 perpetual** **2016 after-tax** **2015 perpetual** **2015 after-tax**
**Region**

**growth rate (i)** **discount rate (ii)** **growth rate (i)** **discount rate (ii)**

France (retail) (iii) **1.7%** **5.6%** 1.5% 5.5%

France (other businesses) (iii) **1.7% to 2.2%** **5.6% to 7.2%** 1.5% to 2% 5.5% to 7.3%

Argentina **8.5%** **17.1%** 10.2% 17.7%

Brazil (iv) **6.0%** **12.4% and 11.6% (vi)** 5.5% 11.3% to 13.6%

Colombia (iv) **3.0%** **8.9%** 3.5% 8.5%

Uruguay **6.6%** **13.2%** 8.5% 15.8%

Indian Ocean (v) **1.7% to 5.5%** **5.6% to 14.2%** 1.5% to 5.2% 5.5% to 13.0%

(i) The inflation-adjusted perpetual growth rate ranges from 0% to +1.5% depending on the nature of the CGU's
business/banner and CGU’s country.
(ii) The discount rate corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each country. WACC is calculated at
least once a year during the annual impairment testing exercise by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk
premium and the Group's cost of debt.
(iii) For the French businesses, the discount rate also takes account of the CGU's type of business/banner and the associated
operational risks.
(iv) As at 31 December 2016, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €4,247 million,
€2,107 million and €1,785 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than the
carrying amount of the subsidiaries' net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based on their
value in use (see below).
(v) The Indian Ocean region includes Reunion, Mayotte, Madagascar and Mauritius. The discount rates used reflect the risks
inherent in each of these regions.
(vi) Discount rate applied to cash flows is 12.4% for the business plan period of three years and is 11.6% beyond to take into
account inflation and interest rate assumptions for the considered years of flows

No impairment loss was recognised as at 31 December 2016 from the annual goodwill impairment test conducted
at the end of the year.

With the exception of Franprix – Leader Price, in view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying
amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key
assumptions set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers
reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 25basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point decrease in
the EBITDA margin for the cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value. Applying this sensitivity test
to the Codim CGU (the France Retail subsidiary in Corsica) resulted in a recoverable amount close to the carrying
amount of the net assets.


-----

The recoverable amount of the Franprix – Leader Price CGU was determined by reference to its value in use,
calculated from cash flow projections based on three-year financial budgets approved by executive management,
extrapolation of projections over a period of three years and a 5.6 % discount rate (2015: 5.5%).

The cash flow projections for the budget period were based on the following assumptions:

- Ongoing development of the Mandarine concept at Franprix and development of a new concept at Leader
Price.

- Ongoing deployment of a banner strategy based on a balance between integrated management stores and
franchisees.

- The profitability of the two banners will increase, led by larger product volumes and optimised store and
upstream function cost bases. Franprix – Leader Price expects this strategy to lift EBITDA margin to a level in
line with its historical high by the end of 2020.

Management believes that a change in a key assumption could result in a carrying amount greater than the
recoverable amount. The table below shows the change in each of the key assumptions that would be required
for the estimated recoverable amount of the Franprix – Leader Price CGU to be the same as its carrying amount
(including €2,582 million in goodwill).

**Change required for the Franprix** –Leader Price CGU's carrying

**31 December 2016 (i)** **31 December 2015**

**amount to be the same as its recoverable amount**


After-tax discount rate (5.6%) **+100 bps** +100 bps

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (0%) **-120 bps** -110 bps

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-120 bps** -130 bps

(i) With a reasonable 100-bps increase in the discount rate, or/and a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the cash
flow projection, the carrying amount of the Franprix – Leader Price CGU would exceed its recoverable amount by between
zero and €250 million.

**10.5.3 Trademark impairment losses**

The recoverable amounts of trademarks were estimated at the year-end using the "discounted cash flows"
method. The main trademarks concern GPA. In light of the less favourable economic environment in Brazil, the
Extra banner's trademark was considered to be the most exposed to a risk of impairment. However, the tests
carried out as at
31 December 2016 did not reveal any evidence that the trademark's carrying amount might not be recoverable.

The table below shows the change in each of the key assumptions that would be required for the estimated
recoverable amount of the Extra trademark to be the same as its carrying amount:

**Change required for the Extra trademark's carrying amount to be the same as its**

**31 December 2016 (i)**

**recoverable amount**

Perpetual growth rate net of inflation (1.5%) **-110 bps**

After-tax discount rate (12.4% and 11.6%) (ii) **+60 bps**

EBITDA margin used for the annual cash flow projection **-50 bps**

(i) With a reasonable 100-bps increase in the discount rate, or/and a 50-bps decrease in the EBITDA margin used for the cash
flow projection and/or a 25-bps decrease in the perpetual growth rate, the carrying amount of the Extra CGU (including the
trademark) would exceed its recoverable amount by between zero and €424 million.
(ii) Discount rate applied to cash flows is 12.4% for the business plan period of three years and is 11.6% beyond to take into
account inflation and interest rate assumptions for the considered years of flows

#### Note 11 Financial structure and finance costs


**Accounting principle**


-----

The Group has set up receivables discounting programmes with banks. These programmes generally meet
the conditions for derecognition of financial assets under IAS 39 described above. The Group considers as
insignificant the risk of discounted receivables being cancelled by credit notes or being set off against
liabilities. The main receivables discounting programmes relate to GPA. The programmes are set up with
banks and credit card issuers and correspond for the most part to sales of credit card receivables (in Brazil, it
takes several weeks for vendors to receive settlement of credit card transactions). The contract terms do not
include any rights of subrogation or related obligations and the risks and rewards of ownership of the
receivables are transferred to the bank or credit card issuer which controls them.
The other receivables discounting programmes have been set up in France and concern trade and tax
receivables. In this case also, the risks and rewards of ownership of the receivables are transferred to the
bank.

###### 11.3 Net finance costs and other financial income and expenses, net

In 2016, the Group reviewed the presentation of non-recourse factoring costs within net financial income /
(expense). These costs, which were included in "Net finance costs", will now be included in "Other financial
income and expenses". The Group believes that this voluntary change of presentation improves the quality of its
financial disclosures, as it permits direct reconciliations between "Net finance costs" and "Net debt". The
reclassification qualifies as a change in accounting method and has therefore been applied retrospectively,
leading to a restatement of 2015 figures..

**Accounting principle**

**Net finance costs**

Net finance costs correspond to all income and expenses generated by cash and cash equivalents and financial
liabilities during the period, including income from cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses on disposals of
cash equivalents, interest expense on financial liabilities, gains and losses on interest rate hedges (including the
ineffective portion) and related currency effects, and trade payable – structured program costs.

**Other financial income and expenses**

This item corresponds to financial income and expenses that are not included in net finance costs.

It includes dividends received from non-consolidated companies, non-recourse factoring costs, discounting
adjustments (including to provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations), gains and
losses arising from remeasurement at fair value of equity derivatives, and impairment losses and realised gains
and losses on financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents. Exchange gains and losses are also
recorded under this caption, apart from (i) exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents and financial
liabilities, which are presented under net finance costs, and (ii) the effective portion of accounting hedges of
operating transactions, which are included in trading profit.

Financial discounts for prompt payments are recognised in financial income for the portion corresponding to the
normal market interest rate and as a deduction from cost of goods sold for the supplement.

**Finance costs** **(434)** **(369)**

**Net finance costs** **(324)** **(240)**

(i) Following the change in presentation of non-recourse factoring costs within net financial income (expense), the financial
statements of 2016 have been restated. Consequently, the line "Interest expense on borrowings after hedging" at 31
December 2015 has been restated by €53 million (excluding discontinued operations).
(ii) In 2016, income of €13 million was recognised following exercise of the call option on the mandatory convertible bonds
issued by Monoprix (note 2). In addition, the bond buybacks described in note 2 led to the recognition of a €33 million gain
in 2016 (not including the effect of future interest savings). In 2015, income of €11 million was recognised following an
agreed reduction in the interest rate on the Monoprix mandatory convertible bonds (6-month Euribor plus 410 bps).

(i) Non-recourse factoring costs were previously reported under "Interest expense on borrowings after hedging" (note 11.3.1)
(ii) The net gain of €69 million reported in 2016 mainly reflects (a) positive fair value adjustments to the GPA TRS (€30 million)
and GPA forward (€15 million including impact of forward renegotiating and costs included), and (b) the positive fair value
adjustment to the Big C Thailand TRS (€23 million) which was unwound during the year. In 2015, the net expense of €327
million was primarily due to negative fair value adjustments to the Big C Thailand TRS (€17 million); the GPA TRS (€162
million) and the GPA forward (€154 million).

The Group entered into Total Return Swap (TRS) and forward contracts on GPA and Big C Thailand shares. The
contracts do not allow physical delivery of the shares and are cash-settled instruments. The documentation states
that when the contracts expire, the shares will be sold on the market by the banking counterparties, and the
Group will receive or pay the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid by the counterparties to
purchase the shares at the contracts' inception. The Group retains the economic benefits of ownership of the
shares (exposure to changes in the subsidiaries' share prices and collection of dividends) but does not have legal
title to the shares and cannot exercise the related voting rights. Details of the contracts are as follows:

- In December 2011, the Group entered into a 2.5-year TRS with a financial institution on 7.9 million GPA
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). On 23 December 2016, the contract's maturity was extended to June
2018 and the interest rate was set at 3-month Euribor plus 269.5 bps. This TRS is a derivative instrument
measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31 December 2016, it related to 7.8 million ADRs (2.9% of
GPA's capital) representing a notional amount of €332 million, and had a negative fair value of €209 million
(31 December 2015: 7.8 million ADRs, a notional amount of €332 million and a negative fair value of €247
million).

- At the end of December 2012, the Group entered into a 2-year forward contract on 5.8 million GPA shares. On
28 July 2016, the maturity was extended and the notional amount was reduced by USD 105 million (€95
million), resulting in a cash payment made by the Group on the same day. The interest rate currently
corresponds to
3-month Libor plus 276 bps and the contract expires in February 2018. This forward is a derivative instrument
measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31 December 2016, it related to 5.8 million shares (2.2% of
GPA's capital) representing a notional amount of USD 239 million (€227 million), and had a negative fair value
of €134 million (31 December 2015: 5.8 million shares, a notional amount of USD 338 million (€310 million)
and a negative fair value of €248 million).

- In 2012, the Group entered into a TRS with a financial institution on 20.6 million Big C Thailand shares. The
TRS was settled in 2016, leading to the recognition of €23 million in "Other financial income" corresponding to
the net cash settlement on the TRS for €2 million and the positive change of fair value for €21 million. As at 31
December 2015, the TRS's notional amount was €127 million and its fair value was a negative €21 million.

These instruments' fair value is determined based on the estimated settlement price on 31 December, using the
share price on that date. The instruments had a negative fair value of €343 million as at 31 December 2016
(2015: negative fair value of €516 million) (note 11.5.1).

###### 11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

**Accounting principle**

Fair value measurements are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs
used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);

 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2);

 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level
3).

The fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is the quoted price on the reporting date. A
market is considered as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer,
broker, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm's length basis. These instruments are classified as Level 1.

The fair value of financial instruments which are not quoted in an active market (such as over-the-counter
derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. These techniques use observable market data wherever
possible and make little use of the Group's own estimates. If all the inputs required to calculate fair value are
observable, the instrument is classified as Level 2.

If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as Level
3.

( )(i) The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets is generally measured using standard valuation techniques. If their fair

value cannot be determined reliably, they are not included in this note.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments are valued (internally or externally) on the basis of the widely used valuation techniques for
this type of instrument. Valuation models are based on observable market inputs (mainly the yield curve) and counterparty
quality. Derivatives held as fair value hedges are almost fully backed by borrowings.
(iii) The fair value of bonds is based on the latest quoted price on the reporting date.
(iv) The fair value of other borrowings has been measured using other valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow
method, taking into account the Group's credit risk and interest rate conditions at the reporting date.
(v) The fair value of put options granted to owners of non-controlling interests is measured by applying the contract's calculation
formulae and is discounted, if necessary; these formulae are considered to be representative of the fair value and notably
use EBITDA multiples.

###### 11.5 Financial risk management objectives and policies


The main risks associated with the Group's financial instruments are market risk (currency risk, interest rate risk
and equity risk), counterparty risk and liquidity risk.

Financial risk monitoring and management is the responsibility of the Corporate finance department, which is part
of the Group Finance department. This team manages all financial exposures in coordination with the finance
departments of the Group's main subsidiaries and reports to executive management. It has issued a Good
Financial Practice Guide governing all financing, investment and hedging transactions carried out by Group
entities.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward
currency transactions to manage its exposure to interest rate risks and currency risks. These instruments are
mainly over-the-counter instruments contracted with first-class bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or
derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting.
However, like many other large corporates, the Group may take very small, strictly controlled speculative
positions as part of its hedging policy, for more dynamic and flexible management of its interest rate positions.

As at 31 December 2016, the fair value hedge derivatives presented a net positive balance of €203 million. The
total included “interest rate risk” derivatives in France with a positive fair value of €253 million and “currency risk”
derivatives in Brazil and Colombia with negative fair values of €49 million and €1 million, respectively. All the
currency derivatives are backed by bank borrowings or bonds denominated in a currency other than the borrower
entity's functional currency. The ineffective portion of these fair value hedges is not material.

As at 31 December 2016, the cash flow hedge reserve included in equity had a credit balance of €19 million
(31 December 2015: credit balance of €27 million). These derivatives are related to France perimeter and were
acquired to hedge goods purchases billed in currencies other than the euro (mainly the US dollar). The ineffective
portion of these cash flow hedges is not material.

Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 had a negative fair value of €328
million as at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: negative fair value of €519 million). They included TRSs
and forward contracts with a negative fair value of €343 million as at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015:
negative fair value of €516 million) (note 11.3.2).

The fair value calculation as at 31 December 2016 took into account the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and
the debit valuation adjustment (DVA) in accordance with IFRS 13. The impact of these adjustments is not
material.

**11.5.2 Market risk**

**INTEREST RATE RISK**

The Group's objective is to manage its exposure to the risk of interest rate changes and optimise its financing
cost. Its strategy therefore consists of dynamic debt management by monitoring and, where necessary, adjusting
its hedging ratio based on forecast trends in interest rates.

Various derivative instruments are used to manage interest rate risks. The main instruments are interest rate
swaps. Group financial policy consists of managing finance costs by combining variable and fixed-rate derivative
instruments. These instruments do not always qualify for hedge accounting; however all interest-rate instruments
are contracted in line with the above risk management policy.

Specifically, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt is mainly composed of fixed-rate bonds (principal amount of
€5,981 million as at 31 December 2016). This bond debt may be hedged through fixed-to-variable rate swaps
generally contracted at the issue date; all of these hedges qualify for hedge accounting.
During 2016, the Group unwound interest rate swaps hedging the bonds that were bought back and cancelled
during the year. Casino also decided to increase its fixed rate exposure by unwinding interest rate swaps which
reduced by €2 billion the variable rate exposure of the Group.
As at 31 December 2016, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon had a portfolio of 30 interest rate swaps with a dozen of
bank counterparties, representing a variable rate exposure on a total notional amount of €3,022 million. The
swaps expire at various dates between 2021 and 2026.
As a result, as at 31 December 2016, 49% of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's bond debt was at fixed rates of
interest and 51% was at variable rates.

**SENSITIVITY TO A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES**
Sensitivity to rate changes is calculated as shown in the table below.

**(€ millions)** **Notes** **2016** **2015 restated**

Casino, Guichard Perrachon variable-rate bonds [(1)] **3,022** 6,396

Brazil variable-rate bonds [(2)] 11.2.2 **703** 209

Other variable-rate borrowings and financial liabilities [(3) (4) (5)] 11.2.3 **2,218** 2,864

Finance lease 7.6 **79**

**Total variable-rate bonds, other borrowings and financial liabilities** **6,021** **9,549**

Cash and cash equivalents 11.1.1 **(5,750)** (4,588)

**Net variable-rate position** **272** **4,961**

100-bps change in interest rate **3**

Net finance costs 11.3.1 **324** 241

**Impact of change on net finance costs** **0.8%** **20.6%**

(1) Corresponding to fixed-rate bonds for a notional amount of €5,981 million (2015: €7,346 million) (note 11.2.2), covered by
an interest rate hedge on a net notional amount of €3,022 million as at 31 December 2016 (2015: €6,396 million).
(2) Principal amount
(3) Excluding accrued interest.
(4) Including borrowings in Brazil originally denominated in dollars or euros for BRL 2,458 million (€717 million) converted to
reals and variable interest rates by means of cross-currency swaps (2015: BRL €3,171 million, representing €735 million).
(5) Including borrowings in Colombia originally denominated in dollars for COP 1,249 billion (€395 million) of which 44%
converted to pesos and variable interest rates by means of cross-currency swaps.

Assuming the net debt structure and management policy are constant, a 100-bps annual increase (decrease) in
rates across the yield curve would lead to a 0.8% (€3 million) increase (decrease) in finance costs. For the
purposes of the analysis, all other variables, particularly exchange rates, are assumed to be constant.

**EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY RISK**

Due to its geographical diversification, the Group is exposed to currency translation risk; in other words, its
statement of financial position and income statement, and consequently its financial ratios, are sensitive to
movements in exchange rates on consolidation of the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries outside the
euro zone. It is also exposed to currency risk on transactions not denominated in euros.

The Group's policy in this respect is to hedge highly probable budgeted exposures, which mainly involve
purchases made in a currency other than its functional currency and particularly purchases in US dollars.
Substantially all budgeted purchases are hedged using instruments with the same maturities as the underlying
transactions. All borrowings denominated in a currency other than the borrower's functional currency are fully
hedged.


-----

The Group's net exposure based on notional amounts after hedging mainly concerns the US dollar (excluding the
functional currencies of entities), as shown below:

**Total exposure** **Of which** **Total exposure**
**(€ millions)**

**2016** **USD** **2015**

Exposed trade receivables **(18)** **(8)** (20)

**Gross exposure payable/(receivable)** **1,054** **1,019** **1,311**

**Net exposure payable/(receivable)** **115** **136** **532**

**Hedges of future purchases** **276** **275**

As at 31 December 2015, the net statement of financial position exposure of €532 million mainly concerned the
US dollar.

**SENSITIVITY OF NET EXPOSURE AFTER CURRENCY HEDGING**

A 10% appreciation of the euro as at 31 December 2016 against the currencies included in the Group's exposure
would lead to an increase of profit for the amounts indicated in the following table. For the purposes of the
analysis, all other variables, particularly interest rates, are assumed to be constant.

**(€ millions)** **2016** **2015**

US dollar **14** 54

Other currencies **(2)** (1)

**Total** **12** **53**

A 10% depreciation of the euro against those currencies as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 would have produced
the opposite effect.

**EQUITY RISK**

As at 31 December 2016, the Group did not hold any significant investments in listed companies other than
interests in its subsidiaries or treasury shares.


-----

The Group may use derivative instruments (e.g. total return swaps with no call option, forward contracts and call
options) on shares to build a synthetic exposure to the shares of its listed subsidiaries (note 11.3.2). The carrying
amount of these instruments corresponds to their estimated value as provided by a financial institution on the
reporting date. These values take account of market data such as exchange rates, share prices and interest
rates.

In addition, the Group does not hold any options or any derivatives backing its own shares. Its policy as regards
cash management is to invest only in money market instruments that are not exposed to equity risk.

**11.5.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group is exposed to various aspects of counterparty risk through its operating activities, cash deposits and
interest rate and currency hedging instruments. It monitors these risks regularly using several objective indicators,
and diversifies its exposure by dealing with the least risky counterparties (based mainly on their credit ratings and
their reciprocal commitments with the Group).

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO TRADE RECEIVABLES**

Customer credit risk:
Group policy consists of checking the financial health of all customers applying for credit payment terms.
Customer receivables are regularly monitored; consequently, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not material.

Trade receivables break down as follows by maturity:

**Past-due receivables on the reporting date, not impaired**

**Receivables**

**Impaired**

**(€ millions)** **not yet due,** **Between one** **More than** **Total**

**Up to one month** **receivables**

**not impaired** **and six months** **six months** **Total**

**past due**

**past due** **past due**

**2016** **721** **79** **15** **26** **119** **117**

**2015** 698 93 50 24 167 140 1,005

The age of unimpaired past-due receivables can vary considerably depending on the type of customer, i.e. private
companies, consumers or public authorities. Impairment policies are determined on an entity-by-entity basis
according to customer type. As indicated above, the Group believes that its exposure to credit concentration risk
is not material.

**COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATED TO OTHER ASSETS**

Other assets, mainly comprising tax receivables and repayment rights are neither past due nor impaired.

Credit risk on other financial assets – mainly comprising cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial
assets and certain derivative financial instruments – corresponds to the risk of failure by the counterparty to fulfil
its obligations. The maximum risk is limited and equal to the instruments' carrying amount. The Group's cash
management policy consists of investing cash and cash equivalents with first-class counterparties and in firstclass rated instruments.


-----

**11.5.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group's liquidity policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it always has sufficient liquid assets to settle its
liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market conditions.
The main methods used consist of:

- diversifying sources of financing: public and private capital markets, banks (confirmed and non-confirmed
facilities), commercial paper, discounting of receivables;

- diversifying financing currencies: euro, the Group's other functional currencies, US dollar;

- maintaining a level of confirmed financing facilities significantly in excess of the Group's payment
obligations at any times;

- limiting the amount of annual repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule;

- managing the average maturity of financing facilities and, where appropriate, refinancing them before they
fall due.

The liquidity analysis is performed both at the Casino, Guichard-Perrachon holding company level (taking into
account the cash pooling among all wholly-owned French entities via cash-pooling agreements) and for each of
the Group's international subsidiaries.

In addition, the Group carries out non-recourse receivables discounting without continuing involvement, within the
meaning of IFRS 7, as well as reverse factoring.
Trade payables as at 31 December 2016 include payables totalling €1,034 million (of which €264 million and
€770 million respectively related to France Retail and Latam retail) that are the subject to a reverse factoring
agreement.

Most of the Group's debt is carried by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and is not secured by collateral or any
secured assets. Financing is managed by the Corporate Finance department. The main subsidiaries (GPA,
Monoprix and Éxito) also have their own financing facilities, which are not secured by collateral or any security
interests in assets and are not guaranteed by Casino (except for GPA loans borrowed from BNDES totalling €17
million as at
31 December 2016 that are secured by security interests in the financed assets and a guarantee issued by
Wilkes, which is indirectly 50% owned by Casino and 50% by Éxito).

All subsidiaries submit weekly cash reports to the Group and all new financing facilities require prior approval from
the Corporate Finance department.

As at 31 December 2016, the Group's liquidity position comprised:

- confirmed, undrawn lines of credit for a total of €4,342 million (of which €3,759 million for France);

- unrestricted cash of €5,750 million.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon has a €9 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) programme. Notes issued under
the programme totalled €5,981 million as at 31 December 2016.

Furthermore, issuance under Casino, Guichard-Perrachon’s €2,000 million commercial paper programme
amounted to €522 million as at 31 December 2016.

The Company's bond issues (other than deeply subordinated perpetual notes) have been rated BB+ by Standard
& Poor's since 21 March 2016 and BBB- by Fitch Ratings with a negative outlook since 14 December 2016.
Standard & Poor's rating downgrade from BBB- to BB+ triggered application of the coupon step-up clause
providing for a 125-bps interest rate step-up on bonds in the event of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt being
rated non-investment grade by at least one rating agency. The step-up is applicable for each issue as from the
first annual interest period beginning after 21 March 2016. Application of the step-up clause added €15 million to
finance costs in 2016. Based on currently outstanding bond debt, the impact in 2017 is estimated at €63 million
(note 2).
Bonds (other than for deeply subordinated perpetual bonds) also include a step down clause providing for a return
to the original interest rate if Casino, Guichard Perrachon's investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's and
Fitch Ratings is restored.

The Group's bank loan agreements and bond documentation include the usual pari passu negative pledge and
cross default clauses.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's facility agreements generally contain a mandatory acceleration clause in the event
of a change of control of the Company.

In addition, bonds issued by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon (except for two deeply subordinated perpetual bond
issues) contain a discretionary acceleration clause applicable if the Company's long-term senior debt rating is
downgraded to non-investment grade (or further downgraded if the rating is already non-investment grade), but
only if this downgrade is due to a change of majority shareholder (i.e. if a third party other than Rallye or one of its
related companies acquires more than 50% of Casino's voting rights).

**CASINO,** **GUICHARD-PERRACHON DEBT COVENANTS**

At the reporting date, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's debt was subject to the following hard covenants to be met at
each year-end:


**Frequency**
**Type of covenant** **Main types of debt subject to covenant**


**Result from the**

**covenant as at 31**

**December 2016**

Annual 2.4


Consolidated net debt

                        - Bilateral credit lines totalling €50 million
(i)/Consolidated EBITDA (ii) < 3.7

(i) Net debt as defined in the loan agreements may differ from net debt presented in the consolidated financial statements
(note 11.2). It corresponds to borrowings and financial liabilities including hedging instruments with a negative fair value,
less (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and short-term financial
investments, (iii) derivatives with a positive fair value classified as hedges of debt and (iv) financial assets arising from a
significant disposal of non-current assets.
(ii) EBITDA corresponds to trading profit plus recurring net depreciation and amortisation expense.

The Group considers that it will very comfortably fulfil its covenants over the next 12 months.

Casino, Guichard-Perrachon's bonds and commercial paper are not subject to any financial covenants.

**FINANCING OF SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO COVENANTS**

Most of the Group's other loan agreements –primarily concerning GPA, Éxito and Monoprix –contain hard
covenants (see table below).

(ii) Debt less cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables.
(iii) Consolidated equity (attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests).

These covenants were respected as at 31 December 2016.

**EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY RISK**

The table below presents a maturity schedule of financial liabilities as at 31 December 2016, including principal
and interest and for undiscounted amounts. For derivative financial instruments, the table has been drawn up
based on the contractual net cash inflows and outflows on instruments that settle on a net basis and the gross
inflows and outflows on those instruments that require gross settlement. For interest rate instruments, when the
amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount presented has been determined by reference to observed
yield curves as at the reporting date.

|Type of covenant|Frequency of tests|
|---|---|
|Net debt/EBITDA < 2.5|Annual|
|Net debt (ii) may not be higher than equity (iii)|Quarterly/half- yearly/annual|
|Consolidated net debt/EBITDA < 3.25||

###### 12.1 Capital management

The Group's policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to preserve the confidence of investors, creditors
and the markets while ensuring the financial flexibility required to support the Group's future business
development. The Group aims to continually optimise its financial structure by maintaining an optimum balance
between net debt, EBITDA and equity. To this end, it may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
return part of the capital to shareholders, buy back its own shares or issue new shares. The Group may buy back
occasionally its own shares in the market. The purpose of this is to allocate the shares to the liquidity contract and
ensure active trading of its shares, to keep them, to allocate stock option plans, employee share ownership plans
or free share plans for Group employees and corporate officers.

The policy objectives and management procedures are exactly the same as in previous years.

Apart from legal requirements, the Group is not subject to any external minimum capital requirements.

###### 12.2 Share capital

As at 31 December 2016, the Company's share capital amounted to €169,825,404 (31 December 2015:
€173,192,460). Share capital is composed of 110,996,996 ordinary shares issued and fully paid as at 31
December 2016. In 2016, 2,200,690 shares for an amount of €104 million were cancelled (2015: 22,485 shares
issued upon exercise of stock options). Ordinary shares have a par value of €1.53.
Under the shareholder authorisations given to the Board of Directors, the share capital may be increased,
immediately or in the future, by up to €60 million.

###### 12.3 Share equivalents

The Group is committed to free share plans (note 8.3). The Group intends to cover those plans using existing
shares.

###### 12.4 Treasury shares

Treasury shares result from shareholder-approved buybacks of Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA shares. As at
31 December 2016, a total of 102,256 shares were held in treasury, representing €5 million. The shares were
purchased primarily for allocation upon exercise of the rights under free share plans.

In January 2005, the Group entered into a liquidity contract with the Rothschild investment bank for a total of
700,000 Casino shares plus a contribution of €40 million in cash, in compliance with European Commission
Regulation (EC) No. 2273/2003. The Group made additional contributions to the liquidity contract of (i) €30 million
on 25 September 2015 and (ii) €50 million on 28 December 2015. The 700,000 shares were subsequently
cancelled by decision of the Board of Directors on 14 June 2016.
As at 31 December 2016, no Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA shares were held in the liquidity account.
The cash earmarked for the liquidity contract is invested in money market mutual funds. These funds qualify as
cash equivalents and are therefore included in net cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of
cash flows.


-----

###### 12.5 Perpetual deeply subordinated bonds (TSSDI)

At the beginning of 2005, the Group issued 600,000 perpetual deeply subordinated bonds (TSSDI) for a total
amount of €600 million. The bonds are redeemable solely at the Group's discretion and interest payments are due
only if the Group pays a dividend on its ordinary shares in the preceding 12 months. The bonds pay interest at the
10-year constant maturity swap rate plus 100 bps, capped at 9%. In 2016, the average coupon was 1.69%.

On 18 October 2013, the Group issued €750 million of perpetual hybrid bonds (7,500 bonds) on the market. The
bonds are redeemable at the Group's discretion with the first time set for 31 January 2019. The bonds pay interest
at 4.87% until that date, after which the rate will be revised every five years.

Given the specific characteristics in terms of maturity and remuneration, the bonds are carried in equity for the
amount of €1,350 million. Issuance costs net of tax have been recorded as a deduction from equity.

###### 12.6 Other equity instruments

On 27 December 2013, Monoprix issued €500 million worth of mandatory convertible bonds to CACIB. The bonds
were convertible into Monoprix preferred stock. The bonds had a three-year life and paid interest at the 6-month
Euribor plus 410 bps (note 11.3.1). The redemption parity was fixed.

Mandatory convertible bonds are compound financial instruments with a debt component recorded in "financial
liabilities", corresponding to the discounted value of the interest payments over the life of the bonds, and an equity
component, corresponding to the balance of the bonds' value net of transaction costs and tax, recorded in "noncontrolling interests". As at 31 December 2015, the equity component amounted to €420 million (note 12.8) and
the debt component to €21 million (note 11.2.3). The Group also had a call option on the mandatory convertible
bonds which was exercised on 3 May 2016. The impact of buying back the bonds is presented in note 2.

###### 12.7 Other information on additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and reserves

**12.7.1 Foreign currency translation reserves**

The foreign currency translation reserve corresponds to cumulative exchange gains and losses on translating the
equity of foreign subsidiaries and receivables and payables included in the Group's net investment in these
subsidiaries, at the closing rate.

GPA's capital consists of:
- 99,680 thousand ordinary shares with voting rights
- 166,396 thousand preference shares without voting rights but with the right to a preferred dividend.
Preferred shares do not carry voting rights, but instead entitle holders to the following rights and benefits: (i) a
preferred right to a return of capital in the event of liquidation of the company, (ii) an annual non-cumulative
preferred dividend of at least BRL0.08 per share; (iii) a second preferred dividend equal to 110% of the dividend
paid on ordinary shares, as calculated including the non-cumulative dividend referred to in point (ii).
Casino has not granted any put options to holders of non-controlling interests in GPA. Under Brazilian securities
regulations, preferred shareholders have withdrawal rights enabling them to ask GPA to buy back their shares at
book value (i.e. net asset value per share) following the occurrence of certain specific events. These rights are
described in detail on pages 104 et seq of GPA's annual report for 2015 on Form 20-F.

###### 12.9 Dividends

At the Annual General Meeting of 13 May 2016 the shareholders approved the payment of a €3.12 cash dividend
per ordinary share for the 2015 financial year. This dividend was paid on 112,226,382 shares, representing a total
payout of €350 million recorded as a deduction from equity (2015: €352 million corresponding to the 2014
dividend payout).

During its meeting on 28 July 2016, the Board of Directors decided to pay a 2016 interim dividend of €1.56 per
share (corresponding to 50% of the 2015 annual dividend, unchanged in the last three years). The ex-dividend
date for the interim dividend was 28 November 2016 and the dividend was paid on 30 November 2016. The
interim dividend was paid on 109,360,668 shares, representing a total payout of €171 million recorded as a
deduction from equity

The Board of Directors will propose a gross dividend €3.12 per ordinary share. Based on 110,996,996 shares as
at
31 December 2016, the recommended dividend represents a provisional amount of €346 million. It will be
adjusted in 2017 to take into account the treasury shares held on the payment date. The financial statements
presented before appropriation of profit do not reflect this dividend, which is subject to shareholder approval at the
next Annual General Meeting.

###### 12.10 Earnings per share

**Accounting principle**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period, excluding shares issued in payment of dividends and treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are
calculated by the treasury stock method, as follows:

 - numerator: earnings for the period are adjusted for interest on mandatory convertible bonds and dividends
on perpetual deeply subordinated bonds;

 - denominator: basic number of shares is adjusted to include potential shares corresponding to dilutive
instruments (equity warrants, stock options and free shares), less the number of shares that could be bought
back at market price with the proceeds from the exercise of the dilutive instruments. The market price used
for the calculation corresponds to the average share price for the year.
Equity instruments that will or may be settled in Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares are included in the
calculation only when their settlement would have a dilutive impact on earnings per share.

used in the first instance to buy back shares at market price. The theoretical number of shares that would be purchased is
deducted from the total shares that would be issued on exercise of the rights attached to the warrants and options. Any
theoretical shares in excess of the number of shares resulting from the exercise of rights are not taken into account.

(i) Since the Group recorded a total comprehensive loss in 2015, the calculation of diluted earnings does not include dilutive potential ordinary
shares in the denominator.

#### Note 13 Provisions

**Accounting principle**

A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are discounted when the related adjustment
is material.
In accordance with the above principle, a provision is recorded for the cost of repairing equipment sold with a
warranty. The provision represents the estimated cost of repairs to be performed during the warranty period, as
estimated on the basis of actual costs incurred in prior years. Each year, part of the provision is reversed to offset
the actual repair costs recognised in expenses.

A provision for restructuring expenses is recorded when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure.
This is the case when management has drawn up a detailed, formal plan and has raised a valid expectation in
those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by announcing its main features to them before the periodend.

Other provisions concern specifically identified liabilities and expenses.

Contingent liabilities correspond to possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control, or
present obligations whose settlement is not expected to require an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but are disclosed in the
Notes to the financial statements.

###### 13.3 Contingent assets and liabilities

In the normal course of its business, the Group is involved in a number of legal or arbitration proceedings with
third parties or with the tax authorities in certain countries (of which mainly GPA – see below – and for €43 million
in respect of tax disputes of France Retail perimeter.

As stated in note 3.3.5, no associates or joint ventures have any significant contingent liabilities.

- **Defence proceedings initiated by the sellers of a controlling interest in Globex Utilidades**
**SA**

On 14 August 2015, GPA and Wilkes were jointly ordered by an international court of arbitration to pay
compensation to the former majority shareholder of Globex Utilidades SA – Morzan Empreendimentos – in
settlement of a dispute that arose in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in this company, now
named Via Varejo SA. The total cost of €113 million is borne equally between GPA and Wilkes, the holding
company of GPA, including compensation, interest and legal fees, was reported under "Other operating
expenses" in the 2015 income statement. The compensation was paid on 1 April 2016.

On 25 October 2016, the Brazilian regulator (CVM) ordered GPA to also pay compensation to Globex Utilidades
SA's other shareholders, in an amount corresponding to 80% of the compensation paid to Morzan
Empreendimentos. Based on a preliminary analysis by GPA, the compensation payable would amount to
approximately BRL 150 million (€44 million). GPA and its advisors have examined the terms of CVM's notification
in detail and are convinced that the arbitral award does not have the effects attributed to it by the CVM. GPA has
therefore appealed to the CVM to revise its decision. Payment of the compensation is suspended pending the
results of this appeal.

- **Class action against Cnova N.V. and the Group**
Cnova, certain of the current and former officers and directors, and the underwriters of its initial public offering,
have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit in the United States Federal District Court for
the Southern District of New York asserting claims related to macro-economic situation in Brazil and emphasized
by the irregularities identified at Cnova Brazil (note 3.5.3). Cnova may incur significant expenses (including,
without limitation, substantial attorneys’ fees and other professional advisor fees and obligations to indemnify
certain current and former officers or directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering who are or may
become parties to or involved in such matters. We are unable at this time to finalize the extent of our potential
liability in these matters, if any, even if our insurances policies for such claims have been activated. Thus no
reserve was provided for at December 31, 2016, except for the $1 million insurance deductible and some legal
costs.

In a separate potential action the SEC might take, sanctions might be imposed as a result of the facts at issue in
the internal review conducted by the Company and its advisors retained by our board of directors

- **Notices from CVM to Via Varejo and GPA**
On February 18, 2016, Via Varejo received a notice from CVM showing its different view regarding accounting
treatment related to two operations realized in the year 2013. The first relates to the acquisition by GPA to Via
Varejo of 6.2% Nova Pontocom shares (there was no effect related to this transaction in the Group consolidated
financial statements) and the second relates to accounting treatment applied to takeover of Bartira following
acquisition of additional 75% interest of Bartira. GPA and Via Varejo presented an appeal to CVM collegiate
which was accepted on January 26, 2017 related to Bartira transaction; a comity of CVM will reconsider the initial
collegiate decision related to this transaction. There is no effect related to this issue on consolidated financial
statements ended at 31 December 2016.

Assignment by the DGCCRF of EMCD
On February 28, 2017, Minister of Finance took public its decision to assign Group Casino companies following
an investigation led by the DIRECCTE of the France Central Region. It concerns a series of credit notes issue in
2013 and 2014 years by 41 suppliers for a total amount of €20.7 million and it relates to reimbursement of this
amount to the relevant suppliers, plus a civil fine of €2 million. The group Casino reaffirms its position as for the
licit character of these credit notes and makes sure that negotiation with industrialists takes place in a wellbalanced and respectful framework of applicable terms. The Group intends to dispute the reasons of this
assignment to the competent court.

#### Note 17 Standards, amendments and interpretations published but not yet mandatory

**Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union as at the reporting**
**date but not yet mandatory**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations, adopted
by the European Union but not mandatory as at 1 January 2016 and which are applicable to the Group:

**Standard**
**Description of the standard**
**(Group application date)**

IFRS 9 This standard will be applicable retrospectively.

_Financial instruments_ IFRS 9 proposes a single, logical approach to the classification
and measurement of financial assets which reflects the
business model for managing them, as well as their contractual
cash flows; a single, forward-looking impairment model based

(1 January 2018) on expected rather than incurred losses; and a new approach to

hedge accounting. The standard also requires more detailed
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.

IFRS 15 including amendment This standard will be applicable retrospectively.

IFRS 15 establishes the principles for recognising revenue from
contracts with customers (except for those covered by specific

_Revenue from contracts with customers_ standards such as leases, insurance contracts and financial

instruments). The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity will
recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
(1 January 2018) exchange for those goods or services.


Clarifications to the standard published by the IASB have not
yet been adopted by the European Union. These clarifications
do not change the underlying principles of the standard, they
simply introduce additional changes to the basis for conclusions
and provide additional illustrative guidance. The amendments
primarily address three topics: identifying performance

obligations, principal versus agent considerations, and

intellectual property licences.


The Group plans to apply IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 as from 1 January 2018. The potential impacts are currently being
analysed and are not yet known.

**Standards and interpretations not adopted by the European Union as at the reporting date**

The IASB has published the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations applicable to the
Group which have not yet been adopted by the European Union:

**Standard**
**(application date for the Group subject** **Description of the standard**
**to adoption by the EU)**

IFRS 16 This standard will be applicable retrospectively.

IFRS 16 describes how lessors and lessees should recognise,
_Leases_
measure, present and disclose leases.

(1 January 2019) IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and the related interpretations.

Amendments to IFRS 2 These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis.


_Classification and measurement of share-_
_based payments_

(1 January 2018)


The amendments describe the accounting treatment of:

- the effects of vesting conditions and non-vesting conditions on
the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments:
measurement of the liability for cash-settled share-based
payments follows the same approach as used for equity-settled
share-based payments;

- share-based payments subject to withholding tax: the sharebased payment is qualified as equity-settled in its entirety
(including the withholding tax) provided that, in the absence of the
withholding tax, the share-based payment would have been
equity-settled in its entirety;

- modifications of share-based payment transactions from cashsettled to equity-settled: the original liability recognised in respect
of the cash-settled share-based payment is derecognised and the
equity-settled share-based payment is recognised at the
modification date fair value, with the difference between the two
amounts recognised in profit or loss.


Amendments to IAS 12 These amendments will be applicable on a retrospective basis.

_Recognition of deferred tax assets for_ The amendments clarify certain principles applicable to the
_unrealised losses_ recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt

instruments measured at fair value. They are designed to address
(1 January 2017) the diversity in practice around this issue.

Amendments to IAS 7 These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis.


These amendments require entities to provide additional
disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate

_Disclosure initiative_ changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including

both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. To
fulfil this obligation, entities will be required to provide disclosures
on the following changes in liabilities arising from financing
activities: (a) changes from financing cash flows; (b) changes
arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other
(1 January 2017) businesses; (c) the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates;
(d) changes in fair values; and (e) other changes.

**Standard**

**(application date for the Group subject** **Description of the standard**
**to adoption by the EU)**

Amendments to IAS 40 These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis.

These amendments provide guidance on transfers to or from
_Transfers of investment property_
investment properties. In addition, the list of evidence of a change
of use has been designated as a non-exhaustive list of examples.
(1 January 2018)

Companies will be allowed to apply this interpretation either
IFRIC 22
retrospectively or prospectively.

_Foreign currency transactions and advance_ IFRIC 22 provides guidance on interpreting IAS 21 –The Effects
_consideration_ of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates

It clarifies the exchange rate to be used for advance
(1 January 2018) consideration.

IFRS Annual Improvements Cycles These amendments will be applicable retrospectively.


The main standards concerned are:
_2014-2016 cycle_

                        - IFRS 12 –Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities

(1 January 2017) for amendments to IFRS 12

                         - IAS 28 –Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
(1 January 2018)

The adoption of IFRS 16 will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases stores and
warehouses and will result in the recognition of almost all leases on balance sheet. An optional exemption exists
for short-term and low-value leases assets. The standard removes the current distinction between operating and
financing leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability to
pay rentals for virtually all lease contracts. Operating lease expense will be replaced with financial interest and
depreciation, so key metrics like trading profit and EBITDA will change. The Group believes that the consolidated
income statement will also be affected because the total rental expense is generally higher at the beginning of the
lease that is to say, a decreasing charge, unlike a straight-line charge under the current standard. Additionally,
operating cash flows will be higher as cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability and attached
interest will be classified within financing activities.
The Group has started an initial assessment of the potential impact on the Group’s financial information. As at
31 December 2016, the Group has off-balance sheet non-cancellable operating lease commitments (properties
and equipment) of €2,514 million (see note 7.3) which mainly corresponds to properties, such as stores and
warehouses used in its business that it does not own. However, given that the Group is still in an early
assessment phase, it has not yet determined to what the extension (renewal or termination options) of its noncancellable operating lease commitments (particularly the existence of the right of termination in the three-year
commercial leases in France and the possibility to terminate lease arrangement in Brazil on payment of limited
penalty of one to twelve months of rent) will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for future payments
and how this will affect the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows.
IFRS 16 is mandatory for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The standard does not require
a full retrospective application but allows a “simplified approach”. Full retrospective application is optional. At this
stage, the Group has not yet decided which transition approach to apply.
Finally, group has not yet decided as to the date of first application of the standard or to the method of transition,
namely a retrospective approach simplified or full retrospective.

The other amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the Group's consolidated financial
statements.

###### Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements Year ended December 31, 2016

(Free translation of a French language original)

_This is a free translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report issued in the French language and is provided_
_solely for the convenience of English-speaking readers. This report includes information specifically required by_
_French law in such reports, whether qualified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the_
_consolidated financial statements and includes explanatory paragraphs discussing the auditors’ assessments of_
_certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were made for the purpose of issuing an audit_
_opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on_
_individual account captions or on information taken outside the consolidated financial statements._

_This report, should be read in conjunction with, and is construed in accordance with French law and professional_
_auditing standards applicable in France._

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders' meeting, we hereby
report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2016, on:

  - the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Casino, GuichardPerrachon;

  - the justification of our assessments;

  - the specific verification required by French law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

**I. - Opinion on the consolidated financial statements**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2016 and of the results
of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to Note 1.3 to the financial statements
entitled “Restatement of comparative information”, which sets out the restatements of the
comparative information in the consolidated income statement, in respect of discontinued
operations and the change in method of presenting the costs of the non-recourse factoring of
receivables.


-----

**II. - Justification of assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de
_Commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the_
following matters:

**_Non current assets_**

The Group is required to make estimates based on assumptions regarding impairment tests of
goodwill and other non current assets as described in the note 10.5 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The recoverable value of non current assets is estimated using
notably cash flow and earnings projections contained in the Group’s long-range business plans
approved by the management. We examined the consistency of assumptions, the data underlined
to these ones and available documentation. Based on those, we assessed the reasonableness of
the Group’s estimates. We have also validated that the note 10.5 of the note of the consolidated
financial statements provides appropriate information about these matters.

**_Provisions_**

The Group recognises provisions based on assumptions in order to address risks, as described in
the note 13 “Provisions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our work
consisted of a review of the data and assumptions on which were made these estimations and of
a review of the calculations. We have also validated the fact that the note 13 to the financial
statements provides appropriate information about these matters.

**_Assets held for sale and discontinued operations_**

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations are presented and measured according to the
procedures described in Note 3.5 to the consolidated financial statements. Our work consisted in
assessing the validity of the presentation of the operations concerned and of the related assets
and liabilities in the consolidated accounts, and to make sure of the reasonableness of the data
and assumptions used as a basis for the measurement of the fair value of the assets involved. We
also verified that Note 3.5 to the consolidated financial statements includes the appropriate
disclosure.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole and, therefore, contributed to our audit opinion expressed in the first part of this
report.


-----

**III. - Specific verification**

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable
in France the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.
