The absence of such terminology does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, competition in areas of our business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which we operate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.

In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

In accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, our business is organized according to the following reporting segments: - Our _France Retail_ segment includes our French retail banners (including online sales associated with such banners, but excluding Cdiscount), our ancillary business activities in France (including GreenYellow, relevanC and ScaleMax) and our Indian Ocean operations, which were sold in June 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our France Retail segment generated €15,219 million in net sales. - Our E-commerce segment consists of our Cdiscount online retail business, which we hold through our 78.9% economic interest (as of December 31, 2020) in Cnova N.V. and which is fully consolidated in our financial statements. References to the financial performance of Cdiscount in this Offering Memorandum refer to Casino’s E-commerce reporting segment.

GPA and Grupo Éxito are fully consolidated in our financial statements based on our assessment that we have de facto control of GPA since (i) the remainder of GPA’s shares are held by widely-dispersed shareholders and (ii) a majority of GPA’s board of directors are directors we have nominated. Following the spin-off of Assaí, which was approved by GPA shareholders on December 31, 2020, we now also hold 41.2% of the capital and voting rights of Assaí, and we have maintained the full consolidation of the results of Assaí in our financial statements for periods commencing on or after January 1, 2021.

During the periods under review in this Offering Memorandum, we have carried out a number of significant disposals, and as a result, we have, in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, classified certain assets as held for sale and classified income generated by certain businesses as attributable to discontinued operations. In addition, the presentation of our consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows as of December 31, 2018 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of Leader Price within discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 and the final purchase price allocation for Sarenza.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2914,MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) MAY,2914.10,in this Offering Memorandum,2914.10.1,IFRS 16 – Leases,"IFRS 16 – Leases, which the IASB published in January 2016 and which became mandatory for companies reporting in IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases, and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are recognized. Short term leases and low value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of the expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs. We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we applied the full retrospective transition approach and have restated all comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. In December 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published its decision on (i) determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease or a lease that can be terminated by either of the parties with no contractual penalty and (ii) the link between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. This decision provides clarifications that may impact the term of leases other than the particular cases mentioned. In light of this decision, on July 3, 2020, the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables or the “ANC”) issued a new position statement regarding French commercial leases that are described as “3-6-9” leases, because such leases are signed for at least nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years. This statement superseded the ANC’s previous position statement of February 16, 2018. Subsequent to the issuance of such position statement, we performed a further analysis of our leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected by the ANC’s position statement. As a result of such further analysis, the Group revised its accounting treatment of certain lease contracts to reflect an increased estimated term for the following leases: leases that automatically renew or are terminable at any time; and assets under lease (stores, warehouses), including non-removable leasehold improvements, the residual net carrying amount of which at the end of the estimated lease term pursuant to the IFRS 16 standard may constitute a significant penalty (within the meaning of the decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee) for the Group. The revised accounting treatment of such leases resulted in a changed presentation beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which included a restated presentation of the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not, however, restate our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. For a further discussion of this decision, see notes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum. xv ----- In 2019, we reviewed the presentation of costs to obtain contracts in our statement of financial position. Costs to obtain contracts, previously included in other current and non-current assets, have been included in other intangible assets in our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. We believe that this voluntary change of presentation improves the quality of our financial disclosures as it reflects the way in which this investment – related to the management of our franchise – is itself managed (i.e., as though we had acquired an intangible asset (the customer relationship)). In our income statement, costs to obtain contracts are now recognized over the term of the contract as an amortization expense within selling expenses and no longer as an expense within cost of goods sold. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to €39 million (including the portion relating to Leader Price as a discontinued operation). The reclassification qualifies as a change of method and has therefore been applied retrospectively to 2018 in our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 as if the new presentation had been adopted as of the beginning of those periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

We have applied IFRIC 23 as from January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method (that is, without a restatement of comparative information). The application of this interpretation did not result in any significant changes to the measurement of uncertain tax balances as of December 31, 2018.

The information presented by Non-IFRS Measures is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS. We define the Non-IFRS Measures as follows: - **Underlying net profit/(loss), Group share corresponds to net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, adjusted for (i) the impact of other operating income and expenses, (ii) the impact of non-recurring financial items, (iii) income tax expense/benefit related to these adjustments, (iv) the application of IFRIC 23 – Uncertainties about Tax Treatment and (v) minority interests in underlying profit/(loss) (as defined below). Non-recurring financial items include changes in the fair value of equity derivatives (such as total return swaps and forward contracts on CBD shares) and the effects of discounting tax liabilities in Brazil. - **Minority interests in underlying profit/(loss)** represent the share of underlying net profit/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests. This indicator is therefore equal to net profit from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for non xvi ----- recurring financial items, as well as income tax expense/benefits related to these adjustments and the application of IFRIC 23 – Uncertainties about Tax Treatment (see the definition of underlying net profit/loss, Group share). The Group uses underlying net profit/(loss), Group share and minority interests in underlying profit/(loss) to measure changes in recurring profit from operations. - **Free cash flow after lease payments** is defined by the Group as EBITDA less lease payments, change in working capital, income taxes and gross capital expenditures, excluding certain non-recurring items such as the Rocade Plan and the Asset Disposal Plan. Free cash flow after lease payments is presented before (i) the payment of dividends to shareholders and holders of CGP’s Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes and (ii) financial expenses other than payments of interest on lease liabilities. - **Free cash flow before lease payments is defined by the Group as EBITDA less change in working capital, income taxes and net capital expenditures, excluding (in the case of our France Retail segment) certain non-recurring items such as the Rocade Plan and the Asset Disposal Plan. We presented this measure on a Group-level prior to the year ended December 31, 2020. Free cash flow before lease payments is presented before (i) the payment of dividends to shareholders and holders of CGP’s Existing Deeply Subordinated Perpetual Notes and (ii) financial expenses. The Group uses free cash flow before and after lease payments to measure cash flow arising from and used in operating activities. Management believes that such free cash flow indicators thus defined provide investors with additional perspective on cash flow available for debt repayments and acquisitions, after accounting for net capital expenditures to support ongoing business operations, interest on borrowings and long-term value creation. Free cash flow is used to measure Group performance and overall liquidity. - **Gross capital expenditure, a component of free cash flow after lease payments, corresponds to “Cash outflows related to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property”, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. - **Net capital expenditure, a component of free cash flow before lease payments, corresponds to gross capital expenditure less “Cash inflows related to disposals of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property”, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. - **Trading profit is defined as operating profit before other operating income and expenses. Other operating income and other operating expenses include (i) certain items which, by definition, are not included in an assessment of a business unit’s recurring operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses on non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope of consolidation (for example, transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from disposals of subsidiaries, remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests) and (ii) certain non-recurring items that would distort analyses of the Group’s recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are limited in number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs (such as reorganization costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions and expenses for litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments). For the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, which are presented on a post-IFRS xvii ----- leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and depreciation of the right-of-use asset. - **EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortization expenses included in trading profit (but excluding impairment of inventories and trade receivables, other receivables and provisions for litigation and risks included in trading profit). For the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, which are presented on a post-IFRS 16 basis, EBITDA does not include lease expenses except for variable lease expenses and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. - **Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA for the France (including E-commerce) and Latam Retail perimeters, as those perimeters are defined in the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, pursuant to which the main adjustment is the inclusion of certain entities (including Segisor) in France Retail and E-commerce, and their exclusion from Latam Retail. - **Adjusted EBITDA including leases corresponds to Adjusted EBITDA less the repayment of lease liabilities and interest paid on lease liabilities. - **Gross debt is defined as loans and other borrowings, less (i) financial assets arising from a significant disposal of non-current assets (including proceeds from certain asset disposals that have been deposited into the segregated accounts that have been established in accordance with the provisions of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture), (ii) financial assets held for cash management purposes and as short-term investments and (iii) derivatives with a positive fair value designated as fair value hedges. - **Adjusted gross debt is defined as gross debt for the France (including E-commerce) and Latam Retail perimeters, as those perimeters are defined in the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, pursuant to which the main adjustment is the inclusion of certain entities (including Segisor) in France Retail and E-commerce, and their exclusion from Latam Retail. - **Net debt** is defined as gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Unless otherwise indicated, adjusted net debt is presented before the impact of IFRS 5. - **Adjusted net debt is defined as net debt for the France (including E-commerce) and Latam Retail perimeters, as those perimeters are defined in the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, pursuant to which the main adjustment is the inclusion of certain entities (including Segisor) in France Retail and E-commerce, and their exclusion from Latam Retail. Unless otherwise indicated, adjusted net debt is presented before the impact of IFRS 5. - **Same-store sales** is defined as described in “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations—Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth—Same-Store Growth”. xviii ----- of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations—Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth—Organic Growth”. - **Gross merchandise volume (“GMV”), with respect to our E-commerce segment, corresponds to sales, including tax, made directly on Cdiscount’s websites and by independent marketplace merchants. We present Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they provide additional information that is useful to the market when analyzing the Group’s underlying trends, as well as its performance and financial position. These indicators are also used by management to analyze performance. As they are not defined in any IFRS standard, they are not directly comparable with indicators with similarly titled measures reported by other companies. They are not intended to replace the IFRS indicators presented in the financial statements, nor should they be seen as more important. Certain of the Non-IFRS Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties subject to change, and they may differ from actual results for the relevant period. In addition, the preparation of such Non-IFRS Measures requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts presented for such Non-IFRS Measures in this Offering Memorandum. Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our businesses or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading major multi-format, multi-banner and multi-channel retailer with over 120 years of history, offering a diverse range of products and services to customers primarily located in France and, through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America. We offer both brand-name and private label food and consumer products through traditional retail stores as well as e-commerce food and non-food websites and apps. We also provide business-to-business and business-to-consumer services through our portfolio of complementary lines of business. Our retail banners operate under formats which aim to adapt to current consumer trends and needs across the various geographies in which we operate. Our premium retail format offers many innovative services and a high-quality shopping experience. Our convenience retail format is adapted to both city centers and rural areas, offering everyday basics to meet the expectations of customers seeking quality, authenticity and service. Our hypermarket, cash & carry and discount retail formats offer a wide range of quality products at affordable prices. We believe most of our banners enjoy leading market positions in most of our markets. We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed an omni-channel offering that we believe has favorably positioned us to respond to evolving consumer trends. We have developed partnerships with leading innovators such as Amazon and Ocado in order to provide best-in-class digital offer and grocery delivery services in France, as well as with Uber Eats and Deliveroo. We also offer customers in France hundreds of stores with autonomous solutions that provide a convenient and seamless retail experience, allowing customers to shop in the evening or on Sunday without the need to go through a physical checkout. Our pure-play e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, is the second largest non-food e-tailer in France by number of unique monthly visitors (“UMV”) and has allowed us to offer a range of adjacent business-to-consumer and business-to-business services. In France, Brazil and Colombia, our brick-and-mortar retail banners benefit from mobile applications and other e-commerce functionality that allow us to provide targeted promotions to our customers and give our customers the flexibility to shop how they want, when they want. We have developed a number of other complementary business lines that allow us to use our knowhow while monetizing our asset base. Through our subsidiary, GreenYellow, we have become a leader in photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency with a diverse customer portfolio and an expanding platform of innovative energy solutions. In addition, these businesses also include real estate development and shopping center management, consumer finance and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via relevanC and ScaleMax, respectively. 1 ----- We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other international markets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €31,912 million in net sales and €2,742 million in EBITDA and our France Retail and E-commerce segments recorded net sales of €17,256 million and EBITDA of €1,580 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,"Leading position in the French food retail market through structurally well-positioned formats, attractive consumer offering and digitalization","We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of a number of favorable consumer trends in French food retail as an already established market leader positioned in dynamic geographic areas and growing market segments that have shown resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hold leading positions in the French food retail market, the largest grocery retail market in Western Europe in terms of retail sales value (“RSV”) (based on partial-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate and with retail sales value measured by retail selling price, excluding sales tax), according to Euromonitor International. The RSV of the French grocery retail market (in nominal terms and applying a constant 2020 exchange rate) has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% between 2015 and 2020, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 0.3% between 2020 and 2025. The graph below shows the growth in the RSV of the French grocery retail market from 2015 to 2020, as well as the RSV and its historical growth rate in the German, British and Spanish grocery retail markets, and their respective projected growth rates between 2020 and 2025 (Source: Euromonitor International Limited, Retailing 2021 Edition, based on retail sales _value measured by retail selling price excluding sales tax, at a fixed 2020 euro exchange rate and constant value terms.)_ (1) Source: Euromonitor International Limited, Retailing, 2021 Edition, based on retail sales value measured by retail selling price, excluding sales tax, at a fixed euro exchange rate, 2020 constant prices. 2020 estimates are based on partial-year information. 2 ----- According to Euromonitor International, we are the fifth-largest modern grocery retailer in France, with a market share of approximately 9.6% in 2020 (Source: Euromonitor International Limited Retailing _Edition, based on retail sales value by global brand owner and part-year information at a fixed euro exchange rate). As of December 31, 2020, we had a network of 7,634 stores in France within a diversified_ portfolio of complementary banners, each with different strategies to meet changing consumer expectations. Our portfolio of banners in France is particularly focused on convenience and premium formats, which accounted for 54.6% of our net France Retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and address growing demand from French consumers. Approximately 69% of our France Retail net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated in three of the fastest growing regions of France – the Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and ProvenceAlpes-Côte d’Azur regions – whose combined population accounted for 39% of the total French population and approximately 49% of France’s GDP growth according to the latest data available for 2019. As of the end of 2020, we had more than 1,300 stores in the Paris area, whose population accounted for roughly 19% of the French population as of December 31, 2020. The map below shows the percentage of our France Retail net sales generated by each of these key regions as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we are the major French food retailer with the smallest exposure to the declining hypermarket format, which accounted for 25% of our France Retail net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Finally, we offer a large range of organic and free of pesticide products and intend to further use our specialized Naturalia stores to develop broad organic offerings across all of our banners. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we had approximately €1.3 billion in net sales from organic products, up from approximately €1.1 billion in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020, our organic sales represented 9.5% of our total France Retail net sales, reflecting growth of 12% compared to the prior year. The table below shows the expected CAGR of the French grocery RSV for different formats between 2020 and 2025, the position of our various formats and banners within the French market and their contribution to our French Retail net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. 3 ----- (1) As of December 31, 2020.

(3) Convenience segment includes other activities, which mainly includes Vindémia, which was sold in June 2020. (4) Ranking based on Euromonitor Convenience Store category. Casino banners classified as Convenience stores by Euromonitor include Leader Price Express, Monop’ Station, Daily Monop’, Sherpa, Vival, Monop’, Casino Shop and Le Petit Casino. There is no available market share information on organic formats. As a result we believe that our market share in the Proxi and premium segments are therefore underestimated. We also include the SPAR banner in the Convenience store category. although Euromonitor does not consider it as part of its GBO rankings, only as part of its National Brand Owner rankings. (5) Hypermarket statistics for Casino exclude Cdiscount counter shops. (6) Rankings based on Euromonitor Supermarkets category. Casino banners classified as supermarkets by Euromonitor international include Monoprix, Franprix and Casino supermarkets. (7) “Convenience store & other” forecast growth refers to Euromonitor’s forecast growth for the Convenience category only. We believe that the French food retail market is characterized by a number of demographic characteristics that are favorable for food retailers like our Group. These trends include a growing and aging French population, as well as increasing urbanization favoring retailers that have a highly concentrated network of stores in towns and cities. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly leaning toward high-quality, organic goods, leading to a stronger emphasis on the premium end of the market, in particular in dynamic regions. We believe this is favorable for retailers like us, with a diverse range of banners and an already strong position in sales of organic products. Growth in the French food retail market is moderate, but marked by a strong polarization of format performance, with convenience store net sales expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2020 and 2025, supermarket net sales expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.0% and hypermarket net sales (Source: _Euromonitor, based on retail sales value measured by retail selling price excluding sales tax, 2020 constant value terms) expected to decline by a CAGR of 1.2% between 2020 and 2025. In light of our strong focus_ on the convenience and premium formats and our low exposure to the hypermarket format, which has 4 ----- further been reduced in recent years, we expect to benefit from the trends favoring supermarkets and convenience formats when compared with our main competitors. We are currently focusing on business growth in our convenience formats in urban areas (including Franprix and Naturalia) and semi-urban and rural areas (including Spar, Vival and Casino Shop), with 100 store openings targeted in the first quarter of 2021 and 200 in the second quarter of 2021. We are also pursuing the development of non-food corners, particularly through our partnerships offering Hema, Cdiscount and Decathlon products in Franprix stores, which have been integrated into 210, 66 and 22 stores, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. We have further enhanced our brick and mortar French food retail operations with a number of digital initiatives. For example, each of our principal French retail banners has a mobile application enabling customers to do their shopping or monitor their loyalty card online. Furthermore, we have implemented a number of digital solutions to enhance our customers’ shopping experience, such as integrating mobile payments, digital receipts and scan-and-go solutions through the Monoprix and Casino Max mobile apps. Purchases by Casino Max app holders accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales in hypermarkets and supermarkets in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our banners’ apps also allow individual marketing capabilities, with personalized, targeted coupons and discounts, which we believe is a key distinguishing factor from most of our competitors. Innovation is also central to the development of our Casino Supermarkets banner. In 2018, the banner opened a unique store concept in Paris, “Le 4 Casino”, combining physical and digital retail and a place to relax and socialize. Casino Supermarkets are rapidly developing omni-channel and e-commerce initiatives, such as drive & collect, click & collect or home delivery. We also work constantly to enhance the customer experience through the roll-out of new digital solutions, particularly through the Casino Max app, which covers our supermarket, hypermarket and convenience networks. As of December 31, 2020, 533 of our stores had autonomous solutions (compared to 305 as of the end of 2019), enabling them to operate without the presence of full retail staff, including in the evening and on Sundays. In 2020, digitalization of our customer experience further increased with 61% of payments at hypermarkets and 48% of payments at supermarkets carried out by smartphone or automatic checkout. Our strategic positioning has enabled us to take advantage of consumer trends in the French food retail market that have been accelerated by the two initial lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. We believe that the concurrent social distancing measures and government-imposed lockdowns boosted athome consumption as individuals increasingly worked from home and reduced restaurant dining, resulting in strong growth in demand for food retailing in the first half of 2020, particularly for the Group’s proximity formats (convenience and urban stores) and food retail sales through e-commerce channels. As an omnichannel retailer, we have been able to benefit from a first-mover advantage in addressing increased customer demand for food retail e-commerce offerings, which we believed already had the potential to grow significantly in France and demonstrated increased growth as a result of the lockdowns and social distancing measures put in place to confront the health crisis. In 2020, demand on our food e-commerce sites was particularly high. Food e-commerce sales generated triple-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020 with the deployment of click & collect and home delivery solutions in urban and convenience formats. Food e-commerce orders were up by 50% from approximately 6,500 orders per day before the crisis to approximately 10,000 orders per day at the end of the first half of 2020. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Best-in-class food and non-food e-commerce platform,"We believe that our Group has one of the most comprehensive e-commerce offerings among retailers in France, including as a French leader in non-food e-commerce through our subsidiary, Cdiscount. _Food e-commerce innovator_ As a pioneer in food e-commerce, we have developed significant expertise in home delivery by forging broad and strategic partnerships with leaders in the sector, enabling us to provide best-in-class home delivery solutions through a profitable e-commerce model with lower preparation costs. These partnerships cover two different market segments: next-day delivery for a wide range of products and express delivery in under two hours for a select range of products. Our expertise in next-day delivery has been facilitated by the exclusive partnership that began in 2017 between Monoprix and Ocado, pursuant to which an automated warehouse based on Ocado technology, the Casino O’logistique warehouse, was built in early 2020. The Casino O’logistique warehouse, which began operating in March 2020 and opened for public orders in May 2020, is designed to prepare and provide next-day delivery of Monoprix shopping baskets in Paris and areas of the Île-deFrance region covering approximately 93% of that region’s population. We believe we can generate up to approximately €500 million in annual sales per warehouse, offering customers approximately 50,000 SKUs. This disruptive and internationally sought after technology can prepare a basket of 50 items in only six minutes, offering Monoprix and Casino online customers a vast assortment of food products and the very best in service and affordability. In addition, on September 30, 2020, the O’logistique warehouse extended its activity to customers of Casino Supermarkets and Géant Casino banners. Our e-commerce offering was enhanced in 2018 with the beginning of a partnership with Amazon for express delivery of a select range of products within two hours for customers in Paris. This partnership has expanded to allow Amazon Prime Now customers access to a wide offering from Monoprix and Naturalia, as well as a large range of our Casino private-label items. As of December 31, 2020, the Monoprix store available on Amazon Prime Now included more than 7,000 items, including approximately 2,000 private-label products, and the Naturalia store on Amazon Prime Now included approximately 2,000 products. This delivery option has also expanded geographically, covering the Greater Paris Region, the Côte d’Azur (Nice and surrounding towns), Lyon and Bordeaux. In addition, we offer a full range of local home delivery options, click & collect and drive-up services across our different banners. _Cdiscount: a national champion in non-food e-commerce_ Through our Cdiscount subsidiary, we are the second largest player in non-food e-commerce in France. Cdiscount is a subsidiary of our e-commerce unit, Cnova, in which we directly hold an approximately 65% economic interest. With more than 22 million UMVs on average over the third quarter of 2020, and a record-high 26.2 million UMVs in December 2020, Cdiscount has achieved critical mass, meaning it is able to gradually shift from exclusively B2C operations to a business model more oriented toward the B2B market, due to the development of its marketplace. This transition is a key factor in developing Cdiscount’s profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Cdiscount’s GMV reached €4,207 million, up 7.9% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Cdiscount also generated EBITDA of €133 million, contributing €129 million to the Group’s consolidated EBITDA for the year. 6 ----- Cdiscount features a wide array of products, with more than 100 million product offerings, including in the home appliances, furniture, IT and culture categories. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Cdiscount marketplace represented 44% of its GMV, with accelerated growth in the second half of the year. We currently target a Cdiscount marketplace share above 50% of GMV in the medium-term. Cdiscount also offers an expanding range of services for individuals, including holiday packages, ticketing, energy plans, as well as health and financial services. Cdiscount is continuing to expand its international coverage, which already includes 27 countries in Europe. In 2019, Cdiscount entered into an alliance with three other European marketplaces, called the International Marketplace Network (IMN), to synchronize marketplace merchant offers and strengthen expansion outside France, giving Cdiscount access to roughly 230 million customers. Furthermore, Cdiscount is also developing a turnkey marketplace solution for retailers and e-merchants to address European e-commerce websites.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Track record of growth and value creation from new businesses,"To effectively respond to market changes, we continuously adjust our model and have developed new adjacent activities with strong growth prospects that complement our business as a retailer. These activities fall into two categories: energy, through our specialized subsidiary, GreenYellow, and data and data centers, through our subsidiaries relevanC and ScaleMax. _Photovoltaic power and energy efficiency: GreenYellow_ In 2007, we launched a new business in photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency through our subsidiary, GreenYellow, which capitalizes on our expertise in the real estate sector through our property development, construction and operation activities, as well as the favorable geographic location of our stores, mainly those located in sunny regions. Initially dedicated to managing internal energy costs, particularly through the roll-out of photovoltaic systems on the rooftops and in the car parks of our hypermarkets and supermarkets, the business has gradually developed to offer a wide range of energy solutions for external customers, benefitting from strong green energy momentum. It has three areas of expertise: the installation of photovoltaic plants and solar energy production, energy efficiency solutions and energy monitoring services. GreenYellow’s cross-cutting expertise, from both an ecological and economic standpoint, means it is able to provide its private and public customers with a wide range of solutions to produce, manage and optimize their energy consumption. Although GreenYellow is primarily positioned in France, it has extensive operations in 17 different countries outside France throughout Latin America, Asia and Africa. GreenYellow’s customer portfolio is diverse, offering services to a broad range of customers, including public authorities, private players and individuals. It offers an expanding and wide platform of innovative solutions, such as direct-to-customer natural gas offerings to Cdiscount customers, energy efficiency contracts signed with retailers in Brazil, a floating 6 MWp solar power plant in Thailand, a 1.5 MWp project completed in Cambodia and a hybrid system of solar power generation in Africa. GreenYellow has become a leading energy operator and intends to position itself as the green energy partner of choice for companies and public authorities. In order to further ramp up its development, in 2018, GreenYellow opened its capital to external investors Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance through a €150 million capital increase, following which they now together hold 24% of GreenYellow’s capital. In addition, in 2018, GreenYellow created a joint venture with Engie named Reservoir Sun, dedicated to solar self-consumption for businesses and municipalities in France, and in 2019, signed a new partnership agreement with Allego to deploy France’s largest network of ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations. 7 ----- In the first half of 2020, GreenYellow continued to develop and expand, with the signing of its 100th photovoltaic contract in Thailand, as well as a new 12MWp photovoltaic contract in South Africa, a strategic growth geography for GreenYellow. Most recently, GreenYellow entered into an energy efficiency contract for a major South African food retailer for five of its retail stores. As of December 31, 2020, it benefited from a pipeline for projects equivalent to 565 MWp, an increase from 451 MWp as of December 31, 2019 and 200 MWp as of December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GreenYellow generated an EBITDA of €64 million, contributing €57 million to the Group’s consolidated EBITDA for the year. _Data and data centers: relevanC and ScaleMax_ We have access to targeted, high-quality customer data due to our vast network of brick-and-mortar stores and high volume of e-commerce customer traffic. We have developed a consistent monetization strategy for such data, which has become a key intangible asset for retailers looking to understand consumers’ tastes and aspirations, and to anticipate upcoming changes in consumer habits. In 2018, we created 3w.relevanC, a subsidiary dedicated to the consumer data business, specialized in three areas: analyzing purchasing behavior, activating advertising campaigns and measuring the impact of offline campaigns. In February 2020, 3w.relevanC combined with Maxit, our “digital factory” that focused on technology innovation for our various banners, to form relevanC, which has grown to be a key player in digital marketing. RelevanC provides brands and retailers with customer acquisition and retention solutions, based on targeting strategies and impact measurement, via two divisions: advertising and retail tech. RelevanC’s advertising division offers clients media and marketing solutions, enhanced by transactional data, insights and measurements, to help clients meet the multi-channel marketing challenges with their target shoppers, while the retail tech division offers clients technological solutions to enable them to optimize the performance of their marketing campaigns through the use of data to personalize the customer relationship. RelevanC is focused on developing strategic partnerships with key industry players, such as through its partnership with Orange Advertising, pursuant to which it measures the impact on of television advertising on customers’ buying habits. RelevanC has developed a platform enabling the Group’s banners and suppliers to personalize their promotional campaigns and a retail media platform that uses relevanC technology to enable suppliers and marketplace vendors to buy advertising space on sites of the Group or of third parties. RelevanC generated €55 million in net sales after its demerger from 3W in the year ended December 31, 2020. On a constant-perimeter basis, relevanC recorded a year-on-year increase of more than 50%. Additionally, in December 2018, we positioned ourselves on the cloud computing market through the creation of a joint venture, ScaleMax, alongside Qarnot Computing. ScaleMax aims to run newgeneration data centers in unused spaces, such as those located in warehouses and storerooms. ScaleMax opened its first data center in the Greater Paris region (Réau, Seine-et-Marne) in a Cdiscount warehouse. This business helps the Group generate revenue through the sale of computing power to a diversified client portfolio. In addition, the installed servers generate heat, which can be used to heat the buildings where they are housed. The green energy used to power these servers is managed by GreenYellow. Since its inception, ScaleMax has doubled its computing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, over 27,000 cores had already been deployed for customers other than Group entities. In addition, ScaleMax has secured contracts 8 ----- with a broad range of clients, including several banking clients, start-ups specialized in artificial intelligence and 3D animation studios. In 2020, ScaleMax continued its development through a series of strategic initiatives, including increased computation capacity through a new data center inside the Cdiscount warehouse in Verpilleux and the diversification of its customer base across various industries. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, ScaleMax was able to make computing capacity available to the Folding@home project for research against COVID-19.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,High-growth operations in attractive Latin American markets,"Through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, we have a highly developed network of retail banners in a number of attractive formats in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Uruguay. The Latin American business benefits from attractive markets with strong underlying macroeconomic trends, including a growing population of over 300 million, which is favorable for food retailers. As an established player in these markets, we believe we stand to benefit from the favorable demographics of these countries. Through the Latam Reorganization Transactions, we recently simplified our holding structure in Latin America to unlock further value in our Latin American business. Despite a high rate of urbanization, the penetration rate of modern grocery stores in these markets remains relatively low. As a result of this, as well as the rapid development in these countries of digitalization and urbanization rates, we expect rapid structural changes in the region. In this context, we believe that retail groups like ours with extensive digital know-how and omni-channel capabilities are well positioned to benefit from growth in Latin America, where digital media has had an extensive impact. In 2020, our Latin American businesses generated sales of €14.7 billion, with €6.1 billion in sales for Assaí, €3.6 billion for Grupo Éxito and €4.9 billion for the Multivarejo segment of GPA. In Brazil, GPA was the largest player in grocery retail and Assaí was one of the largest players in the cash & carry market in 2020, with net sales of €11,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 for GPA and Assaí combined. As of December 31, 2020, GPA and Assaí had a network of 1,507 stores throughout the country, through the Multivarejo and Assaí banners, respectively. GPA and Assaí are active across various formats, channels and regions of Brazil. As of March 8, 2021, the market value of Casino Group’s shares in GPA and Assaí was €1.6 billion (based on GPA’s and Assaí’s share prices and the spot foreign exchange rate between the euro and the Brazilian real on that date). In early 2021, we took a further step to increase our strategic focus and enhance valuation, through the spin-off of Assaí, which was listed on the Novo Mercado Segment of B3 – Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. (formerly BM&F Bovespa) stock exchange on March 1, 2021. In 2020, Assaí, which was then GPA’s cash & carry banner, was one of the country’s largest players in this segment based on market share, according to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2021 edition. Assaí has shown organic growth in net sales of 26% per annum in the last four years. Assaí continues to pursue the profitable expansion of stores, with 42 store openings in the two years ended December 31, 2020, and include 184 stores to date. GPA also conducts its retail business through its Multivarejo segment, offering customers a wide range of products and services through various formats and banners. In 2020, GPA’s hypermarkets showed strong development of online sales, as well as improved sales and gross margins, and GPA recorded an increase in EBITDA margin of 2.7 percentage points as compared to the end of 2019. 9 ----- GPA is also a pioneer in food e-commerce, digital transformation and innovation in Brazil. Its digital initiatives include: - James Delivery: In December 2018, GPA acquired 100% of the startup that operates the application James Delivery, a multiservice platform for ordering and delivering various products. As of December 31, 2020, James Delivery expanded its delivery service offering to 32 cities. - Digital loyalty program: The “My Discount” mobile application, which enables customers to access and use customized coupons, represents a large portion of GPA’s customers registered under loyalty programs. - Cheftime: At the end of 2018, GPA entered into a partnership with Cheftime, a foodtech startup that sells individual gastronomic kits and offers customers an online subscription service. Implemented under the Pão de Açúcar banner, Cheftime has exceeded initial expectations, in particular due to strong consumer demand for its rotisserie products. - Partnerships with startups: GPA has created an internal lab to reinforce its cooperation with startups and achieve increased speed and efficiency in its product launches. - Microsoft: GPA has entered into a partnership with Microsoft to design a new store model, with sensors capable of interacting with its banners’ digital platforms and additional features such as lockers, facial recognition and self-checkout. - Stix Fidelidade: GPA has entered into a coalition with Raia Drogasil, a leading Brazilian drugstore retailer, to further strengthen and broaden its customers’ power of choice by offering customers the ability to purchase products and services to accumulate or redeem points. In the second half of 2020, Stix Fidelidade served more than 60 million of GPA and Raia Drogasil’s loyal customers. We operate in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina through Grupo Éxito, which generated €3,637 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Grupo Éxito operated a network of 2,101 stores, with a diverse range of formats and innovative propositions. Grupo Éxito also offers consumers a complementary offering of financial services and consumer finance options through its finance joint venture Tuya. Finally, Grupo Éxito has successfully leveraged its significant real estate holdings by launching and growing a commercial property development business, Viva Malls, the largest commercial property developer in Colombia, with approximately 758,000 square meters of gross leasable area (“GLA”), including 17 shopping centers and 17 outdoor malls as of December 31, 2020. In Colombia, where Grupo Éxito is the leading modern grocery retailer (according to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2021 Edition), Grupo Éxito has launched several initiatives in relation to food ecommerce, digitalization and innovation. These initiatives include: - Mobile applications: The Éxito and Carulla banners launched mobile applications in the first quarter of 2019 that enable customers to access customized coupons. In the third quarter of 2020, App Annie ranked the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications as the second most downloaded applications for online food shopping in Colombia in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these applications had been downloaded nearly two million times. 10 ----- - Rappi: Grupo Éxito has entered into a strategic partnership with Rappi, a delivery service startup, to improve its delivery services. - Carulla Smart Market: In December 2019, Grupo Éxito launched Carulla SmartMarket, the first smart retail store in Colombia, providing nearly twenty high-tech shopping experiences, such as facial recognition payment, an electronic sommelier and fully digital shopping experience. Grupo Éxito, through its banners Devoto, Disco and Géant, is a leading food retailer in Uruguay. Although Grupo Éxito offers a range of different formats in Uruguay, it has particularly focused its expansion efforts on its Devoto Express convenience stores. In addition, Grupo Éxito has implemented an operational excellence program in order to boost productivity and counteract the effects of inflation on operating expenses. As a result of such efforts, Grupo Éxito’s Uruguayan operations are highly profitable, with a 10.3% EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, as published by Grupo Éxito. In Argentina, the Libertad banners are present in the Córdoba region, with 25 hypermarkets and convenience stores. In line with its dual retail and real estate business strategy, Libertad continues to seek opportunities to optimize its real estate portfolio, with a total GLA of approximately 170,000 square meters in 15 shopping centers as of December 31, 2020, making Libertad the third-largest real estate player in Argentina. Libertad’s shopping centers had an occupancy rate of 90% for the year ended December 31, 2020, with 96.2% of its tenants being local small- and medium-sized businesses, which is higher than the average recorded by local competitors.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,Rated best-in-class for ESG commitments,"Our commitment to ESG has been recognized by a number of leading ESG rating agencies. In December 2020, Vigeo Eiris ranked our Group as the number one European retailer for its ESG policy and commitments, selecting us as first out of 129 French companies for our climate and environmental protection commitments, human resources policies, corporate governance and employee relations and human resources policies. In addition, in October 2020, we were the only retailer in the Wall Street Journal’s list of the world’s top 100 most sustainably managed companies. With an AA overall rating, we were also in the top quartile of MSCI’s ESG scores in global food retail & staples. We have also received top ESG scores by FTSE4Good (4/5), RobecoSAM (70/100), Sustainalytics (72/100) and CDP (B). As a group that is committed to a sustainable retail model, our ESG policies are particularly important to us. We seek constant improvement in our non-financial performance in order to address the concerns of customers who are sensitive to the impact of their purchases. Our program gives us the foundation to build trusted relationships with our partners and suppliers, strengthen employee motivation and attract top talent. Since 2002, our commitment to sustainable development has been supported by a system of organization and governance involving managers at all levels of our Group, including the highest level of our management team. Our CSR department, which operates under and reports to the General Secretary of the Executive Committee, has rolled out the “CSR Spirit”, continuously improving our ESG program in France and abroad 11 ----- in coordination with the various subsidiary CSR departments. The below table presents a summary of our key ESG commitments. Group Ethics Charter United Nations Sustainable Paris Climate Agreement Development Goals (SDG) Universal Declaration of Eight fundamental conventions of Montreal Protocol Human Rights the ILO United Nations Global Compact UN Women’s Empowerment Science Based Targets (SBT) Principles _Our environmental commitment_ Determined to improve our environmental footprint, we were the first French retailer to adopt carbon emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative, which is led by the United Nations’ Global Compact and the WWF. Since 2015, we have also committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18% by 2025 as compared to 2015 (on a Group basis), and have already met this target in France, having reduced our emissions by 18% in 2020 alone, and 34% from 2015 to 2020. This performance is due in part to the activities of GreenYellow, our subsidiary and an energy efficiency and renewable energy expert. At Monoprix, we set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 as compared to 2020 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. We are also committed to reaching a target of 100% of reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging for our Casino private-label products by 2025. Moreover, part of our commitment to offering sustainable food to our consumers is to ensure sustainable sourcing. In 2020, we achieved our target of sourcing 100% of the palm oil used in our French private-label products from sources certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil. _Our commitment to promoting health and animal welfare_ We aim to offer healthy and sustainable food to all of our customers, including those with the lowest income. In addition to increasing our organic offering to approximately €1.3 billion in net sales in 2020, we have continued to strengthen our range of responsible products. Moreover, we have pledged to label all of our Casino private-label food products with Nutri-Scores by 2021. For many years now, we have been working closely with suppliers, local production chains and animal rights organizations in a commitment to offering products that are more respectful of animal welfare. To drive a cycle of continuous improvement, we cultivate dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including NGOs, veterinarians, suppliers, production chains, consumers and employees, in the hope that these initiatives will improve and broaden the array of animal-welfare friendly products on its store shelves and enable customers to enjoy better quality products made from more ethically treated animals. The chosen approach consists of both monitoring conditions in the breeding, transport and slaughtering process and supporting the production chains as they transition to better, more welfare-friendly practices. Our assertive commitment was recognized by the Business Benchmark on Animal Farm Welfare (BBFAW), which in 2019 rated our performance as Tier 3, at the top of French retailers on this issue. Consumer awareness plays a critical role in improving the treatment of farm animals, and to inform shoppers about the animal welfare aspects of the products they buy, we developed a labeling system in collaboration with three recognized animal rights organizations (including Compassion in World Farming), 12 |Group Ethics Charter|United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)|Paris Climate Agreement| |---|---|---| |Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Eight fundamental conventions of the ILO|Montreal Protocol| |United Nations Global Compact|UN Women’s Empowerment Principles|Science Based Targets (SBT)| ----- which will help to support standardized animal welfare labeling in France. The labels were initially prepared for broiler chickens, with the first labeled products appearing in stores in December 2018. At the beginning of 2020, the program was extended to other distributors and producers. _Our social commitment_ We have a longstanding commitment in favor of gender equality and diversity. In 2020, 52% of our 205,769 employees, and 40.4% of our Group-wide employees at the management level, were women (reflecting a 4.2 percentage point increase compared to 2015). In addition, in 2020, more than 8,460 of our employees were classified as having a disability, representing an increase of 27% compared to 2015 (in Brazil, this figure represents an increase of 108% since 2015). We are also committed to diversity in age, with 49% of our workforce between 30 to 50 years old, 37% under the age of 30 years old and 14% were 50 years old and over in 2020. We believe we are the first French retail group to be awarded the Equality and Diversity Label by the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR). We are also strongly committed to supporting the most vulnerable through our various charitable foundations. In 2020, our collection and donation initiatives resulted in the donation of nearly 18,800 tons of food products (equivalent to 37.6 million meals) to food banks or other social welfare organizations. In Brazil, GPA deploys a number of annual initiatives, inviting clients to donate food and products to social institutions. In 2020, GPA donated 993 tons of food and products, including 11,758 tons of food collected on Solidarity Day, GPA’s yearly initiative with over 100 partner organizations. Through the Éxito Foundation, Grupo Éxito also supports numerous initiatives to fight malnutrition in Colombia. During the COVID-19 crisis, we were fully engaged in both France and South America, donating two million masks to French hospitals and setting designated shopping hours for the elderly and healthcare professionals, among other initiatives. _Our governance commitment_ Our Board of Directors is strongly committed to diversity. Catherine Lucet, the lead independent Director, is also a member of the Audit Committee and Chair of the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee. There are no controlling shareholder representatives on any of our Board Committees. Further, 46% of our Board members are women. Our Board is strongly committed to its initiatives, as evidenced by the 10 meetings (97.9% attendance rate) and the 22 meetings of our committees (98.6% attendance rate) which took place in 2020.

We have demonstrated an ability to deliver on a number of ambitious asset disposal plans that we have launched in recent years. Beginning in 2018, following successive reviews of our business portfolio, we have undertaken the Asset Disposal Plan, pursuant to which we have set a cumulative goal of €4.5 billion in asset disposals in order to accelerate the completion of our strategic focus on attractive formats (including e-commerce, premium and convenience) and geographies, and on new businesses (such as energy, data and data centers). We have completed €2.8 billion in disposals as of December 31, 2020. The table below summarizes the disposals made under the Asset Disposal Plan as of December 31, 2020: 13 ----- In addition, in June 2018, we launched the Rocade Plan to dispose of or close loss making stores, particularly in our Géant Hypermarkets and Casino Supermarket formats. Store disposals and closures have allowed us to focus on our most profitable stores. The table below summarizes our valuable asset base. (1) 24% held by Tikehau and Bpifrance.

In addition to asset disposals, we have carried out in the past, and are continuing to carry out, a number of initiatives to improve our France Retail and E-commerce trading profit and free cash flow generation to support further reductions in our net debt. Such initiatives include reductions in operating costs, working capital and capital expenditures. With respect to our operating costs, such initiatives include cost-saving measures, the Rocade plan (whereby the disposal or closure of loss-making stores initiated in 2018 had an effect in the year ended December 31, 2020 of €43 million of non-recurring costs) and recurring savings from transformation plans initiated in the full-year 2020 (estimated at €60 million in the second half of 2020).

(2) Restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 16. Our capital expenditures primarily consist of the construction and remodeling of our stores, investments in digitalization and our infrastructure, including improvements to our information technology systems and our distribution facilities. We have completed major transformation programs, which led to a reduction of France Retail annual capital expenditures of over €200 million from 2018 to 2019, reflecting our capital expenditure control, with priority investments in digital activities and Monoprix. In France, including Cdiscount, gross capital expenditure increased from €437 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €505 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the accelerated store digitalization and the change in business model for GreenYellow. For 2021, we aim to control the levels of gross capital expenditure in the Group excluding GreenYellow, the development and transition of which to a companyowned asset model is intended to be financed primarily by its own resources. Our gross capital expenditure in France (including Cdiscount) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 is presented below. We have also pursued a business model at Cdiscount that we believe will drive profitability in addition to the strong fundaments behind e-commerce performance. These include increasing the share of marketplace contribution to GMV, improving margins on direct sales and launching a turnkey marketplace solution as a service offer to address the broader European market.

We aim to adjust our mix of formats to best position our business for long-term growth. We also aim to continue to expand our premium and convenience store formats which we believe will continue to be particularly promising over the medium term. We opened 169 premium and convenience stores in 2020, and we target 300 new store openings in the first half of 2021 (representing an acceleration and expansion of our previously stated goal of 300 new store openings for 2020 and 2021 cumulatively). In particular, to take advantage of consumers’ increased preference for organic products, we intend to develop our organic product offering in each of our banners and speed up the expansion of Naturalia, our 17 ----- organic specialized banner. Through this and the promotion of organic products through our digital distribution channels, including our partnership with Amazon Prime, we believe that our net sales of organic products will continue to increase over the next few years. We also plan to enhance our existing store network in France to meet changes in consumers’ tastes and needs. We intend to continue developing new concepts and services in our stores, such as the Monoprix Phénomène concept, a design store concept built in collaboration with Pixelis, Le Drugstore Parisien, a partnership with L’Oréal Paris, and Le 4 Casino, a phygital store with several digital innovations. In 2019, we launched a pilot store in Paris for a new concept, Darwin, a Franprix store offering consumers a host of conveniences, including full kitchen access, a large seating and dining area and the ability to shop for products from other brands, such as Cdiscount, Decathlon and home goods retailer Hema, in store. We also intend to provide catering services across our various banners, such as in-store salad bars and snack areas.

We intend to leverage favorable consumer trends and our strong experience in digital and omni-channel offerings by increasing our focus on efforts to expand our e-commerce activities in food retail, further developing our Cdiscount business, growing our digital customer relationships and rolling out further innovative concepts and solutions. Leveraging on the full deployment of our partnership with Ocado through the ramp up of a fully automated warehouse opened in March 2020 and with the expansion of the delivery area through which Amazon Prime customers can order Monoprix, Casino private-label and Naturalia products, we aim to further increase food e-commerce sales in the near to medium term. In our pure-play e-commerce business, we intend to continue to increase Cdiscount’s GMV through the further development of our marketplace, which we expect will account for an increasing share of Cdiscount’s GMV in the coming years. We also intend to further expand Cdiscount’s business-to-business and business-to-customer services offering within France, and to more generally expand Cdiscount’s operations to other European countries through direct delivery to countries neighboring France and the further development of partnerships with marketplaces abroad. As a result of the growth in its marketplace, Cdiscount has been able to shift its customer base to a model more oriented towards business clients and it intends to continue to focus on the development of their services for its clients. For example, Cdiscount is developing a turnkey marketplace service to address 900,000 European e-commerce websites. Finally, we aim to reinforce our digital customer relationships through the increased penetration of our banners’ mobile applications. In October 2018, we launched Le 4 Casino, the first store in France without a traditional cashier, the technology of which was deployed in 533 stores as of December 31, 2020, enabling them to operate autonomously in the evening and on Sundays without the presence of cashiers. In March 2019, we opened a logistics innovation lab in the Géant hypermarket in Pessac, France, where we test technology solutions in partnership with the most innovative startups in the field. Our innovation initiatives also include new activities with strong growth potential, such as the deployment of electrical vehicle charging stations in our parking lots. Each of these projects, in line with our asset-light strategy, have been developed in exclusive or limited partnerships with startups, franchisees with long-standing relationships with us or with other external specialist teams. 18 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In our solar energy business, we aim to further bolster our leadership position while developing newer activities. We aim to consolidate GreenYellow’s leadership position in solar energy with a target to increase its installed capacity, which has already grown significantly, with a pipeline representing 565 MWp of future projects as of December 31, 2020. We also aim to consolidate our leadership position in solar self-consumption in France by continuing to develop our joint venture partnership with Engie, pursuant to which we help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their electricity needs. Further, we plan to continue growing our energy performance contract offering, which is a contract with GreenYellow through which GreenYellow commits to achieve reductions in energy costs and total energy consumed, with external customers. To date, more than 2,600 customers have entered into such contracts. Finally, we intend to further develop our services and expand our offering through new projects such as the deployment of a network of ultra-fast vehicle charging stations, direct-to-consumer natural gas offerings and the development of new solar energy plants, such as the recently completed suspended solar energy plant on a rooftop in Thailand. We also plan to continue growing our data and data centers businesses, relevanC (which generated €55 million in net sales after its demerger from 3w in the year ended December 31, 2020) and ScaleMax, in order to increase the potential contribution from such businesses. We expect to target such growth through accelerating the development of relevanC’s customer base, as well as expanding the number of data center sites in our logistics warehouses and hypermarket stocking areas for our ScaleMax operations.

In Brazil, the strategy of GPA is centered on four key pillars: - Scale-up of GPA’s digital platform: GPA intends to increase its revenue by reinforcing and complementing its digital and e-commerce initiatives, particularly through the integration of its existing assets and new initiatives to benefit from the network effect created by the combination of a leading platform for food e-commerce in Brazil, a new marketplace platform, a newly created fulfillment platform (James and GPA Logistics), a loyalty platform (through the historical Cliente Mais and Clube Extra programs which have over 20 million members and 19 ----- the Stix program with over than 60 million members) and a monetization platform (media and insights). - Accelerated organic expansion of premium formats, such as Pão de Açúcar and Minuto Pão de Açúcar, in dense urban areas, while maintaining such formats’ high profitability level. - Growth of regional banners, including Mercado Extra and Compre Bem, through organic expansion, potential M&A opportunities and format development through strategic price positioning and a focus on fresh food categories and high-quality service. - Increase in the profitability of hypermarkets. In 2020, 23 GPA hypermarkets successfully migrated to a new value proposition based on three pillars: (i) competitiveness in grocery offerings, (ii) quality of fresh food categories, (ii) streamlining of non-food and specialty items. The remaining GPA 80 hypermarkets are also expected to migrate to this new value proposition by the end of 2021. The strategy of Assaí is to continue its accelerated expansion plan. Seven new stores are currently under construction, and three hypermarkets from Extra were transferred to Assaí before the conclusion of the spin-off to contribute to expansion of the brand. In addition, the Group has earmarked 40 plots of land in its portfolio for future store expansions of Assaí. We intend to continue Grupo Éxito’s transformation strategy by carrying out a number of different initiatives. - Focus on fast-growing formats: Grupo Éxito plans to expand the cash & carry format in Colombia through additional openings and conversion of existing stores into stores under the Surtimayorista banner. Grupo Éxito also intends to continue launching new concepts in Colombia, such as the Éxito WOW concept in its hypermarkets, which offers a complete revamp of its food and non-food product selection, and the FreshMarket concept in its Carulla premium supermarkets, with an improved selection of fresh and healthy products. - Digital transformation: Grupo Éxito believes that local market conditions are favorable for the development of omni-channel marketing solutions, including increased e-commerce, retail mobile applications and last-mile delivery services. Consequently, Grupo Éxito intends to accelerate the development of its digital and omni-channel activities in Colombia through efforts to increase the number of users of the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications and expanding the Puntos Colombia loyalty program application that Grupo Éxito has developed in partnership with Bancolombia with rewards that can be used by customers at several companies. - Property development: Grupo Éxito plans to continue expanding its Viva Malls property development business in Colombia, which has become the leading player in the Colombian commercial property market. We are further seeking ways to increase the strategic focus of our Latam Retail operations. GPA recently completed the spin-off of Assaí from the rest of its activities. The goal of this transaction is to unleash the full potential of Assaí, on the one hand, and of the more traditional retail businesses of GPA and Grupo Éxito, on the other hand. This separation is expected to allow them to operate on a standalone basis, to focus on their respective business models and market opportunities. They are also expected to benefit from direct access to the capital markets and other sources of funding and eliminate corporate 20 ----- inefficiencies, creating more value for their respective shareholders.

Footfall and consumer spending in Paris continue to be weaker than in the other geographic markets in which we operate as a result of reduced tourism and the trend toward office workers temporarily moving to other suburban and rural regions or otherwise working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We expect the incremental impact of the new lockdown measures affecting 16 French departments (including Île-deFrance) that were announced on March 18, 2021 on our net sales for the three months ending March 31, 2021 will be limited, as the French government concurrently changed the start of the evening curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., which will allow slightly extended opening hours at our shops. 23 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Non-recurring financial items include changes in the fair value of equity derivatives (such as total return swaps and forward contracts on CBD shares) and the effects of discounting tax liabilities in Brazil. Underlying net profit/(loss), Group share corresponds to underlying net profit/(loss), adjusted for minority interests in underlying profit/(loss). Minority interests in underlying profit/(loss) represent the share of underlying net profit/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.

(2) For a reconciliation of EBITDA to trading profit, see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other _Historical and As Adjusted Financial Information”. Net sales_ Net sales decreased by €2,733 million, or 7.9%, from €34,645 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €31,912 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to adverse foreign exchange developments, in particular with respect to the exchange rate of the Brazilian real against the euro, and hyperinflation in Argentina, as well as the Group’s reduced scope of consolidation as a result of divestitures during the period and the effects of governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lockdowns, store closures and curfews. These developments were partially offset by strong food and e-commerce sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. On an organic basis, consolidated net sales grew 9.0%, and on a same-store basis, net sales grew by 7.8%. France Retail France Retail net sales decreased by €1,103 million, or 6.8%, from €16,322 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €15,219 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, France Retail net sales increased by 0.5%, and on a same-store basis, France Retail net sales grew by 3.0%. Sales performance by format over the period was as follows: - Monoprix net sales decreased by €11 million, or 0.2%, from €4,548 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €4,537 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On a same-store basis, Monoprix net sales grew by 1.6%. Monoprix net sales were negatively impacted by the reduction in consumer expenditure in Paris resulting from the decrease in footfall from tourists and office workers, as well as the impact of the closure of nonessential stores and the curfew implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by the increased growth of its e-commerce and organic food sales. E-commerce sales were driven by the success of the partnership with Amazon Prime Now, which was extended during the year to new cities (including Lyon and Bordeaux), and the ramp-up of Monoprix Plus, which benefits from innovative next-day delivery technology, and has been operational since May 2020. Monoprix also continued to prioritize innovation, with the opening of a new concept store in Montparnasse in September and the launch of a fully autonomous store called “Blackbox”, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. - Supermarket net sales decreased by €73 million, or 2.3%, from €3,142 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €3,069 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an 117 ----- organic basis, Supermarket net sales increased by 3.3%. On a same-store basis, Supermarket net sales grew by 5.4%. The decrease in Supermarket net sales was primarily driven by a decrease in fuel sales due to lower demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by strong food sales with the deployment of nonperishable formats such as the Cave à Bières, as well as Italian and Portuguese products. Organic food sales exhibited a double-digit growth rate for the year. E-commerce activities exhibited a triple-digit growth rate, with the acceleration of drive, click & collect and home delivery services. In 2020, this format signed partnerships with Deliveroo and Uber Eats and launched Casino Plus, in partnership with Ocado. The Supermarket format also pursued the development of autonomous solutions allowing for extended opening hours, with more than two thirds of its stores including such capabilities. The format also deployed rapid check-out solutions, as well as the scan express functionality of the Casino Max application, in order to increase service operationality and decrease customer waiting times. - Franprix net sales increased by €53 million, or 3.5%, from €1,526 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,579 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, Franprix net sales increased by 3.9%. On a same-store basis, Franprix net sales grew by 7.1%. The strong sales dynamics in the suburban environs of Paris were able to more than offset the drop in consumption in central Paris, and the e-commerce delivery and organic food segments also supported same-store growth. Franprix reinforced its ecommerce solutions with click-& collect and home delivery services, in particular with the development of its partnership with Deliveroo. In parallel, Franprix continues to deploy its autonomous stores and to develop its non-food offerings, including through a partnership with Decathlon in 2020 and a partnership with Hema in 2019. - Convenience net sales increased by €99 million, or 7.5%, from €1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,416 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, Convenience net sales grew by 7.6%. On a same-store basis, Convenience net sales grew by 10.3%. The increase in Convenience net sales was primarily due to strong performance in the banner driven by the growing attractiveness of the format given recent consumption trends that favor proximity and convenience. - Géant Hypermarkets net sales decreased by €725 million, or 16.7%, from €4,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €3,620 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, Géant Hypermarkets net sales decreased by 5.7%. On a samestore basis, Géant Hypermarkets net sales decreased by 2.2%. The organic and same-store development of net sales in the Géant Hypermarkets format was negatively impacted by the lockdown measures, closure of non-essential shops and curfews implemented during the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce sales continued to exhibit strong growth, notably due to partnerships entered into with Deliveroo and Uber Eats. In addition, this format accelerated its strategy of implementing the “shopin-shop” concept in 2020, with the entry into new partnerships with C&A, Claire’s and Hema. The digitalization strategy was accelerated, with Casino Max application holders accounting for approximately 22% of Géant Hypermarket net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 (compared with 20% in the fourth quarter of 2019). Finally, the deployment of autonomous solutions that permit the extension of opening hours continued with 44 newly equipped hypermarkets during 2020, as a result of which approximately 70% of Géant Hypermarket locations now employ autonomous technology solutions. 118 ----- - The Data and Data Centers activities of our France Retail segment, which include relevanC and ScaleMax, benefitted from €55 million in cumulative net sales generated by relevanC after its demerger from 3W in the year ended December 31, 2020. On a constant-perimeter basis, relevanC recorded a year-on-year increase of more than 50%. E-commerce E-commerce net sales increased by €71 million, or 3.6%, from €1,966 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2,037 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily driven by an increase in GMV of €308 million, or 8%, from €3,899 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €4,207 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, GMV grew by 8.6% during 2020. Growth in E-commerce GMV was driven primarily by the following factors: - ongoing expansion of the marketplace, which contributed 43.6% of GMV, an increase of 5.3 percentage points over 2019; and - growth in Cdiscount’s international platform, the GMV of which doubled for the year as compared with 2019. Further, Cdiscount consolidated its status as the number two player in France in terms of monthly unique visitors, with an active user base of more than 10 million users and more than 20 million unique monthly visitors during the year, reaching a peak of approximately 26 million visitors in December 2020. Latam Retail Latam Retail net sales decreased by €1,701 million, or 10.4%, from €16,358 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €14,656 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, in particular with respect to the exchange rate of the Brazilian real against the euro, as well as hyperinflation in Argentina. These factors were partially offset by strong organic performance in the Latam Retail segment, as further explained below. On an organic basis, Latam Retail net sales increased by 17.3%, and on a same-store basis, Latam Retail net sales increased by 11.6%. Sales in Brazil rose 21.2% on an organic basis and 12.8% on a same-store basis, excluding fuel and calendar effects. - Multivarejo continued to optimize its store portfolio with the ongoing conversion of Extra Super stores, bringing the total Mercado Extra stores to 147. Pão de Açucar benefited from the growth of its 46 new-generation (G7) stores, an acceleration in e-commerce and newly adapted commercial initiatives in each of its stores. In the convenience format, thirdquarter sales increased by a double-digit percentage for the tenth year in a row. Within Hypermarchés Extra, the process of renovating stores continued, with the aim of increasing their attractiveness through competitive prices, client services and simplification of nonfood product offerings. - Assaí (Cash & Carry) sales were up 29.3% on an organic basis in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, supported by the strong results of the 19 stores opened during the year and store expansions in previous 119 ----- years, as well as by a good same-store performance in the year ended December 31, 2020. Assaí represented 55% of sales in Brazil, a significant portion of the Group’s operations in the country. In addition, GPA continued to pursue its omni-channel strategy. The food E-commerce format reported annual growth of 203%, led by expansion of express delivery and click & collect services. James Delivery, a last-mile delivery operator supporting our formats in Brazil, was operational in 32 cities by the end of the year. Grupo Éxito net sales were up by 6.2% on an organic basis and up by 7.9% on a same-store basis, suppported by the success of the Éxito Wow and Carulla Fresh Market formats. E-commerce formats also showed accelerated growth, with a reported growth in E-commerce net sales in Colombia of 166% as compared to 2019. _Other revenue_ Other revenue decreased by €67 million, or 10.1%, from €665 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €598 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, for the reasons described below. France Retail other revenue decreased by €39 million, or 7.9%, from €494 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €455 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rental revenue. Latam Retail other revenue decreased by €28 million, or 16.5%, from €171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €142 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to currency effects. _Gross margin_ Gross margin decreased by €569 million, or 6.5%, from €8,765 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €8,195 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, for the reasons discussed below. As a percentage of total revenue, gross margin increased from 24.8% in 2019 to 25.2% in 2020. In France Retail, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points, primarily due to a favorable revenue mix effect, with increasing sales generated by premium and proximity banners that generate higher margins in line with the Group’s strategic plan and strongly amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic context, with government restrictions limiting the population’s movements. Our E-commerce segment’s gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 2.9 percentage points, mainly as a result of (i) the growth of the share of GMV generated by the marketplace, which accounted for 44% of total GMV in 2020, (ii) a favorable product mix evolution with increasing sales of high-margin and recurring purchase products (including in the home, leisure and beauty categories) and (iii) the monetization of B2C and B2B services, in particular digital marketing.. In Latam Retail, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 0.2 percentage points, primarily due to the increase of profitability of the Assaí business unit and the recognition of tax credits at Multivarejo. _SG&A_ SG&A decreased by €674 million, or 9.0%, from €7,443 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €6,770 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In France Retail, SG&A decreased by €185 million, or 4.2%, from €4,391 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €4,205 million for the 120 ----- year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the implementation in the second half-year of an operational efficiency and cost savings plan across the Group’s banners. E-commerce SG&A increased by €20 million, or 8.0%, from €256 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €276 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher expenses in the areas of technology and content to support and further boost our B2C and B2B services monetization initiatives. In Latam Retail, SG&A decreased by €476 million, or 15.5%, from €3,067 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €2,591 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to currency effects. At constant exchange rates, SG&A in Latam Retail would have increased by 9.4%. _Trading profit_ Trading profit increased by €104 million, or 7.9%, from €1,321 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €1,426 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the strong performance of the Latam retail segment, partially offset by the adverse impacts from foreign exchange rates. At constant exchange rates, trading profit increased by 25.2%. As a percentage of net sales, trading profit increased from 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020. France Retail Trading profit for our France Retail segment decreased by €65 million, or 9.4%, from €689 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €625 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due primarily to the temporary additional costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic incurred in the first half of 2020 (including €37 million in special bonuses to employees) and GreenYellow’s transition to a company-owned asset model, as well as the loss of the contribution of Vindémia to our trading profit as a result of its disposal in June 2020, which were partially offset by increased profitability in the second half of 2020. As a percentage of France Retail net sales, France Retail trading profit remained largely stable at 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Trading profit for property development activities in our France Retail segment, which are included in total France Retail trading profit, increased from €54 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €63 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 15.2%. E-commerce Trading profit for our E-commerce segment increased by €49 million, from €4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to strong growth in marketplace sales and a shift in the product mix toward higher margin and higher repeat purchase product categories. Latam Retail Trading profit for our Latam Retail segment increased by €120 million, or 19.1%, from €628 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €748 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. On an organic basis, Latam Retail trading profit increased by 55.3%. As a percentage of Latam Retail net sales, Latam Retail trading profit increased from 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Latam Retail trading profit was primarily a result of the recognition of tax credits in an amount of €139 million in Brazil in 2020 (with none in 2019) and strong performance at each of our banners in the segment, with Multivarejo’s performance benefitting from its successful implementation of 121 ----- its marketing strategy and operational efficiency plans, Assaí exhibiting strong business momentum and Grupo Éxito exhibiting a stable constant-currency trading profit despite challenging trading conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions. These impacts were partially offset by negative foreign exchange effects in an amount of €224 million. Excluding tax credits and currency effects, Latam Retail trading profit would have increased by €159 million. _Other operating income and expenses_ Other operating net expenses increased by €84 million, or 11.8%, from a net expense of €713 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a net expense of €797 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to the France Retail and E-commerce segments, where other operating net expenses increased by €64 million, or 10.2%, from €630 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €694 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This included an increase in non-recurring non-cash costs in an amount of €147 million related to an impairment charge with respect to non-current assets (mainly related to the Asset Disposal Plan and to impairment tests on individual stores), partially offset by a decrease in non-recurring cash costs in an amount of €83 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 mainly related to further implementation of the Rocade plan. _Net finance costs_ Net finance costs remained largely stable at a net expense of €357 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net expense of €356 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on borrowings, which was almost fully offset by a decrease in interest income on cash and cash equivalents. _Other financial income and expenses_ Other financial net expenses decreased by €58 million, or 12.9%, from a net expense of €450 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to a net expense of €392 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was due primarily to the positive effect of the tax credit recognized in 2020 in respect of PIS and COFINS taxes in Brazil, which were previously subject to litigation, following a final and unappealable court decision in favor of GPA. _Profit (loss) before tax_ Loss before tax decreased from €198 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €120 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the factors discussed above. _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense decreased by €50 million from €132 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €82 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the effects of the restructuring of GPA’s Brazilian operations and the Franprix-Leader Price sub-group, partially offset by an increase in the effective corporate tax rate resulting mainly from a revaluation of deferred tax assets based on expected future tax rates applicable to the Group and the revaluation of our subsidiary Immobilière Groupe Casino. _Share of profit of equity-accounted investees_ Share of profit of equity-accounted investees increased to €50 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from €46 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due 122 ----- to the performance of equity-accounted investees in the Latam Retail segment, whose contribution increased by €3 million between the two periods. _Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations_ Net loss from continuing operations decreased from €283 million for the year ended December 31, [2019 to €152 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, for the reasons described above. Net loss from](http://above.net/) continuing operations, attributable to the owners of the parent, decreased from €396 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to €370 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

This increase was primarily due to an increase in Latam Retail net sales and stable E-commerce net sales, which were partially offset by a decrease in France Retail net sales. On an organic basis, consolidated net sales grew by 4.2%, and on a same-store basis, net sales grew by 2.2%. France Retail France Retail net sales decreased by €465 million, or 2.8%, from €16,786 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €16,322 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

On an organic basis, Monoprix net sales grew by 0.4%. On a same-store basis, Monoprix net sales grew by 0.2%. The E-commerce channel was particularly strong, supported by the success of the partnership with Amazon Prime Now, which was extended during the year to cover new towns and cities as well as Naturalia products. The banner accelerated the deployment of its autonomous stores which allow extended opening hours. The Naturalia format dedicated to organic products saw further growth. - Supermarket net sales decreased by €83 million, or 2.6%, from €3,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €3,142 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Franprix earned 50 awards in 2019, both for its ongoing innovation across the board (concepts, products, HR initiatives) and for its partnerships. - Convenience net sales grew by €4 million, or 0.3%, from €1,313 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On an organic basis, Convenience net sales grew by 1%. On a same-store basis, Convenience net sales grew by 1.6%.

The format enhanced its private label, with 124 ----- sales of organic products posting significant growth over the year, while developing its autonomous stores. - Géant Hypermarkets net sales decreased by €191 million, or 4.2%, from €4,537 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €4,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On an organic basis, Géant Hypermarkets net sales grew by 1.1%. On a same-store basis, Géant Hypermarket net sales grew by 0.7%. Géant Hypermarkets saw a positive annual trend led by organic products, e-commerce, the roll-out of “shops-in-shops”, and digital initiatives such as Casino Max. In addition, the banner continued to deploy autonomous stores. - The Data and Data Centers division of our France Retail segment, which includes relevanC (previously 3W.relevanC) and ScaleMax, generated €61 million in cumulative net sales, up 51% from 2018, due to an expansion in activities. During 2019, 3W.relevanC and Maxit were merged under the relevanC brand, and new products were launched, including the TV2Store in partnership with Orange and the Smart Couponing platform. In addition, Scalemax opened its first computing center in Île-de-France and signed its first major contract with BNP Paribas. E-commerce E-commerce net sales were stable, increasing by €1 million from €1,965 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,966 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily driven by an increase in GMV of €253 million, or 7%, from €3,646 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €3,899 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On an organic basis, GMV grew by 9.1% during 2019. Growth in E-commerce GMV was driven primarily by the following factors: - ongoing expansion of the marketplace, which contributed 38.1% of GMV, an increase of 3.7 percentage points over 2018; and - growth in Cdiscount’s B2C services, which contributed 3.4 percentage points to GMV growth during 2019. The contribution of mobile solutions to GMV was 5.5 percentage points higher during 2019, at 49.5%. Further, Cdiscount consolidated its status as the number two e-commerce player in France in terms of monthly unique visitors. Latam Retail Latam Retail net sales increased by €780 million, or 5.0%, from €15,577 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €16,358 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as explained below.

Sales by GPA Food in Brazil rose 11.0% on an organic basis and 3.2% on a same-store basis, excluding fuel and calendar effects. 125 ----- - Multivarejo continued to optimize its store portfolio. 92 Extra Super stores, or 70% of the portfolio, were converted in the year, bringing the total to 100 Mercado Extra stores and 28 Compre Bem stores. 20 Pão de Açucar stores were renovated during the year ended December 31, 2019, bringing the total number of new-generation stores to 46, representing 40% of the banner’s sales. In the convenience format, 10 new Minuto Pao de Açucar stores were opened. A new segmentation of the Hypermarchés Extra store portfolio was established, separating out high-performing stores from stores to be optimized in the portfolio. These underperforming stores may be ultimately converted to the Assaí format or may be sold. - Assaí (Cash & Carry) sales were up 21.5% on an organic basis, supported by the excellent results of the 22 stores opened in the year ended December 31, 2019 and store expansions in previous years, as well as by a good same-store performance. Retail space increased by 20%. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Assaí represented over 51% of GPA’s sales in Brazil, underlining the pertinence of its business model. From 2014 to 2019, the Company’s net sales had tripled, leading to a market share of 28.5% in 2019, a rise of 7.5 percentage points when compared with 2018. In addition, GPA continued to pursue its omni-channel strategy. The food E-commerce format reported annual growth of 40%, led by expansion of express delivery and click & collect services. Grupo Éxito net sales were up by 6.2% on an organic basis and by 6.0% on a same-store basis, supported by the success of the Éxito Wow, Carulla Fresh Market and Surtimayorista formats. _Other revenue_ Other revenue increased by €132 million, or 24.8%, from €533 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €665 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons described below. France Retail other revenue increased by €112 million, or 29.3%, from €382 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €494 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in property development sales and in property trading activity in France (which is by its nature subject to volatility due to the number of ongoing projects at any given point in time) and an increase in GreenYellow revenue. Latam Retail other revenue increased by €20 million, or 13.2%, from €151 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €171 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to an increase in rental and property development revenue. _Gross margin_ Gross margin decreased by €199 million, or 2.2%, from €8,963 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €8,764 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the reasons discussed below. As a percentage of total revenue, gross margin slightly decreased from 25.7% in 2018 to 24.8% in 2019. In France Retail, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue remained largely stable, increasing by 0.1 percentage points. Our E-commerce segment’s gross margin as a percentage of total revenue increased by 2.9 percentage points. Gross margin benefited from the increased share of marketplace sales in Cdiscount’s GMV and associated commissions, continued growth in monetization revenues and improvements in core business profitability. 126 ----- In Latam Retail, gross margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 2.1 percentage points, due to the one-off effect of tax credits during the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as higher relative proportion of sales from Assaí, which operates with a lower margin. _SG&A_ SG&A decreased by €128 million, or 1.7%, from €7,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €7,471 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In France Retail, SG&A decreased by €143 million, or 3.1%, from €4,548 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €4,405 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the impacts of changes in consolidation scope following disposals made pursuant to the Rocade Plan. E-commerce SG&A increased by €40 million, or 18.6%, from €216 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €256 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In Latam Retail, at actual exchange rates, SG&A decreased by €10 million, or 0.3%, and at constant exchange rates, it would have increased by €133 million, or 4.3%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in SG&A in line with growth in sales at Assaí. _Trading profit_ As a result of the foregoing, trading profit decreased by €72 million, or 5.3%, from €1,364 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,292 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the trading profit of our Latam Retail segment, which was only partially offset by increases in the other segments’ trading profit, for the reasons set forth below. At constant exchange rates, trading profit decreased by 3.1%. Excluding the impact of tax credits in Brazil of €111 million in 2018 (there was no impact in 2019), trading profit increased by 3.2% on an as-reported basis and 5.5% on an organic basis. As a percentage of net sales, trading profit decreased from 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. France Retail Trading profit for our France Retail segment increased by €58 million, or 9.4%, from €618 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €676 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to improved retail trading profit and the development of additional businesses (including GreenYellow and relevanC). As a percentage of France Retail net sales, France Retail trading profit increased from 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Trading profit for the retail business excluding property development trading increased from €557 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €622 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 11.6%. E-commerce Trading profit for our E-commerce segment increased by €16 million from a loss of €12 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a profit of €4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to strong growth in the marketplace and a solid expansion of monetization revenues, along with continued improvements of core business profitability. Latam Retail Trading profit for our Latam Retail segment decreased by €146 million, or 19.3%, from €758 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €612 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On an organic basis, Latam Retail profit decreased by 14.2%. As a percentage of Latam Retail net sales, Latam 127 ----- Retail trading profit decreased from 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in Latam Retail trading profit was primarily impacted by the recognition of tax credits in Brazil in 2018 (with none in 2019), and negative currency impact of nearly 4%. Excluding tax credits and currency effects, Latam Retail trading profit remained stable at €642 million. At GPA, Multivarejo’s trading margin was impacted by investments in promotional campaigns, while Assaí’s trading margin excluding tax credits increased by approximately 0.2%. At Grupo Éxito, trading margin improved by approximately 0.2%, led by the success of new concepts and E-commerce. _Other operating income and expenses_ Other operating net expenses increased by €317 million, or 78.9%, from a net expense of €402 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net expense of €719 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the France Retail segment, as other operating income and expenses decreased for the Latam Retail segment. In the France Retail segment, other operating income and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a net expense of €619 million. This included an increase in non-recurring costs, which was mainly non-cash (€200 million) and was related to the Asset Disposal Plan. Cash expenses under the Rocade Plan (€95 million) were funded by disposals of our loss-making stores. Excluding the Rocade Plan, restructuring costs fell sharply (down 51% compared to 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2018, other operating income and expenses included a net expense of €292 million in France Retail, which was mainly due to restructuring costs incurred to complete major store transformation plans. _Net finance costs_ Net finance costs increased by €37 million, or 11.5%, from a net expense of €320 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net expense of €356 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase resulted from an increase in interest expense on borrowings, as well as a slight decrease in interest income on cash and cash equivalents. _Other financial income and expenses_ Other financial income and expenses increased by €37 million, or 10.5%, from a net expense of €356 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net expense of €394 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was due primarily to the net effect of remeasurements at fair value of nonhedging derivative instruments (including the GPA TRS). _Profit before tax_ Profit before tax decreased from a net profit of €286 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net loss of €176 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the factors discussed above. _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense decreased by €51 million from €188 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €137 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Income tax expense was primarily driven by the decrease in profit before tax and was also impacted by (i) the tax-exempt competitiveness and employment tax credit (“CICE”) to which French companies were entitled until 2018, which was replaced 128 ----- as from January 1, 2019 with a reduction in an employer’s payroll-based contribution that increased our tax base, as well as (ii) a lower level of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits on tax losses and other deductible temporary differences in 2019 compared to 2018. _Share of profit of equity-accounted investees_ Share of profit of equity-accounted investees decreased to €46 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to the performance of equity-accounted investees in the Latam Retail segment, whose contribution declined by €12 million between the two periods. _Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations_ Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations decreased from a net profit of €159 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net loss of €268 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the [reasons described above. Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to the owners of the](http://above.net/) parent, decreased from a net loss of €60 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a net loss of €384 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in non-recurring non-cash costs relating to the Asset Disposal Plan.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The held-for-sale criteria in IFRS 5 apply to non-current assets (or disposal groups) whose value will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. The criteria do not apply to non-current assets that are being scrapped, wound down or abandoned. As of December 31, 2020, we had €703 million in net assets classified under IFRS 5 on our balance sheet in our France Retail segment. These were primarily related to the Asset Disposal Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net assets on our balance sheet classified under IFRS 5, in the France Retail segment, decreased by €863 million, due primarily to the completion of the sale of Vindémia, the unwinding of the Mercialys TRS and the completion of the Leader Price Disposal during the year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

As of December 31, 2020, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, our France Retail and Ecommerce adjusted gross debt would have amounted to €4,761 million and our France Retail and Ecommerce adjusted net debt would have amounted to €3,951 million. On a combined basis and including the Segisor Credit Facility, France Retail and E-commerce adjusted gross debt decreased from €6,100 million as of December 31, 2019 to €4,761 million as of December 31, 2020. This was mostly due to asset disposals during 2020, including the disposal of Leader Price stores, and the repayment of certain of our borrowings out of the proceeds thereof.

This mainly reflects lower proceeds from asset disposals during 2019 compared with 2018, a cash outflow of €109 million due to the unwinding of the forward contract on GPA shares and a payment of €193 million relating to the refinancing transactions into an escrow account. Net cash from/(used in) financing activities Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations increased to a net outflow of €1,792 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from a net outflow of €1,396 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This mainly reflects the effect on cash and cash equivalents of transactions with non-controlling interests primarily related to GreenYellow in 2018 and the Latam Reorganization Transactions in 2019. These impacts were partially offset by the decrease of dividends paid and the cash inflow from new borrowings. 131 ----- _in millions of euros_",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

This change is primarily due to reduced dividend income and an increase in other financial expenses, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA (aside from the non-cash impact of deneutralized EBITDA related to property development operations with Mercialys). Gross capital expenditures increased in 2020 to €505 million, compared with the €437 million in 2019, primarily as a result of the acceleration of store digitalization projects and investments in GreenYellow, and working capital variation improved by €127 million.

This change is primarily due to a reduction of €205 million in gross capital expenditures and a €214 million improvement in working capital variation. Gross capital expenditures decreased in 2019 compared with prior years (€639 million in 2017 and €559 million in 2018) primarily because of the end of major transformation programs at the Franprix, Casino Supermarkets and Géant Casino banners. The improvement in working capital was mainly driven by action plans to reduce inventories, which included a reduction in slow-moving SKUs, the creation of local inventory storage capabilities and the optimization of our logistics organization.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our liquidity policy is to ensure that we have sufficient liquid assets to settle our liabilities as they fall due, in either normal or impaired market conditions. We aim to mitigate liquidity risk through: - diversifying financing sources; - diversifying borrowing currencies; - maintaining at all times confirmed financing facilities that significantly exceed our liabilities; - limiting annual debt repayments and proactively managing the repayment schedule; and - managing the average maturity of debt. The liquidity analysis is performed both for our France Retail & E-commerce segment (taking into account the cash pool in place with most French subsidiaries) and for each of our international subsidiaries.

We are exposed to this risk to the extent that our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates. Our objective is to manage our exposure to the risk of interest rate changes and optimize our financing costs. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk consists of dynamic debt management by monitoring and, where necessary, adjusting our hedging ratio based on forecast trends in interest rates. We use various standard instruments to implement this strategy, principally interest rate swaps and options 140 ----- (including caps, floors and swaptions). These instruments do not always qualify for hedge accounting; however, all interest rate instruments are contracted in line with our risk management policy. The Issuer’s debt is mainly composed of fixed-rate bonds and the Existing Term Loan B Facility and, following completion of the Transactions, the Issuer’s debt will mainly be composed of fixed rate bonds and the New Term Loan B Facility. Certain interest streams on part of the Issuer’s fixed-rate debt were swapped for variable rate streams. As of December 31, 2020, the Issuer had a portfolio of 44 interest rate swaps and options with approximately 10 bank counterparties. These instruments expire at various dates between 2021 and 2026. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, 29% of the outstanding amount of the Issuer’s bond debt was hedged at a fixed rate, 26% was hedged at capped or floored variable rates and 45% was unhedged and accrued at uncapped variable rates.

Currency translation risk primarily concerns the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries in Brazil and Colombia and arises from changes in exchange rates for the Brazilian real and Colombian peso against the euro. Transaction risk mainly concerns goods purchases billed in U.S. dollars. An unfavorable change in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements (translation risk) and lead to financial losses (transaction risk). We hedge currency transaction risk on highly probable future purchases (mainly goods purchases billed in U.S. dollars) through forward purchases of the payment currency. In addition, we fully hedge currency risks on debt issuances denominated in a currency other than that of the issuer. We use standard financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward currency transactions to manage our exposure to currency risks. These instruments are mainly over-the-counter instruments entered into with first-class bank counterparties. Most of these transactions or instruments qualify for hedge accounting. However, like many other large groups, we may take very small, strictly controlled positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting, for more dynamic and flexible management of our interest rate exposures.

If a counterparty risk were to occur, we could incur financial losses. We monitor these risks regularly using several objective indicators and attempt to reduce our exposure by dealing with low-risk counterparties (as determined mainly on such counterparties’ credit ratings and their reciprocal commitments with us).

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"We operate in a highly competitive industry and rapidly evolving markets, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures.","Our competition generally includes international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers (generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, specialists and convenience stores) and their ecommerce sites. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, product variety, brand reputation, store condition and stage of multi-channel development. In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others: - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our markets, or consolidation of existing operators; - potential creation by competitors of new store formats or further development of ecommerce platforms that customers may prefer; - the risk of our competitors adopting our business model in their own stores; and - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as discount retailers. The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing and promotions, product mix or other business strategies, and our response to address competition, may cause us to experience lower sales revenue, higher operating expenses and/or lower profit margins. Moreover, to a more limited extent, our own similarly-positioned brands and banners may compete with one another for customers. The expansion of online sales channels, both by existing market participants and new entrants, has further intensified the competitive dynamics of our industry and we expect this trend to continue, particularly as a result of consumers’ increased reliance on e-commerce retailers since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition, in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce, is particularly intense in the 41 ----- mature French market. In our international operations, we are a leader in most of the markets in which we operate. Our competitors in these markets include international and local retailers, including cash & carry operators and hard discount retailers, seeking to strengthen their positions. We monitor the competitive environment of our markets and their trends at a country and banner level in the short term through efficient pricing management and carrying out promotional or loyalty campaigns. In the medium term, we also monitor our mix of formats and banners and seek out opportunities to increase multi-channel sales. We also seek to identify and execute asset development, franchise transactions or purchase and sale transactions by strategically identifying and developing store formats and banners tailored to the different locations in which they operate. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in preventing our competitors from making significant inroads in our markets at our expense. Our pure e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, and our brick-and-mortar banners, most of which have e-commerce operations, also face intense competition from both other e-commerce providers and brickand-mortar retailers with e-commerce operations. Online retailers such as Amazon may have more experience and greater resources than we do and may be able to offer products at more attractive prices than we can. Retailers are increasingly introducing and continually enhancing the capabilities of their internet distribution platforms. Barriers to entry for e-commerce are low, and current and new competitors can launch new e-commerce platforms at a relatively low cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful e-commerce companies. In addition, a significant amount of Cdiscount’s business relies on its ability to attract both customers and sellers to use its marketplace. We expect competition on online channels to continue to intensify and as a result, we may experience pricing pressure and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with our competitors or that new competitors will not enter the industry. Even in geographies in which we have a particularly strong retail presence, such as the Paris region, we face the risk that new retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing pressure. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.2,We are exposed to economic and other trends that could adversely impact our operations.,"Demand for our products and services could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending. The sales, operating performance and cash generation of our businesses are strongly correlated with non-discretionary household expenditure. A global economic downturn that impacts any of the countries in which we do business may adversely affect consumer confidence and demand for nonessential goods such as those sold by Monoprix, Cdiscount and our Latam Retail banners. A global economic downturn may also have an adverse impact on the sale of food and other non-discretionary items as consumers may reduce the overall amount they spend, by purchasing more entrylevel products and/or shopping at stores operating under lower-cost formats, such as cash & carry or hard discount stores. Even when consumers switch to our banners operating under such formats, entry-level products and banners with a low-price positioning tend to be structurally less profitable. As a result, our profitability may be adversely impacted if the mix of formats generating our sales changes significantly as a result of economic conditions. Moreover, our businesses are concentrated in France and a limited number of countries in Latin America, increasing our exposure to unfavorable macroeconomic developments affecting those countries. For example, approximately 70% of our stores were located in France as of December 31, 2020 and consequently, any deterioration in the French or European economy could have a significant effect on our 42 ----- overall business, results of operations and financial condition. According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques, or INSEE), French GDP declined by 8.3% in 2020, and only grew by 1.5% in 2019 and 1.8%, in 2018. The macro-financial outlook in our markets has recently been strongly influenced by external factors such as the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various lockdowns that occurred in the spring and autumn of 2020, as well as governmental restrictions on activity that have continued into 2021. More generally, external factors such as the weaker and maturing global economic cycle, the greater uncertainty associated with global trade tensions and the risks that such tensions pose on economic growth and global stability have also influenced the macro-economic outlook. According to the IMF, GDP contracted in the markets in which we operate for the year ended December 31, 2020 (by 9.0% in France, 4.5% in Brazil, 8.2% in Colombia and 4.5% in Uruguay). The strength of our business is tied with the GDP growth in the various countries in which we operate and, as such, lower GDP in the various countries in which we operate could adversely affect our operations, sales revenue and financial results. In addition, economic activity and financial stability in Europe could be affected by the monetary policy normalization that the European Central Bank is expected to continue implementing. Economic activity remains dependent on highly accommodative macroeconomic policies and is subject to downside risks. The implementation of policies that are perceived to be less consumer-friendly may restrict economic recovery. In addition, political developments in the European Union (the “EU”), including future integration or withdrawal of European countries in the EU, such as Brexit, or changes in the economic policy, executive authority or composition of the EU and its institutions, may have an adverse effect on the overall economic stability of the EU and the European countries in which our assets and operations are located. Furthermore, potential EU instability may have important consequences on our ability to obtain supplies from other EU countries at reasonable costs. Political, economic, regulatory or administrative developments in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Latin American economies have also historically been subject to swings in economic activity, including for example, Brazil, where the economy experienced an economic downturn in 2015 and 2016 and fell into recession towards the end of 2020, and in Argentina, which the Group has qualified as a hyperinflationary economy. Our net sales and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which in turn is influenced by the cyclical nature of the global economy, the outbreak of global pandemics or health crises (and related governmental restrictions on consumer activity), levels of unemployment, population demographics, inflation or deflation, real disposable income, VAT increases, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, social movements and consumer perception of overall economic conditions and their own economic prospects, all of which are factors beyond our control. For example, these factors may make it more difficult to increase prices or may result in decreased footfall in our stores. To limit our sensitivity to economic and other trends, we have focused on diversification of our business operations across several geographies and across new business activities to reduce our dependence on the food business cycle, such as energy offerings through GreenYellow and data solutions through relevanC and ScaleMax. In addition, we have developed omni-channel distribution across a broad spectrum of both digital and brickand-mortar formats and concentrated on consistently adapting our banners and brand concepts to meet the needs of our target customer base, such as by increasing the number of stores specializing in organic products. However, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful in limiting the impact of unfavorable economic conditions or other trends, which are not in our control. Unfavorable economic conditions or uncertain economic or political outlooks in one or more of the principal markets in which we operate or will operate in the future could therefore significantly and adversely affect our net sales, growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to implement our strategic decisions. 43 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and this or other future pandemics could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.","The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on our operations, including by, among other things, requiring us to manage customer numbers at our premises, reduce the operation of certain stores depending on the guidelines or orders of the relevant government, invest in protective and other safety equipment, accelerate the deployment of automated check-outs, increase our capacity for home delivery and click & collect purchase options, build up our inventory of consumer staples and undertake a transition to a remote work environment for our corporate offices in response to new regulatory requirements. We also paid special employee bonuses for a total expense of €37 million in France in the first half of 2020. Many of the shelter-in-place requirements imposed by the governments in the countries where we operate were reinstated in the fall of 2020 and winter of 2021, following the easing of the onerous lockdown restrictions imposed at the outset of the pandemic over the course of the summer of 2020, as a result of high levels of new cases continuing to be registered in many countries and the emergence of new variant strains of the virus. According to the IMF, GDP contracted in the markets in which we operate for the year ended December 31, 2020 (by 9.0% in France, 4.5% in Brazil, 8.2% in Colombia and 4.5% in Uruguay). While the IMF currently forecasts a renewed expansion in these markets for 2021, such expansion is not expected to fully compensate the GDP contraction in 2020, and a prolonged recessionary environment could materially and adversely affect consumer spending, wholesale client purchasing power and commercial property prices, which could negatively affect our business. In the first quarter of 2021, several countries, including France and Brazil, have witnessed new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a renewed tightening of governmental restrictions on activity. Although vaccine campaigns are underway throughout the world, there can be no assurance that these will substantially curb the pandemic in the short to medium term, particularly given issues with supply and distribution of the vaccine and the emergence of variant strains. In the event of a worsening or resurgence of COVID-19 in any of the markets in which we operate, or the occurrence of another widespread regional, national or global health epidemic or pandemic, our business could be severely adversely impacted. The long-term financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such factors as consumer consumption, gross domestic product and exchange rates is unknown at this time. The ongoing prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak could continue to (i) reduce the purchasing power of our customers, (ii) reduce tourism numbers, which generally contribute to our sales revenue in the summer months at certain of our store locations, (iii) adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying the production and delivery of products to our stores, (iv) adversely impact transport availability and cost, (v) impact the financial stability of our suppliers and franchisees and (vi) impact the valuation of our real estate holdings. While we have seen a significant increase in the volume of home delivery, click & collect and drive & collect purchases, and have adapted our distribution networks to accommodate this surge in demand, we are unable to predict whether COVID-19 (including any future waves of this disease) will have any long-term impact on consumer shopping behavior and how this may impact our business strategies and outlook moving forward. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to scale our online delivery and curb-side pick-up options quickly enough, or as quickly as our competitors, to accommodate customers’ demands. Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak, its possible aggravation or any future pandemic, or the perception that such outbreaks may occur, may cause people to avoid gathering in public places, which may adversely affect our customer traffic, our ability to adequately staff our stores and operations and our ability to transport product on a timely basis. Furthermore, to the extent that future disease outbreaks involve a pathogen that is food-borne, or that is perceived to be food-borne, such outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our customers to eat less of such products. 44 ----- A renewed COVID-19 outbreak or any other future pandemic may also result in disruptions to our supply chain, increased diversion of management’s attention, inability to profitably operate our smaller convenience formats due to limitations on the total number of customers that may be in the store at any one time and the inability of our commercial tenants to pay rent. Any of the foregoing impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak or any other future pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our sales, profits, working capital requirements and cash flows within any given year have historically been affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, sales volumes have historically been significantly higher in December in the run-up to the holiday season. In addition, the net sales that we generate from the sale of non-essential goods, especially through our Cdiscount business, is subject to promotional peaks, such as Black Friday, or the biannual sales seasons in France. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory or store closings during these peak periods can affect our working capital requirements. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of other factors, including the timing of new store openings, temporary or definitive closings or disposals, and the net sales contributed by new stores or the loss of net sales from closed or sold stores. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.5,Sales of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences.,"The success of our business depends on the continued appeal of the range of products we offer through our network of stores, franchises and online operations. Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences which can differ in each of the countries in which we operate and across each of our different formats. In addition, demand for our food products could be affected by consumers’ increasing concern regarding food safety, health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy, such as consumers’ increasing focus on the health effects of certain ingredients such as processed fats, gluten, sugar, processed wheat or other such products. Customers have also shown increasing preference for organic products, vegan and animal free protein products, environmentally-friendly product packaging and locally-sourced food products. Further, our customers increasingly expect a seamless multi-channel experience and when making a decision to purchase products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever before, including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Customers also expect to be able to interact in a variety of ways, such as through mobile app purchases. Responding to shifts in consumer preferences can entail significant costs. Moreover, although we have established internal marketing and innovation departments dedicated to monitoring and researching consumer preferences, we may not be successful in accurately predicting shifts in customer preferences or 45 ----- demand for certain products that we offer. Furthermore, although we offer a range of different products across our various banners, failure to accurately identify or quickly and effectively respond to changing customer preferences, demand or prevailing health or dietary preferences could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and our market share as customers may avoid our product offerings in favor of alternative options. Further, if we misjudge demand for certain products, particularly for our non-food products, we may build up excess inventory for those products, which could result in a decrease in their sales prices and inefficient working capital management which, if material, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.6,Our international operations are exposed to political and other business risks.,"Our international operations expose us to risks and uncertainties arising from trading in countries that may experience or have recently experienced periods of economic or political instability, especially in Latin America. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Latin American business of GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito accounted for 46% of our consolidated net sales. The economies of our international markets may be more susceptible to government intervention. For example, the Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and occasionally material, intervention by the Brazilian federal government, which has often modified monetary, credit and other policies intended to influence its economy. More generally, Latin American countries have also historically carried out nationalizations of businesses they deem to be of economic importance, through expropriation, confiscation, requisition or other similar actions. Any such intervention in any of the Latin American countries in which GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito operate may have a direct impact on their operations and/or more generally result in economic uncertainty and heightened volatility. Moreover, certain regulations or governmental actions may create inflationary pressures on the economy, which may lead to tight monetary policies and diminished consumer purchasing power that could materially and adversely affect our operations. For example, Argentina, in which Grupo Éxito conducts a part of its operations, has recently experienced very high inflation rates. We have applied IAS 29, the IFRS standard applicable to hyperinflationary economies, to address this in preparing our consolidated financial statements. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—IAS 29—Financial Reporting in Hyper-Inflationary _Economies”. Furthermore, periods of political uncertainty, such as during presidential elections, may_ further reduce purchases and consumption. Recent impacts of COVID-19 on the economy of the Latin American countries in which we operate have further heightened certain of the inherent risks in operating in these countries. The Latin American operations of GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito involve a number of business risks in the ordinary course of business, such as: - they may experience disputes with lessors of our real property lease holdings as a result of difficulties in establishing title over land; - a substantial portion of the population has reduced purchasing power because it does not use banks or banking institutions in any capacity or has limited access to credit and therefore relies on cash payments, which in turn may delay our growth in the region; and - e-commerce transactions may be impeded by a lack of secure payment methods. The occurrence of these risks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 46 ----- Despite the fact that most of our food products are locally sourced, we face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets, including: - imposition of taxes; - currency and exchange rate risks and exchange controls; - risks related to labor practices and disputes; - risks related to increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods, including product safety or manufacturing safety standards, environmental matters or natural disasters; and - as part of our international strategy, we enter into partnerships in markets in which we are not present, either through licensing our banners to affiliates in international markets or through private-label supply agreements. Any actions of these affiliates or parties to the product supply agreements could harm our brands or reputation. The occurrence of such risks and other risks inherent in operating in and sourcing from emerging foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Other developments, such as local strikes, demonstrations, boycotts, social and economic instability, civil disturbances or similar events, could also have an adverse effect on our retailers’ operations. The occurrence of any of these events may impact customer morale or have a detrimental impact on tourism, which may in turn adversely affect the sales of our retail stores, many of which are concentrated in tourist destinations. The occurrence of any such event may also generally discourage sales of food and other key consumer staples at our retail locations or through our e-commerce channels and have an adverse effect on our operations. For example, in 2018 and 2019, our retail operations and sales were adversely affected by the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protestor movement in France. The sustained civilian protests reduced footfall to a number of our retail locations in France that were near areas of protest. In addition, certain of our larger supermarkets and supply warehouses were disrupted during normal hours of operation due to the high concentration of protesters nearby, which restricted access to our properties. This event also negatively affected our working capital, with a significant inventory build-up and resulting cash requirement. Although we were able to ultimately adjust our supply chain, in the future, such events could prevent us and our franchisees from operating our retail locations at peak capacity or cause disruptions to our suppliers. Any continued or resurgent social and political uncertainty may expose us to greater risks of interruption of our operations. Our security costs may rise and footfall in our stores may suffer as a result of any adjacent incidents of social unrest or violence. In addition, our online operations may suffer if the third-party distributors and shippers or last-mile delivery operators on which we rely are impeded by protests. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. For a discussion of political risks affecting our international operations in developing countries, see “—Our 47 ----- _international operations are exposed to political and other business risks”. More recently, nationwide_ lockdowns related to the rise of COVID-19 cases led to the partial shutdown of certain of our retail spaces and warehouses, government-imposed curfews, increased staff absences and challenges in procuring an uninterrupted flow of essential supplies, as well as a drop in footfall from tourists and office workers in urban locations. Further, recent social and political events have led to boycotts of certain grocery retailers and of French companies. While our Group and its operations have not been directly involved in the activities that have led to such boycotts, any future boycotts that involve our stores or online shops could have an adverse effect on our operations. While we have implemented procedures across all of our businesses to rapidly and efficiently deploy contingency plans in the event of business disruptions, prolonged disruptions of our operations due to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, partial or full store closures due to government-imposed lockdowns or other catastrophic events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance policies in place, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events and any losses that could result from such events in the future, or that such insurance policies would cover all losses related to such events. Further, there may be certain types of losses with respect to which we may not be able to obtain insurance at all, for example it may not be possible to obtain insurance against losses from pandemic-related business interruptions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our operations are subject to physical risks across all countries of operation, which include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as rapid changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. For example, in recent periods France has experienced extreme weather events, such as the increased rainfall that resulted in the Seine River reaching 100-year high levels. Brazil has also recently experienced a mix of drought and torrential rains, while Colombia has seen floods, storms and landslides. Natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemics, drought, changes in rainfall patterns or extreme weather, including floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could interfere with the continuity of our operations due to potential impairments in the food supply chain, power outages, fuel shortages, damage to our production and processing plants, disruption of transportation channels, inflated insurance premiums or increases in the price of raw materials, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, either individually or in the aggregate. In addition, we are subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases including with respect to our supply chain, and compliance with related rules could be difficult and costly. We could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with existing or new greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations. Failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could result in penalties as well as adverse consequences to our reputation and image among our customers and stakeholders.

As a result, any deterioration of our relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Most of our employees in France are covered by national and company-wide collective bargaining agreements which contain provisions that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employee contracts. In addition, all of GPA’s and Assaí’s employees and a portion of Grupo Éxito’s employees are also covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business. In general, French labor law restricts companies’ ability to restructure their operations, irrespective of whether their employees are unionized. As is the case with most companies of our size, we have ongoing disputes with certain of our former employees and may face related litigation in the future.

We also rely on third-party service providers to process customer payments made using bank cards and credit cards. Our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the sub-national, national and international levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result, information about our customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, damage to our reputation, litigation or government enforcement actions, substantial costs and a loss of consumer confidence, all of which may significantly adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and similar regulations, we also face the risk that customer data that we collect, including in connection with our relevanC data analytics and digital advertising businesses, our ScaleMax data center business in France and our Floa Bank consumer finance joint venture in France, as well as for marketing purposes for any of our other businesses, may be stolen or misappropriated. For example, on January 29, 2021, Cnova’s cybersecurity services detected an internal and isolated malicious act consisting of a data theft. Following such detection, Cnova undertook an internal investigation to identify the source, and concluded the perpetrator was a Cnova manager who had been granted legitimate authorizations to access our information system. The data concerned by this malicious act were the name, first name, gender, 49 ----- personal address, email, telephone and the total of the orders of the last two years. Approximately 32 million customers’ data were affected; however, neither bank details (as they were not stored or processed by Cnova) nor user passwords were compromised. Our internal investigation lead to the commencement of a judicial prosecution against the individual involved, who has been indicted in connection with the incident. We also notified the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (the “CNIL”) in accordance with our regulatory obligation of notification. There can be no assurance that this cyber data theft will not result in any liability or reputational harm to Cnova’s business. In addition, we commenced an IT security audit with the assistance of an external consultant and have taken steps to bolster our security procedures for similar risks. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent similar incidents in the future. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and our business model could be negatively affected as a result.

Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with our various brands is central to the success of our business. This can be an especially difficult task for retailers, particularly in light of the development of social media in recent years, which has led to a sharp increase in image and reputational risks. We could be adversely affected if customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell or provide in our retail business, if any negatively publicized events were to occur in one of our retail locations or if we are subject to malicious attacks designed to harm the image of any of our brands.

Although we dedicate substantial resources to the safety and quality of our products, we may not be able to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality products or guarantee product traceability. Our sale of food products for human consumption exposes us to safety risks such as food-borne illnesses, product contamination, spoilage, inaccurate labeling, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination (including the presence of a foreign object, substance, chemical or other agent or residue or, in certain jurisdictions, the introduction of a genetically modified organism), spoilage, misbranding or product tampering could require product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could result in negative publicity, temporary warehouse closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Our reliance on third-party suppliers increases the risk that these incidents could be caused by factors 51 ----- outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected. These risks may also occur under any one of our private labels under our different banners. We may be impacted by negative publicity regarding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or death stemming from product contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. We rely upon electrical power to operate our logistics distribution centers, distribution fleets and storage facilities. To attain maximum performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the appropriate pre-set temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, any extended power supply shortages or interruptions could result in perishable food losses which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients and products are stored and transported, are established both by statute and by us to help guarantee the safety of our food products. Our cold chain is maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen by, our suppliers, through our products’ transportation phase and ultimately to the time of sale in our stores or through online sales or home deliveries. A failure in the cold chain could lead to food contamination, risks to the health of our customers, fines and damage to our brands and reputation, each of which could subsequently affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of non-food products, including, for example, the risks of battery explosions or choking hazards in children’s toys. If products we purchase from our suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds on our purchase price or obtain indemnification from them. The limited capacities of some of our suppliers may result in their inability to replace defective merchandise in a timely manner. The reputation of our brands could be damaged by the marketing of our products, especially in case of serious defects, such as dangerous products or products containing harmful substances, causing physical harm or other health problems. In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our suppliers could occur, which could lead to investigation by agencies responsible for consumer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged impact on product quality, our business, financial condition results of operations may be materially adversely affected. A significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand, reputation and image and negatively impact our sales, profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in circumstances where the financial consequences are not satisfied by one of our suppliers or covered by our product liability insurance, it may have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Even if future product liability claims against us are not successful, these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management’s time and resources from operating our business. Even if our own products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Risks related to an outbreak of a disease, such as COVID-19, in one of our stores, warehouses or distribution centers, or at one of our suppliers’ facilities, or at those of our competitors, may call into question the safety of our retail stores or product offerings. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns, and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy, 52 ----- which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative supplies or ingredients that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings.

We directly employed 205,769 people as of December 31, 2020, of which 27% were employed in France, 51% were employed in Brazil, 17% were employed in Colombia and 5% were employed in Argentina and Uruguay. Consequently, our success depends in part on our ability to manage our labor costs and its impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise our wages due to new labor laws or regulations, pressure exerted by trade unions or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which we operate. Furthermore, we are required to pay social security and other similar charges for our employees. These may increase over time or the laws and regulations setting forth any exonerations or other exemptions from payment of such charges from which we currently benefit may change, increasing our liabilities. For instance, the tax-exempt competitiveness and employment tax credit (“CICE”) to which French companies were entitled until 2018 has been replaced since 2019 with a reduction in an employer’s payroll-based contribution, which increased our tax base. Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our products, our profitability, business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. For example, certain of the Latin American operations of GPA, Assaí, and Grupo Éxito have been subject to government-mandated price controls on certain staple commodities which limit the prices they may set for these offerings. As a result, the rise of certain raw material and energy costs in these markets could have an immediate and direct material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, significant amounts of electricity and fuel are needed to regulate the temperature of and operate our stores, warehouses, data centers and maintain our cold chain requirements for appropriate storage of materials and products before they are sold in stores or delivered, and we cannot guarantee that our energy costs will not increase in the future.

(“Rallye”), which is itself controlled by Euris S.A.S. (“Euris”) through two intermediate holding companies (Finatis S.A. (“Finatis”) and Foncière Euris S.A. (“Foncière Euris”)). Euris is in turn controlled by Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer. In addition to Mr. Naouri, a representative of each of Euris, Finatis, Foncière Euris and Matignon Diderot S.A.S. (“Matignon Diderot”) (another affiliate of Rallye) holds a seat on the board of directors of the Issuer. As of the date hereof, the board of directors of the Issuer seats thirteen voting and two non-voting members in total. As a result of this ownership structure and the Issuer’s board composition, Rallye, its holding companies (especially Euris) and ultimately Mr. Naouri have considerable influence over our policies, day-to-day operations and strategic decisions. Rallye’s 54 ----- principal asset is the shares of the Issuer that it holds, nearly all of which have been pledged to secure outstanding debt of Rallye and its subsidiaries. During the second quarter of 2019, each of Rallye, its subsidiaries Cobivia S.A.S. (“Cobivia”), L’Habitation Moderne de Boulogne S.A.S. (“HMB”) and Alpétrol S.A.S. (“Alpétrol”), and Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris entered into safeguard proceedings through a ruling by the Commercial Court of Paris. Safeguard proceedings aim at protecting companies facing difficulties which they cannot overcome, while not being cash-flow insolvent by giving them sufficient time to organize the restructuring of their debt and ensure their sustainability. For a discussion of the rules governing safeguard proceedings in France, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”. Each of these safeguard proceedings was initiated after the court acknowledged the financial difficulties experienced by these companies. On September 25, 2019, Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris met with their banking partners to propose a draft safeguard plan, prepared with the assistance of judicial administrators, which was approved by the Commercial Court of Paris on February 28, 2020. Several creditors of Rallye filed a third-party opposition proceedings before the Paris commercial court in order to amend the safeguard plan. This proceeding is still ongoing. Each safeguard proceeding, and the approved safeguard plan, only concerns the entity for which it was initiated and as a result, none of them applies to the Issuer or any other entity in our Group. We have therefore continued to operate in the ordinary course of business while the safeguard proceedings were ongoing and since the safeguard plan was approved. The safeguard proceedings had only two direct impacts at the Issuer level: (i) the downgrading of the Issuer’s credit ratings and (ii) a temporary reduction in borrowings under the Issuer’s commercial paper program. Nevertheless, the public’s perception of the safeguard proceedings and future implementation of the safeguard plan could cause negative movements in our stock price and the trading price of the Notes and creditors to become reluctant to lend to us on favorable terms or at all. See “—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, and the Notes—There may not be an _active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited”._ Additionally, and in particular in light of its recent financial difficulties and in the context of implementing the safeguard plan, which will depend in part, on our ability to upstream cash, our controlling shareholder could vote to cause us to take actions that may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. For example, our controlling shareholder could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets, which might increase our debt service obligations or reduce our ability to generate net sales, to distribute funds at the expense of our financial condition or to pursue transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. Noteholders could be disadvantaged by any of these actions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our current strategy aims to maintain and reinforce our competitive position in our historical businesses’ key markets and formats, aim for leadership in and further development of our newer business activities and dispose of or reduce our stake in certain non-strategic assets and businesses. Failure to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources in furtherance of our identified strategy may negatively affect our planned initiatives. Moreover, our newer business activities in the France Retail segment, GreenYellow, relevanC and ScaleMax, are still in their development phase and consequently incurring associated development expenditures, which may not yield the results that we anticipate achieving within a certain time, or at all. Any misjudgments or flaws in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 55 ----- Offering a seamless customer experience by integrating innovative digital solutions and strengthening our e-commerce channel through various means, including strategic partnerships and acquisitions of new technologies, lies at the heart of our strategy for our business operations, especially in France. For example, in 2018, Monoprix partnered with Amazon to offer grocery items to Amazon Prime Now customers in Paris. In 2019, we expanded this partnership to include the sale of our private-label and Naturalia products on Amazon Prime Now, the expansion of delivery zones throughout France and the installation of Amazon Lockers in over 1,000 of our Group retail locations in France. By the end of 2020, our partnership with Amazon covered Paris, Nice, Lyon and Bordeaux, and is currently expanding to Montpellier in the first quarter 2021. In addition, in 2020, different banners of the Group established partnerships with other players in food delivery, such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo. Our ability to adapt to e-commerce developments and, in particular, to develop web-generated sales depends on a number of factors, including the ability to successfully market our websites, the ability to identify additional key partnerships for the expansion of our online channels, the capability of our existing distribution network to accommodate our growing online operations at a pace sufficient to keep up with customer demand and the ability to integrate our growing online operations. Historically, our e-commerce operations have been less profitable than our brick-and-mortar businesses and, as a result, the expected increased weight of e-commerce operations (both through our E-commerce segment and within our retail banners) could negatively impact our future profitability. Moreover, we are focused on improving the customer experience by adapting to consumer preferences for an increasingly multi-channel shopping experience, such as through in-app special discounts and purchases and autonomous store locations. Our strategy relies on identifying and acquiring or partnering with startup businesses which offer technology solutions that allow us to integrate innovative digital shopping processes into our operations. The Group is also pursuing certain cost-saving measures to maintain, and reduce, its cost base through optimizing head office expenses at the corporate level and at the level of each of our banners and reducing store costs, continuing to negotiate better purchasing conditions for goods, realizing logistics synergies through unifying the logistics serving our Casino and Franprix banners. See “—Business—Our _Strategies—Continued focus on profitability improvement and proactive deleveraging in France” and “— We may from time to time pursue acquisitions or disposals, both of which involve numerous risks, including relating to the integration of the acquired business, that could have an adverse impact on our business. Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations”. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be_ completed on the expected timeframe or at all. Further, there may be costs associated with these measures, such as potential early lease termination liabilities associated with strategic store closings. Moreover, all or any of these initiatives may fail to improve performance (or advance performance at a slower pace than planned) and, consequently, materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, operating results, financial condition or prospects. In addition, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help meet our objectives. For example, we are currently seeking to dispose of certain assets in France. We initially announced plans in 2018 to dispose of €1.5 billion in assets by the first quarter of 2020, which we later increased to €2.5 billion, and have since identified new asset disposals, amounting to an additional €2 billion, bringing our cumulative target amount under the Asset Disposal Plan to €4.5 billion, in furtherance of which €2.8 billion in disposals have been completed as of December 31, 2020. In executing our asset disposal plans, we may encounter difficulties in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may face other potential delays in the execution or timing of our disposal plans, such as, for example, delayed disposals due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also dispose of a business at a price, or on terms, less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may lose the benefit 56 ----- of certain synergies, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected and may have an adverse impact on our purchasing power with suppliers. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the disposition of a business or assets, we will be subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and government approvals on acceptable terms, that, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction on the terms initially anticipated, or at all. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial and commercial obligations. Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment, which may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In addition to our internal technology development initiatives and innovations, we rely in part on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to our online operations, including the industries in which Cdiscount operates, and to our solar power and energy efficiency operations, will continue to emerge.

Our agreements with these suppliers may be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses and have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations.","We have business relations with more than 66,000 suppliers, including in relation to our private label products. We are generally dependent on third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to meet timelines, provide us with sufficient product or comply with our specifications, including with respect to social or environmental matters. These risks are heightened in the 57 ----- context of suppliers who supply and/or manufacture our private label products. If a delay or interruption of delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able to meet consumer demand, which may result in fewer sales. Further, as we require our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the high quality of our products, the use of third-party suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel. If the products provided by our suppliers do not meet the relevant quality standards, our reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we depend on certain of our suppliers for certain of our successful popular brand products which contribute to store traffic and sales. Any disruption of delivery of these key high-volume products may have an adverse effect on our sales. We are subject to certain risks with respect to our suppliers’ potential non-compliance with social and environmental laws and regulations, including the risk of liability and penalties if we fail to comply with Law No. 2017-399, enacted in France in March 27, 2017, which requires a certain duty of care to ensure that human and environmental rights across the entire production chain are not infringed, and with commitments undertaken in the context of the United Nations Global Compact. Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets in particular presents risks in terms of non-compliance with labor laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, particularly in the context of textile and electronics manufacturing. In addition to non-compliance with labor laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from suppliers in foreign markets, including, among others, political instability; increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange rate risks; risks related to environmental matters, including those related to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation or waste management, or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our products are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation. Any of these risks, in isolation or in combination, could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no guarantee that we will maintain relationships with our suppliers, and at any point may be required to contract with other suppliers on less favorable terms and/or at a greater cost. For instance, there is a risk that smaller suppliers will consolidate, giving us fewer choices and resulting in increasing prices. Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition of stricter conditions by suppliers (especially with respect to stringent payment terms) or the non-renewal of our main supply agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure of our suppliers to comply with our social and environmental guidelines may result in harm to our reputation and brand, which may have a negative impact on our business, sustainability rating and financial position. If we experience a need to replace an existing supplier, including due to their noncompliance with our social and environmental guidelines, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us.

Out of our total store network, as of December 31, 2020, 6,892 stores were operated by franchisees, of which 5,422 stores were located in France (representing 50% of the total number of stores in our network and 71% of our French store network) and 1,470 stores are located in Colombia (representing 70% of the stores in Grupo Éxito’s network in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina). Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we mandate certain operational standards and procedures through our franchise agreements, we may not be able to respond quickly enough to franchisees that do not uphold these standards. Our franchised operations present a number of drawbacks, such as: - the risk that a successful franchisee whose operations produce significant revenue or a significant number of existing or future franchisees terminate their relationship with us or are unable to renew their franchise agreements with us for a number of reasons, including low sales volumes, high rental costs, lack of profitability or a desire to retire. Our franchisees may not be able to or may decide not to renew their franchise agreements, or they may terminate their relationships with us. If a substantial number of franchises are not renewed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

As listed public companies, these subsidiaries and other consolidated entities are subject to rules and regulations that impose various requirements, including the requirements to publish regular audited financial reports, and increased legal and financial compliance costs and governance requirements, such as a minimum number of independent board members. As a result, and because there may be significant minority shareholders in some of these subsidiaries, we may have restrictions on our ability to access or use assets, and settle liabilities of the Group. We also hold stakes in other, non-publicly listed companies that have significant minority shareholders. We fully consolidate GPA, Grupo Éxito, Assaí, Cnova and the other entities in which we have a controlling stake but in which there are significant minority shareholders in our consolidated financial statements. However, because we do not fully own these subsidiaries, we may have restrictions on our ability to access to their cash flows. To the extent that such subsidiaries will be considered restricted subsidiaries under the terms of the Indenture, we will be able to on-lend money to any such non-wholly-owned subsidiaries in an unrestricted manner. In addition, activities of our subsidiaries may expose us to risks related to our internal controls and reporting. For example, in 2016, Cnova identified material weaknesses in its internal controls in Brazil and restated its financial statements for the years ending on December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, following an internal investigation into accounting manipulation and internal misconduct to mislead Cnova’s auditors. Furthermore, GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture, including the provisions limiting the ability of these entities to incur indebtedness.

We expect that this proportion will continue to grow as we pursue our asset-light business strategy. Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our rental costs may increase pursuant to certain indices. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during renewals or to renew any expired lease on favorable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and perspective landlords. For example, given the main street location of many of our stores, we compete with a greater number of renters, resulting in increased rental charges for these properties. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than currently anticipated or if we were unable to renew any expired leases on commercially favorable terms, our financial performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, our increasing reliance on leases as a result of recent sales of real estate and the increasing rental expenses may have a negative impact on our business and these expenses could increase disproportionately to our growth, if any. Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may decide to close certain store locations that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our brands’ positioning. Our ability to enter into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail locations is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable commercial lease terms than we can. Moreover, in France, stores and other commercial installations whose area is over a certain threshold may require prior regulatory authorizations from local authorities.

Further, there may be certain types of losses with respect to which we may not be able to obtain insurance at all, for example it may not be possible to obtain insurance against losses from pandemic-related business interruptions. We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for 62 ----- damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. If we are not able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost or if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the global economy, major insurance companies around the world announced overall rate increases of 15% to 30%, with likely ensuing premium increases. This trend of rising insurance rates is expected to continue into 2021 and 2022. Particularly for our insurance policies covering business interruption and property damage, we expect premium increases of 10% to 12% upon renewal in July 2021 (for an additional cost of €1 million to €1.3 million per year). Our insurance coverage may not cover all risks and there are some risks that may only be covered to a limited extent due to limits in our insurance policies. For instance, we may incur losses that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for such losses could result in significantly higher expense than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.30,Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related risks may adversely affect our results of operations.,"Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in euro, however we also generate revenue denominated in other currencies, mainly the Brazilian real and the Colombian peso. Because our financial statements are presented in euro, the assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than the euro must be translated into euro at the applicable exchange rates, being the spot rate for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the average rate for sales and expenses for the applicable income statement period. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the euro may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-euro businesses in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their own currency, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2020, a 10% increase in the value of the euro relative to the Brazilian real would have resulted in a negative impact of €1,008 million on our total revenue, €54 million on our trading profit, €23 million on our net profit and €234 million on our equity. As of December 31, 2020, a 10% increase in the value of the euro relative to the Colombian peso would have resulted in a negative impact of €264 million on our net sales, €11 million on our trading profit, €5 million on our net profit and €130 million on our equity. We also engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions from time to time. Our hedging strategies may not adequately protect our results of operations from the effects of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations or may limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in such rates. Moreover, we may only have a limited ability to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk to reduce the sensitivity of our net profits and our cash flows to currency fluctuations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Total goodwill, which represents the excess of our acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired, was €6,656 million as of December 31, 2020, or 21.8% of our consolidated total assets. The value of any goodwill recorded on our financial statements may not be fully realizable upon a sale of all or part of the business or any other liquidity event. 63 ----- Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, any changes in the key assumptions used for internal calculations of values in use and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement. We can give no assurance that we will not record any goodwill impairments in the future. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity under IFRS.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations.","We have in the past acquired and may in the future from time to time acquire other companies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, expenses, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees, customers and vendors from either our current business or an acquired company’s business; inability to generate sufficient net sales to offset acquisition costs; additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; governance-related difficulties with existing minority shareholders; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses. Moreover, merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by the European Union and national laws and regulations could negatively impact our business if such laws and regulations prevent us from expanding our growth through the consummation of mergers or acquisitions in certain categories or oblige us to divest certain stores or activities that may have an impact on our market shares in some geographical areas, especially in Paris. For example, in the past, the Group was required to sell certain of its stores in anticipation of its acquisition of Monoprix at the request of the relevant competition authorities. At the same time, if smaller players in our markets are able to consolidate, this could increase the competitive pressure on our business due to an increase in such competitors’ economies of scale and a reduction in their operating costs. Moreover, our competitors might acquire smaller players in our markets, further strengthening their position in such markets. These events could cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we have in the past, and pursuant to our Asset Disposal Plan, will continue to strategically dispose of certain of our non-performing real estate and other assets in the near future. The success of our Asset Disposal Plan depends on market interest for the assets sold and our ability to maintain optimal management of operations of such assets during the transition phase. Further, even following a successful disposal, we face the risk of potential claims by the purchasers of our assets pursuant to liability guarantees typically provided during asset sales. There can be no assurance that planned acquisitions or disposals will be completed on the expected timeframes or at all. Moreover, all or any of these initiatives may fail to improve performance (or may advance performance at a slower pace than planned) and, 64 ----- consequently, materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, operating results, financial condition or prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.33,"We operate in markets which have historically been predominantly price deflationary, which can put pressure on profit margins.","In the non-food sector, after a product is introduced, the costs associated with the product’s average selling price typically decrease as the supply of such product becomes more prevalent in the market and new products are developed and introduced for sale. Accordingly, as is common in our non-food sectors of operation, particularly under our Cdiscount banner, we often expect to reduce the average price of products as a result of new product introductions, increases in sales volume or competitive pressures. There can be no guarantee that price deflation may drive increased sales volume sufficiently to counteract such effects, which may make it harder for us to maintain or grow our profit margin over a product’s life cycle. Where the effect of price deflation is not countered by an increase in sales volume, effective cost is crucial in maintaining or growing profit margins. If we are unable to maintain or grow our profit margins (for example, by shifting our product mix towards higher margin products by selecting and procuring products from suppliers that offer improved designs or preferred features), manage our inventory levels, manage costs or increase our sales volume, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Cdiscount’s ability to maintain a high number of visitors to its website is not entirely in its control, although it does invest in search engine advertising (“SEA”) through the purchase of advertising and keywords from search engines and employs search engine optimization (“SEO”) techniques. Major search engines may modify their search algorithms, and changes in these algorithms could cause its site to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit its site, as well as reduce its expected return from its SEA investment. Moreover, competitors’ SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than Cdiscount’s site. Negative online customer reviews could also lead search engines to down-rank Cdiscount’s site. In addition, sites must comply with search engine guidelines and policies. These guidelines and policies are complex and may change at any time. If Cdiscount fails to follow such guidelines and policies properly, search engines may rank its content lower in search results or could remove its content altogether from their results. If it is listed less prominently or fails to appear in such result listings for any reason, the number of visitors to Cdiscount’s sites can decline, which may affect our net sales and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business and Industry,13.1.35,Cdiscount is subject to risks associated with its status as a “hosting company”.,"As a provider of an online marketplace, Cdiscount is faced with unique risks associated with thirdparty sellers. Despite a quality control program, Cdiscount may be unable to prevent sellers offering products through its marketplaces from collecting payments, fraudulent or otherwise, when customers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are of inferior quality or materially different from the sellers’ representations. In certain instances, Cdiscount reimburses customers for payments in these situation; as it expands its marketplace business, the cost of reimbursing customers could increase and could negatively affect operating results. Cdiscount also may be unable to prevent sellers on its marketplace from selling goods in an unlawful manner without licenses, permits or otherwise, or selling 65 ----- counterfeit products, products whose sale violates the proprietary rights of others or products that do not meet safety standards. Moreover, many of Cdiscount’s marketplace sellers use their own facilities to store their products, and many of them use their own or third-party delivery systems to deliver their products to customers, which makes it difficult for Cdiscount to ensure that customers receive the same quality of service for all products. In addition, Cdiscount could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by sellers on its marketplaces. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and business. Furthermore, the law relating to Cdiscount’s potential liability for defective products sold by third parties on its online marketplace platform continues to evolve. The sale of products by third parties using Cdiscount’s service may increase its exposure to product liability claims and even criminal liability for the introduction of dangerous or defective products on such marketplaces. Further, the sale of defective products by marketplace vendors could lead to an investigation by regulatory agencies. Despite our established quality control program, Cdiscount’s reputation could be harmed if a marketplace vendor sells unlawful or unethical products. We believe we have hosting company status with respect to our French marketplace. As a result, we believe we are only liable for unlawful activities by sellers on our French marketplace after we have been notified of such activities and do not take any action to remedy the situation. However, if we were to lose our hosting status, we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by sellers on our French marketplace even if we were not aware of such unlawful activities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

We could face a wide variety of employee claims, including general discrimination, privacy, labor and employment and disability claims. In particular, following certain speculative attacks on the share capital of the Issuer starting in December 2015, we asked the AMF to initiate an investigation, which was opened in February 2016. On December 17, 2019, the AMF closed the investigation, publishing a press release stressing the importance of compliance with principles of honesty, fairness and impartiality for persons issuing investment recommendations, without taking any further action. Following further speculative attacks on the share capital of the Issuer in June 2018, the Group filed a formal complaint with the AMF, asking for action to be taken to halt the attacks and prosecute the perpetrators. In October 2018, the Group, along with its majority shareholder Rallye, filed a criminal complaint with France’s financial Public Prosecutor on the grounds of price manipulation, dissemination of false or misleading information, as well as insider trading, followed in November 2018 by the filing of another criminal complaint for false allegations with the Paris Public Prosecutor. Such speculative attacks on the share capital of the Issuer continued in 2019. To the knowledge of the Group, the procedures opened by the AMF and the Public Prosecutor in late 2018 are still in progress. Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual, accounting 66 ----- and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and legal expenses. Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the distraction of management resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters,13.2.2,"We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations and increased scrutiny from regulators and enforcement authorities which could impose substantial liabilities and costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent international, national and local laws and regulations such as laws on labor, competition, imports and exports, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, supplier relations, urban planning approvals for the opening of new stores, business operations, stock exchange, product safety, intermediation in consumer credit and insurance, information technology, store safety and accessibility, occupational health and environment. For example, as a retailer, we are subject to regulation by consumer protection authorities, such as the French _Direction générale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes (“DGCCRF”). Such authorities enforce compliance with a host of consumer-related laws and regulations, including rules on advertising style and content, the nature, composition and labelling of products supplied, legally mandated minimum information to be provided to consumers before they make a purchase, product safety and customer service processes. These laws and regulations have tended to become more stringent and more expansive over time, and enforcement has tended to increase over time. We are also subject to regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our operational flexibility. Such regulations are subject to frequent change, which may materially impact our business operations, and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines. Changes in such regulations could have an impact on our business operations. Moreover, our Group is and has been a party to several purchasing alliances including INCA-A, which was operational from October 2014 and April 2018, and Horizon, which has been operational since February 2019. Purchasing alliances have recently been the subject of increased scrutiny from the European Commission under competition laws. Competition authorities have the ability to impose significant fines or impose limitations on the scope of these alliances for violations of competition law. We are also subject to labor and employment laws that regulate our employees’ working conditions, maximum working hours and, in certain jurisdictions such as France, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work on Sundays. We may be subject to audits and/or inquiries into our labor law practices by competent authorities, and enforcement costs can be significant. Additionally, as a retailer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to stringent production, packing, health, quality, labeling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and our suppliers’ facilities is subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities, including European, national and local health, environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, fire and safety departments. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution center. Our stores, our outsourced distribution centers and our suppliers’ production 67 ----- facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Despite the precautions we undertake or require our suppliers to undertake, should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut down the store, distribution center or facility concerned and levy a fine for such noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we are subject to various environmental, health and safety requirements, including those governing discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the cleanup of contaminated sites, product content and labeling and worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup obligations, fines, penalties and other sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage, as a result of violations of our liabilities under these requirements. For example, we own and operate gas stations in France and abroad, and as a result we are subject to a variety of European directives and regulations, as well as national and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations governing the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products. As a result, we may face liability for any violations of such requirements and for any environmental impacts from current or historical operations at such locations (including those that are identified in the future). In particular, our service stations in France are classified facilities (installations classées pour la protection de l’environnement)_ and subject to regulation and oversight relating to their use of potentially hazardous substances and other environmental impacts. Our operations and facilities also require permits and authorizations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which are subject to renewal, modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur substantial capital or other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future. Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific regulations, compliance with each of which can be complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These include compliance with banking and personal finance regulations by Floa Bank in France and by GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito’s consumer finance businesses FIC and Tuya in Brazil and Colombia, respectively, compliance with ecommerce laws and regulations, compliance with real estate laws and regulations by our subsidiary Sudeco and compliance with laws and regulations affecting the solar energy sector by our GreenYellow business; subsidies for green energy in France have an impact on GreenYellow’s results. In addition, as a public company with shares listed in France, we are subject to rules and regulations that impose various requirements, including the requirements to publish regular audited financial reports, and increased legal and financial compliance costs and governance requirements, such as a minimum number of independent board members. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Compliance with future requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could subject us to sanctions which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As a general matter, legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements, our ability or the ability of our employees, partners or shareholders to fully comply with these requirements, or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our employees may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is the case for other 68 ----- retailers of our size, we are subject to inquiries and investigations from regulatory bodies, such as consumer protection agencies or competition authorities or financial regulators, in the ordinary course of our business. Authorities may take the view that we are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

We also have loyalty programs as part of our marketing strategy, which allow us to gather information about our customer base. In order for our business to function successfully, we must be able to handle and transmit confidential information, including credit and debit card information, securely. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations could adversely affect our reputation and brands and may result in claims, fines, civil or criminal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Moreover, even if we are compliant with such laws and requirements, we may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations on privacy at the international, national and state or local level in all of our operating countries. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to legal risk. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, which regulates data protection, privacy and the transfer of EU citizens’ personal data, and which became applicable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers and employees increased control over their personal data. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in fines of a threshold percentage of our global net sales. The Latin American operations of GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito are also subject to similar data protection laws. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, consumer protection and the digital advertising business are evolving and subject to potentially different interpretations.

For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase and raise our operating expenses and adversely affect our profits. For example, credit card companies in Brazil tend to impose stringent payment terms by charging higher commissions than they do in France; they also typically settle 69 ----- transactions approximately 30 days after a sale is made, as compared to the one-day turnaround that is typical for transaction settlement in France, which can have an adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult for us to comply. There is also a risk that information from customers’ credit or debit cards could be misappropriated. A failure by us to comply with applicable requirements or regulations may subject us to fines, the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or the cessation of payments from credit and debit card providers to us for purchases already made.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments, possibly with a retroactive effect. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, the current incorporation into European and French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017 and ratified by France on September 26, 2018, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. The European Union is itself pursuing its work on the harmonization of the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 (Council Directive 2017/952) (the “ATAD 2”), which, _inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) since January 1, 2020. Amongst the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted EBITDA or to a maximum amount of €3 million, per financial year, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions, notably in certain cases of thin capitalization. Such rules apply as from January 1, 2019 further to the transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) of the general interest limitation rule provided for by the ATAD. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code (code général des impôts) (the “FTC”). See “—French tax _legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus increasing our taxable basis and reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on these rules. Furthermore, Article 108 of the French Finance_ Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law as from January 1, 2019, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities might ignore, for the determination of corporate income tax, an arrangement or a series of arrangements which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The condition relating to the absence of genuineness of 70 ----- the arrangement or series of arrangements would be met if such arrangement or series of arrangements were established for invalid commercial reasons. This reinforces the arsenal of the French tax authorities in the fight against abusive arrangements (without providing for specific penalties), other provisions being primarily focused on solely tax-driven schemes. The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It should be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. In this respect, the European Commission has published its work program for 2020, which indicates that the CCCTB should receive priority attention this year. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Another area of uncertainty concerns the progressive decrease of the French statutory corporate income tax rate provided for by Article 219 of the FTC to 25% (or from 34.43% to 25.83% by taking into account the 3.3% social contribution provided for by Article 235 ter ZC of the FTC which applies in addition to the French statutory corporate income tax rate) for companies whose corporate income tax charge exceeds €763,000) over a period of four years starting in 2019. Indeed, the pace of such decrease has been amended several times to address budget constraints of the French State since its first enactment by the end of 2018. Currently, for companies generating a French turnover of less than €250 million, the French corporate income tax rate is reduced to 26.5% (or 27.37% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. In addition, companies generating a French turnover exceeding €250 million pay French corporate income tax at the rate of 27.5% (or 28.41% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. For fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the French statutory corporate income tax rate will in principle be reduced to 25% (or 25.83% including the above mentioned additional 3.3% social contribution) for all companies. In recent years, fiscal policy has also focused on the tax treatment of internet businesses, and the ways in which tax laws can be adapted to tax e-commerce. This area is still unsettled and there is a risk that any of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business could alter their tax laws in a way that would materially increase the tax rate applicable to our E-commerce business. In this respect, the French tax bill, released by the French government on March 6, 2019 and enacted by the French Parliament on July 24, 2019, contains provisions on the taxation of numerical businesses which are now subject to a 3% tax on the turnover realized in France by companies whose portion of their turnover associated to numerical activities exceeds €750 million worldwide out of which €25 million may be attributed to French users. In the context of the negotiations within the OECD, the French tax authorities had suspended the payment of this tax for fiscal year 2020 to take into account the potential adoption of a similar tax at the international level. However, these negotiations being at a standstill, the French tax authorities have later announced in October 2020 that the above-mentioned tax would effectively be collected in December 2020. Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we are located or operate or may be located or may operate may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to our operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on our interpretations of French or foreign tax laws and regulations, in particular those of Brazil and Colombia, in which we generate a significant portion of our net sales. Our interpretation of and 71 ----- compliance with such laws is frequently the subject of review and inquiry from competent tax authorities. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that our tax compliance may be frequently challenged, particularly in the above-mentioned jurisdictions (and also in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations). More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we are located or operate may result in reassessments, late payment interests, fines and penalties. In addition, we benefit from significant tax incentives granted by Brazilian states and may obtain additional tax incentives in the future. However, we cannot guarantee that these tax incentives will remain in force, that the legality of these tax incentives is not, or will not in the future be, questioned by third parties such as the Brazilian attorney general or other Brazilian states, or that we will be able to replace these incentives if they are suspended or cancelled in the future. If these tax incentives are no longer in place, we may be retroactively subject to the taxes (and related penalties) that were not paid in the past due to such tax incentives.

The EU List was established following a screening and a dialogue conducted by a code of conduct working group appointed by the Council during 2017 with a large number of third country jurisdictions to improve tax good governance globally, and to ensure that the EU’s international partners respect the same standards as EU Member States do. The Black List, which shall be updated at least once a year, is currently (according to the list as of February 22, 2021) composed of 12 jurisdictions (American Samoa, Anguilla, Dominica, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands and Vanuatu). Furthermore, the Council published a Grey List of screened jurisdictions that committed to introduce changes in their tax legislation in order to comply with the European Union screening criteria. Though there is no applicable sanction yet, EU Member States are encouraged by the Council Conclusions to agree on coordinated sanctions to apply at national level against these listed jurisdictions, such as increased monitoring and audits, withholding taxes, special documentation requirements and anti-abuse provisions.

For example, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, our subsidiaries GPA and Assaí, which have American depositary shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and their subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. We operate in certain parts of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our employees. Further, we must comply with EU sanctions and any other applicable sanctions. Sanctions can change frequently (and often without advance notice) and we cannot guarantee that aspects of our current business will not be subject to sanctions in the future. U.S. sanctions principally apply to U.S. persons and, as a non-U.S. company, we are not required to comply with such sanctions. Nonetheless, certain aspects of our business may be impacted by U.S. sanctions that target jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Venezuela. In January 2010, the Venezuelan governmental authorities ordered the nationalization of the Group’s stores operating in Venezuela through Cativen S.A., which has since been renamed Red de Abastos Bicentenario S.A. (“Cativen”). In November 2010, the Group signed an agreement with the Government of Venezuela pursuant to which we disposed of 80.1% of our share capital in Cativen in exchange for $622.5 million, paid in installments of cash and dollar-denominated notes issued by the Venezuelan state, the last payment of which was received in November 2011. The Group has not received any dividend from Cativen since the signature of this agreement. In particular, U.S. sanctions against Venezuela have targeted the Government of Venezuela, which could impact our minority stake in Cativen, which is majority owned by the Government of Venezuela. Other than as set out above, we do not conduct any business in Venezuela. Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our reputation and consequently, our ability to win future business.

By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC provides that, in respect of a given tax year, interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (codified under Article 212 bis of the FTC), the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is now limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its tax adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and thirdparty financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that establishes eligible consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to allow additional deduction of net financial expenses for companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity (fonds propres) over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong for accounting purposes. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount (the “75%",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. The new provisions also cover, inter alia, reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent in its country of establishment but the jurisdiction of its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly an aggregate of more than 50% of the voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit, qualify the entity as non-transparent. In this situation, the entity would be treated as taxable in its jurisdiction of establishment (either at the level of the entity or at the level of its shareholders or partners). The above-mentioned tax rules, as well as generally applicable tax principles, may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The portion of our debt bearing interest at a variable rate may further increase in the future, including as a result of our decision to enter into market instruments such as interest rate swaps. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, several regulators and law enforcement agencies of EU Member States, as well as the European Union itself, are conducting investigations into whether banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR or EURIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR or EURIBOR. As a result, EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates that are indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of recent and ongoing national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”), which was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 29, 2016 and has applied since January 1, 2018. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU. It will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EUsupervised entities of benchmarks operated by administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). These reforms, including the Benchmarks Regulation, may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service debt on drawings under 82 ----- the Revolving Credit Facility or our other debt linked to such a benchmark (including fixed-rate debt that we have converted to variable-rate debt via interest rate swaps). In particular, the Benchmarks Regulation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and our other debt linked to such a benchmark if the methodology or other terms of the LIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the LIBOR benchmark. In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark, including LIBOR, and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have, inter alia, the following effects on certain benchmarks such as LIBOR: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to such benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmarks or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. On July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12, 2018 and the announcement dated March 5, 2021), the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcements”). The FCA Announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR or EURIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of any debt linked to such benchmark, or result in other consequences in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR or EURIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt on drawings under our existing and future indebtedness that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Furthermore, it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist in the future or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our existing and future indebtedness may increase and we may need to renegotiate certain of our indebtedness to replace LIBOR with a new standard. In addition, the issues that may lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR may make one or more of the alternative methods impossible or impracticable to determine. Further, there can be no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined under our various financings, including the Other Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities, the Existing EMTN Bonds, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, we may be obligated to prepay all or a portion of the amounts outstanding thereunder. It is possible that we may not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to repurchase any or all of the Notes, or the restrictions under our then-existing 83 ----- contractual obligations may not allow us to make such required repurchases. Our failure to repurchase any or all of the Notes, as applicable, would be an event of default under the Indenture, and would cause a crossdefault under our other financings. Except as described under “Description of the Notes”, the Indenture governing the Notes will not contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture governing the Notes may not protect you in the event of highly leveraged transactions and other important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings or mergers that may adversely affect you, because these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial interest of the magnitude required to trigger the change of control provisions or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture expressly permits certain third parties to obtain control of the Issuer without any obligation to make a change of control offer if such third parties are one or more “Permitted Holders” or a “Successor Parent” as defined in the Indenture. For instance, if Rallye S.A., the Issuer’s controlling shareholder on the Issue Date, were to have, directly or indirectly, a new controlling shareholder, such event would not constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture as that new controlling shareholder would be considered a “Permitted Holder”. By contrast, if secured creditors of Rallye S.A. were to take control of the portion of the Issuer’s shares that Rallye S.A. has pledged to them, and such creditors are deemed to be a “group” for purposes of the applicable U.S. securities laws, such enforcement may constitute a “Change of Control” under the Indenture if they would hold more than 50% of the voting rights in the Issuer. Furthermore, the definition of “Change of Control” under the Indenture will include a disposition to any person of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

In this respect, where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds 1.5 times the company’s equity (fonds propres) during a financial year, measured, at the company’s option, at the opening or the close of such financial year, the company is regarded as thinly capitalized and the net financial expenses borne by such entity related to (i) financing granted by unrelated parties and (ii) financing granted by related parties up to 1.5 times the company’s equity (fonds propres) will be deductible up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of (i) 30% of the company’s tax-adjusted EBITDA and (ii) €3 million per fiscal year multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the FTC plus 1.5 times the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year), divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year.

Nevertheless, the interest deductibility restriction provided for by these amended thincapitalization rules is not applicable if the borrowing company is able to demonstrate that the overall debtto-equity ratio of the accounting group (as determined under accounting consolidation rules) to which it belongs is higher than its own debt-to-equity ratio (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year). In addition, when a company falls within the scope of French thin-capitalization rules, it is not allowed to benefit from the 75% Additional Deduction. Financial expenses that are disallowed by virtue of the application of the 30% Limitation (and, as the case may be, after application of the 75% Additional Amount) can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion disallowed as a result of the application of the 10% limitation will only be eligible for carryforward for one third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year might also be used over the following five tax years, but only against financial expenses incurred in those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French taxconsolidated groups. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, in particular the following: (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39,12 of the FTC which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group.

On October 10, 2016, the European Commission was tasked with the drafting of the legislation that will be submitted to the Participating Member States. However, and despite several attempts, no agreement has been found between the Participating Member States so far. At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the EU FTT reported a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model at a minimum rate of 0.2% which in principle would only concern acquisition of shares of listed companies whose market capitalization exceeds EUR 1 billion on December 1 of the preceding year and whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to changes until a final approval. In a report to the European Council on tax issues on December 9, 2019, the ECOFIN Council further reminded that should an informal agreement among Participating Member States be reached, it would only be a preliminary step in the legislative process in view of the adoption of a directive and any future formal agreement should be preceded by an inclusive and substantial debate among all Member States. In addition, the European Commission has published its work program for 2020, which indicates that the EU FTT should receive priority attention this year.

In the context of this agreement, a roadmap has been drafted and plans for the creation of new resources, including the EU FTT, will be proposed by the European Commission to finance such a package. The European Commission will work to make relevant proposals by June 2024. However, no final agreement has been reached yet. The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation also remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.

We offer both brand-name and private label food and consumer products through traditional retail stores as well as e-commerce food and non-food websites and apps. We also provide business-to-business and business-to-consumer services through our portfolio of complementary lines of business. Our retail banners operate under formats which aim to adapt to current consumer trends and needs across the various geographies in which we operate. Our premium retail format offers many innovative services and a high-quality shopping experience. Our convenience retail format is adapted to both city centers and rural areas, offering everyday basics to meet the expectations of customers seeking quality, authenticity and service. Our hypermarket, cash & carry and discount retail formats offer a wide range of quality products at affordable prices. We believe most of our banners enjoy leading market positions in most of our markets. We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed an omni-channel offering that we believe has favorably positioned us to respond to evolving consumer trends. We have developed partnerships with leading innovators such as Amazon and Ocado in order to provide best-in-class digital offer and grocery delivery services in France, as well as with Uber Eats and Deliveroo. We also offer customers in France hundreds of stores with autonomous solutions that provide a convenient and seamless retail experience, allowing customers to shop in the evening or on Sunday without the need to go through a physical checkout. Our pure-play e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, is the second largest non-food e-tailer in France by UMV and has allowed us to offer a range of adjacent business-to-consumer and business-to-business services. In France, Brazil and Colombia, our brick-and-mortar retail banners benefit from mobile applications and other e-commerce functionality that allow us to provide targeted promotions to our customers and give our customers the flexibility to shop how they want, when they want. We have developed a number of other complementary business lines that allow us to use our knowhow while monetizing our asset base. Through our subsidiary, GreenYellow, we have become a leader in photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency with a diverse customer portfolio and an expanding platform of innovative energy solutions. In addition, these businesses also include real estate development and shopping center management, consumer finance and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via relevanC and ScaleMax, respectively. We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other international markets. 96 ----- For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €31,912 million in net sales and €2,742 million in EBITDA and our France Retail and E-commerce segments recorded net sales of €17,256 million and EBITDA of €1,580 million. We operate our business in three reporting segments: - Our _France Retail_ segment includes our French retail banners (including online sales associated with such banners, but excluding Cdiscount), our ancillary business activities in France (including GreenYellow, relevanC and ScaleMax) and our Indian Ocean operations, which were sold in June 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our France Retail segment generated €15,219 million in net sales. - Our E-commerce segment consists of our Cdiscount online retail business, which we hold through our 78.9% economic interest (as of December 31, 2020) in Cnova N.V. and which is fully consolidated in our financial statements. References to the financial performance of Cdiscount in this Offering Memorandum refer to Casino’s E-commerce reporting segment.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.1,General economic conditions in our geographic markets,"The retail sector is particularly susceptible to swings in demand due to general economic conditions. Our results of operations are therefore affected by specific economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, as well as, to a lesser extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include levels of employment, inflation, growth in gross domestic product, average and minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit (especially for the purchase of non-food goods), consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend. We generate a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of food and other non-discretionary items, demand for which is generally not as sensitive to macroeconomic conditions as demand for discretionary consumer goods. Nevertheless, economic downturns may still have an adverse impact on the sale of such items as consumers may reduce the overall amount they spend, by purchasing more entry-level products and/or shopping at stores operating under lower-cost formats, such as cash & carry or hard discount stores. Even when consumers switch to our banners operating under such formats, entry-level products and banners with a low-price positioning tend to be structurally less profitable. As a result, our 97 ----- profitability may be adversely impacted if the mix of formats generating our sales changes significantly as a result of economic conditions. While our business and results of operations may be, and have in the past been, affected by adverse economic conditions in the individual markets in which we operate, we have a diversified geographic footprint in France and, through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, and have generally benefited in recent years from positive macroeconomic trends in the various countries in which we principally conduct business. For example, the International Monetary Fund (the “IMF”) ranked France the seventh-largest economy in the world and the third-largest economy in Europe in terms of gross domestic product (“GDP”), which amounted to €2,130 billion in 2020. The French economy grew 1.5% in real terms in each of 2018 and 2019, and is estimated to have contracted by 9.0% in 2020, according to the IMF. France’s economic growth is largely driven by three regions: Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, which, although accounting for 39% of the French population (excluding French overseas territories) in 2019, generated 49% of France’s GDP in that year, according to the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). Approximately 69% of our 2020 France retail net sales were generated in these three regions. Due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various lockdowns that occurred in the spring and autumn of 2020, our markets recorded contractions in GDP for the year ended December 31, 2020 and previously projected future growth rates have been revised downward as a result of lingering economic effects of the pandemic. For example, the French economy is estimated to have contracted by 9.0% in 2020 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 0.5% between 2019 and 2024, according to the IMF. Latin American GDP has also been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Brazilian economy, which was the largest economy in South America in 2019, grew 1.1% in real terms in 2018 and 2019, it contracted by 4.5% in 2020 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 0.7% between 2019 and 2024, according to the IMF. The Colombian economy, which had faced a growth slowdown in recent years, but started recovering with growth of 2.5% in real terms in 2018 and 3.3% in real terms in 2019, is projected to contract by 8.2% in real terms in 2020, according to the IMF. The IMF estimates that Colombian GDP is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3% between 2019 and 2024. For a further discussion of the macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which our businesses are present and the trends affecting their growth, see “Industry”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.2,The COVID-19 pandemic,"As a retailer, we have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the various health protection measures that have been taken by the governments of the countries in which we operate. As an essential provider of necessary goods, our stores were largely able to continue operations throughout the periods of lockdowns experienced in our markets and we have benefited from increases in demand for certain essential goods during the period. In addition, while we have observed a drop in footfall at our stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions, we have also observed a general trend toward larger basket sizes, which has compensated for this drop in footfall. However, we have also been adversely impacted by government-imposed restrictions on stores and shopping malls (e.g., closures of stores, restrictions on sales of some product categories, limitations on store capacity). While we expect that a broad decline in new cases and the rollout of vaccines in the markets in which we operate will permit the gradual lifting of these restrictions, a resurgence in cases or the discovery of new variants could result in the extension or re-imposition of store closures, capacity limitations or other similar restrictions. 98 ----- Moreover, through the development of our E-commerce segment and various e-commerce channels in our other segments (such as click and collect, delivery partnerships with Amazon Prime, Ocado and others), we were able to benefit from the accelerated shift in consumer habits to online shopping that took place during the first half of 2020. We experienced significant growth in food e-commerce during the first half of 2020, thanks to this shift in consumer habits and the deployment of click and collect and home delivery solutions for banners in our urban and convenience formats. During the first half of 2020, this resulted in a strong positive impact on France Retail net sales leading to an additional €80 million margin. This increase, however, was more than offset by temporary additional costs related to maintaining our operations under challenging conditions, particularly during the lockdowns that were imposed in certain of the countries or regions in which we operate. These costs included for France Retail: - additional logistics costs (€27 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), including extra transport costs, costs associated with organizational issues relating to problems with supplier deliveries and the non-application of logistics-related penalties; - additional staff costs (€28 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), including the hiring of extra staff, wages for working night-time hours and employer contributions for employees on sick leave or at home minding their children; - additional health and safety costs (€38 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020), including emergency mass purchases of face masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, the purchase and installation of Plexiglas screens, reinforced store cleaning, and hiring security guards to regulate the distance between customers; and - the payment of a special one-time employee bonus of €37 million in the first half of 2020. This resulted in a net negative impact on trading profit related to the COVID-19 health crisis of €50 million in the first half of 2020. These costs were primarily temporary in nature. During the second half of 2020, we recorded costs of €5 million per quarter related to the COVID19 health crisis. Our France (including Cdiscount) gross sales under banner recorded same-store growth of 3.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, despite the second lockdown in France, which lasted approximately one month during November 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,Competitive environment,"Our results of operations are affected by the competitive pressures we face across our various business lines. We operate in extremely competitive markets, and the retail sector as a whole has recently undergone significant changes, primarily as a consequence of the increasing reach of the internet and the resulting changes in consumer purchasing behavior. Our brick-and-mortar retail business faces competition from international and domestic brick-andmortar retailers, generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, specialists (including home delivery distributors) and convenience stores. In addition, our pure e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, and, to a lesser extent, our brick-and-mortar banners with e-commerce operations, also face intense competition, both from other e-commerce providers and from brick-and-mortar retailers with e-commerce operations. Retailers are increasingly introducing and improving their internet distribution platforms. Barriers to entry for e-commerce are low, and current and new competitors can launch new e-commerce platforms at a relatively low cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful e-commerce companies. 99 ----- In certain instances, price competition can be curtailed by applicable regulation. For example, our French hypermarkets are subject to the French law of October 30, 2018, which is also known as the Égalim Law (the “Égalim Law”), which limits the ability of food retailers to sell certain categories of products to consumers at a loss. The Égalim Law also limits food retailers’ ability to carry out promotional campaigns for food products for a trial period of two years. For a more detailed description of the Égalim Law, see “Regulation—Restrictions on Promotions of Food Items”. We believe we benefit from leading positions in many of our segments, which is reflected in strong market positioning in the key markets in which we operate, as described by third-party sources. For a further discussion of the market position of certain of our banners, see “Industry”. We monitor the competitive environment of our markets and their trends at a country and banner level in the short term, and react to such trends by adjusting our pricing and product mix and carrying out promotional or loyalty campaigns. In the medium term, we also monitor our mix of formats and banners and seek out opportunities to increase multi-channel sales. We also seek to identify and execute opportunities to grow our store network, develop new concepts and adapt our mix of formats to meet customer demand and respond to market trends. We accomplish these goals through franchise transactions, strategic acquisitions and disposals, and identifying and developing store formats and banners tailored to the different locations in which they operate.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.4,Seasonality and comparability of results,"Our net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal variations due to consumers’ shopping habits and weather conditions. As a result of these variations, comparisons of consecutive interim periods may not be a good indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may bias year-on-year comparisons of interim periods. _Impact on net sales and trading profit_ Across all our businesses, seasonal fluctuations have a significant impact on our trading profit, the majority of which is generated in the second half of the year, which includes such peak holiday periods as the lead-up to Christmas. For example, net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2020 represented 51% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on the relevant average exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (or 49% based on the relevant average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020), while trading profit for the six months ended June 30, 2020 represented 28% of trading profit for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on the relevant average exchange rates for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (or 27% based on the relevant average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020). _Impact on working capital and net debt_ Food and non-food retail activity tend to significantly increase in the period leading to the holidays at the end of the year, reaching a peak in December. Ahead of such peak holiday periods, we will increase inventory to prepare for anticipated demand. In particular, Cdiscount is generating an increasing amount of net sales in connection with its annual Black Friday promotions in November (the precise date of which varies from year to year). Black Friday also has an increasingly positive effect on non-food sales during the fourth quarter in Brazil. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory during or ahead of these peak periods can affect our working capital requirements. In addition, any store closures during peak periods may in particular adversely affect our working capital requirements, 100 ----- and we may not always be able to avoid having to carry out such closures, whether they be temporary or permanent, during peak periods. These seasonal fluctuations have an even greater impact on the cash flows generated by the Group. Our liquidity requirements fluctuate during the year and are normally at their highest in the first and third quarter of each year. At the beginning of the financial year, our cash and cash equivalents generally decrease significantly, as we then tend to make large payments to our suppliers for goods purchased to meet strong demand in the previous December, leading to significant cash outflows. During the summer, the business ordinarily registers a peak in sales due to its strong exposure to touristic geographies. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental lockdown measures, certain areas with strong exposure to tourism, such as Paris, experienced a downturn in consumption, in particular in the summer, resulting from, among other factors, the drop in tourism. The ordinary trend reverses in September when the working capital is impacted by both lower sales volumes and lower payables linked to the payments of the goods bought during the summer peak. _Calendar Effects_ We also experience calendar effects based on when certain holidays that are not celebrated on a fixed date fall in any given year and on changes in the number of occurrences of certain selling days of the calendar week from one period to the next. For example, we experience strong seasonality in our results for the months of March or April as a result of the Easter holiday, which may fall in either our first or our second fiscal quarter of any given year. In order to facilitate comparisons of our net sales, we present net sales in this Offering Memorandum as adjusted for calendar effects, which includes the impact of the change in the number of selling days per calendar week from one year to the next (that is, an increase or a decrease in the number of selling days in year N compared to year N-1 over a given period) and the impact of calendar differences concerning selling days that traditionally see a significant surge or drop in net sales (such as public holidays, school holidays, long weekends, major promotional campaigns, seasonal sale periods and key holidays). When presenting organic growth and same-store growth in net sales, we exclude the impact of calendar differences from one period to the next (“Calendar Effects”). Such calendar differences are twofold: - change in days of the week (“DOWs”), or the change in the number of selling days per calendar week from one period to the next. For example, if in a particular month in period N-1, there were more Saturdays than in the same month in period N, sales in that month in period N would tend to be lower (all other things being equal), because, for most formats in the retail industry, greater sales are generated on a Saturday than other days of the week; and - change in special sales days (“SSDs”), or the impact of calendar differences with respect to days that traditionally see a significant surge or drop in net sales. SSDs include public holidays (when stores are closed and thus record no sales), holidays and long weekends (such as Easter or Christmas where sales tend to be higher), major promotional campaigns (such as sales to mark a banner’s anniversary) and unusual events that can affect seasonality (such as the soccer World Cup). We calculate the Calendar Effect when analyzing changes in net sales from period to period, based on daily sales for a particular month in period N, as the percentage change from such month in period N-1 to the same month in period N of the impact of difference in DOWs and SSDs. For a given month in period 101 ----- N and the same month in period N-1, the percentage change in net sales due to calendar effects is the sum of: - the impact of differences in DOWs, which we calculate as (a) (i) for any particular DOW that occurs more frequently in a particular month in period N than it did in period N-1, the difference in the number of occurrences multiplied by the forecast average sales generated on such DOW (excluding SSDs) in period N _minus_ (ii) for any particular DOW that occurred more frequently in a particular month in period N-1 than it does in period N, the difference in the number of occurrences multiplied by the forecast average sales generated (excluding SSDs) on such DOW in period N, _divided by (b) total monthly sales for the month in period N-1; and - the impact of SSDs, which we calculate as (a) (i) the sales forecast on SSDs in the month in period N in excess of what typical days are expected to generate, _minus (ii) the sales generated on SSDs in the same month in period N-1 in excess of what typical days generated, divided by (b) total monthly sales for the month in period N-1. We calculate Calendar Effects for each period in advance and therefore such effects are calculated using the forecast average sales generated on a particular DOW or SSD prepared by management, rather than historical actual figures. Such forecasts are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties subject to change, and they may differ from actual results for the relevant period. In addition, the preparation of such forecasts requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum that incorporate Calendar Effects. _Weather_ Furthermore, adverse weather (such as heavy rains or snowfall) can deter customers from shopping in our stores, and unforeseen weather conditions (for example, unseasonably cold spells in summer) could render a portion of our non-food inventory (for example, fans and air-conditioning units) incompatible with such unseasonal conditions. _Sensitivity of our cost structure_ Excluding purchases of goods sold, we have a largely fixed cost base in the short to medium-term, which does not fluctuate with sales volumes. Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period based on changes in the size of our network of stores and the sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs to a certain degree, such as those related to marketing and labor (via short-term and interim contracts), but must maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the rise in our expenses in order to maintain or improve our margins. However, certain expenses, such as rental and energy costs, are, for the most part, beyond our control. Moreover, while we can adjust the size of our workforce, we are subject to laws setting minimum wages in each of the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions in our ability to reduce our workforce in France, which further limits our operational flexibility. See “Risk _Factors—Risks related to our business and industry— Increases in labor costs and social charges and changes to wage regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”. We actively seek to control our costs and as recently as the third quarter of 2020 launched a_ plan to reduce headquarters and store costs, which had a €60 million positive impact in the second half of 2020, and which we expect to continue to have an impact in the short term. 102 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

We have historically expanded our network through targeted acquisitions of existing banners and the opening of new stores (both integrated stores owned by us and franchised stores) under banners we already own. We also regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and have sought to right-size our footprint through closures and disposals of stores. For example, since 2018, we have been implementing a plan (the “Rocade Plan”) pursuant to which we have undertaken a thorough review of our structurally loss-making stores in France and have been disposing of or closing such stores. As of December 31, 2020, we had completed disposals of stores for an aggregate sale price of €220 million under the Rocade Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred non-recurring costs of €43 million in connection with the disposals of our integrated stores. Our results and our margins are also affected by the evolution of the mix between our integrated stores (those that we own and operate) and stores owned by franchisees in our network, as net sales from our integrated stores add leases and personnel costs to our cost structure. In addition, we generally incur initial and ongoing capital expenditures and pre-opening costs with each new integrated store, whereas, pursuant to our franchise arrangements, the cash impact on our Group for adding new franchised stores is more limited. As a result, the net sales and margin impact of each new franchised store, while lower in absolute terms, tends to be higher in proportion to the investments required by us than the net sales and margin impact of each new integrated store. We have two principal types of franchising arrangements: - joint ventures set up between us and a master franchisee that in turn owns one or more franchised stores and pursuant to which we either fully consolidate (in the case of stores in which we own a controlling stake) or recognize our share of net income of the results of such stores (in the case of stores in which we do not own a controlling stake), which have historically represented the method by which Franprix and Leader Price stores have been franchised; and - franchise contracts pursuant to which a franchisee pays a fee to license the rights to a banner and receives a fixed allowance from us to set up the store. Such franchisees mostly purchase products through our central purchasing agency and we recognize as net sales the amounts we receive from the franchised stores which we do not consolidate for such wholesale transactions. As of December 31, 2020, 5,422 of the stores in our network in France were franchises, of which 4,528 were convenience stores. Historically, we have franchised out a number of underperforming stores to franchisees who have experience operating stores in an attempt to improve their performance. In these cases, we have negotiated a call option in order to be able to purchase the stores back after a predetermined period of time and/or pursuant to certain performance criteria. We also regularly pursue franchising opportunities as part of our overall asset-light financial strategy. In addition, we are continually refining our stores’ offering and the overall customer experience within our various stores through the development of new concepts. Stores that are converted to a new 103 ----- concept that has established itself beyond a trial phase tend to outperform other stores under the same banner that have not yet been converted. For a summary of the evolution in the size of our network of stores during the periods under review, see “Business— Management of Real Estate Portfolio”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.6,Customer financing,"We believe that, as a general matter, access to credit finance encourages sales, and as a result, the financing options we are able to offer our customers have an impact on our sales and results of operations. Both Floa Bank (formerly Banque Casino) in France and GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito in Latin America offer customers the ability to pay for their purchases in installments through different finance options. For example, through financial services that Floa Bank offers to consumers, such as its Coup de Pouce consumer finance loans, Cdiscount customers may pay for purchases in four installments or qualify for longer-term loans. We believe this program is a key differentiating factor for Cdiscount. During the year ended December 31, 2020, more than 35% of Cdiscount’s sales and GMV were paid for through four installment payments, with one upfront payment and three subsequent interest-bearing payments 30, 60 and 90 days after the initial payment. Under the agreement implemented in August 2015 between Cdiscount and Floa Bank, Cdiscount fully transfers the credit risk of the installments related to this program in France to Floa Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the costs related to sales of receivables, including under this program, were €38.7 million and were recognized as part of other financial expenses for the Group and thus do not have an impact on EBITDA. Installment sales are also a common feature in Brazil. GPA has been involved in extending credit to Brazilian customers through a partnership with Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A., one of the largest privatelyowned financial institutions in Brazil, called Financeira Itaú CBD S.A. Crédito, Financiamento e Investimento (“FIC”). Following its spin-off from GPA, Assaí received 50% of the shares of Bellamar Empreendimentos e Participações Ltda., a holding company that held 35.76% of the shares of FIC as of December 31, 2020. FIC exclusively offers credit cards, financial services and insurance coverage at GPA’s and Assaí’s Brazilian stores. Part of the strategy of GPA and Assaí in Brazil is to increase the share of FIC’s credit cards and financial services at its stores as an important loyalty tool and mechanism to increase sales and profitability. FIC’s credit cards offer payment options for cardholders at GPA’s and Assaí’s stores, aiming to provide them with benefits and convenience and thereby encourage them to make purchases at such stores. GPA’s Extra hypermarkets offer consumer financing incentives to its customers to purchase home appliances on an installment basis through its FIC cobranded and private label credit cards, as well as thirdparty credit cards. Sales on an installment basis to customers using such credit cards have accounted for an increasing amount of GPA’s sales in Brazil over recent years. In Colombia, Grupo Éxito is party to a partnership with Bancolombia to offer consumer finance and credit cards through a joint venture called Tuya. Tuya cards are the second most widely held credit cards in Colombia, and permit customers to benefit from discounts and withdraw cash advances at Éxito’s stores. Limitations in the availability of consumer credit, high interest rates on such credit or our inability to provide financial services to our customer base, including, in each case, as a result of decreased consumer access to credit in an economic downturn, could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations. 104 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Currency translation risks arise because we report our financial results in euro, but a significant portion of our net sales is recognized in other currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso, the Uruguayan peso and the Argentine peso. Transaction risks arise whenever we enter into a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the functional currency of the transacting entity. Our Group is primarily exposed to transaction risk as a result of purchases of goods in U.S. dollars. Unfavorable changes in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial statements and lead to financial losses. For a discussion of our exchange rate risks, see “—Quantitative and _Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks—Currency Risk”._ We hedge currency transaction risk on highly probable budgeted future purchases (mainly goods purchases billed in U.S. dollars) through forward contracts (or equivalent instruments) relating to the payment currency. In addition, we fully hedge currency risks on debt issuances denominated in a currency other than that of the relevant issuer, except where the debt represents a designated and documented hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation of such issuer. We use standard financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency risks. For a further discussion of our management of currency risk, see note 11.5.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum. During the periods under review we have been impacted by hyperinflation in the Argentine peso. Beginning with our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have applied IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies with limited retrospective application to address this issue in our financial statements. IAS 29 requires that the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies should be (i) restated by applying a general price index so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period and (ii) converted into euros at the period-end exchange-rate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

As a result of these transactions, our results of operations may not be directly comparable from one period to the next. In particular, disposals of stores will have a negative impact on net sales and, other than in the case of lossmaking stores, trading profit and EBITDA, and the gain or loss realized on the sale will be recognized as, 106 ----- and therefore have a one-time impact on, other operating income and expenses from continuing operations and discontinued operations. Sale and leaseback transactions will also have a one-time impact on other operating income, and will, during the life of the relevant leases, increase other financial expenses as a result of the rental payments due to the purchasers of the properties.

After taking into,17.4.1,Changes in Accounting Methods,"The following is a discussion of certain changes in accounting methods that affect the comparability of our results of operations during the periods under review. For a further discussion of changes in accounting methods that have occurred, see note 1.3 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum. _IFRS 16 – Leases_ IFRS 16 (Leases), which the IASB published in January 2016 and which became mandatory for companies reporting according to IFRS from January 1, 2019, eliminates the distinction between operating and finance leases, and requires almost all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Under this new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability, measured as the net present value of future lease payments, are recognized. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted. The new standard affects certain commonly used financial ratios and performance metrics because of its impact on the balance sheet and on the nature of the expenses related to leases, as rent expenses are substantially replaced with depreciation and finance costs. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognize assets corresponding to the right to use the underlying leased asset for the estimated term of the lease, as well as liabilities corresponding to the discounted obligation to make lease payments for substantially all leases. Operating lease expense in the consolidated income statement is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset, 112 ----- presented in cost of goods sold or selling expenses, and interest expense on the financial liability, presented in other financial expenses. The new lease accounting rules under IFRS 16 primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases. Our principal leased assets include our stores and warehouses. Previously, the Group classified most of its leases as operating leases and recognized rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. No asset or liability was previously recognized except to reflect any timing difference between the rental payment period and the period in which the related expense is recognized. We have applied the IFRS 16 standard from its mandatory adoption date of January 1, 2019. In the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we applied the full retrospective transition approach and have restated all comparative information for the year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. For further detail on the impact of our application of IFRS 16 on our financial statements, including a reconciliation from our reported results of operations, cash flow and balance sheet as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the restated figures for such period including IFRS 16 adjustments and other adjustments, see notes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in this Offering Memorandum. Our comparison our results of operations from continuing operations for the years presented herein are on a post-IFRS 16 basis. In December 2019, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published its decision on (i) determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease or a lease that can be terminated by either of the parties with no contractual penalty and (ii) the link between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. This decision provides clarifications that may impact the term of leases other than the particular cases mentioned. In light of this decision, on July 3, 2020, the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables, or the “ANC”) issued a new position statement on July 3, 2020 regarding French commercial leases that are described as “3-6-9” leases, because such leases are signed for at least nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years. This statement superseded the ANC’s previous position statement of February 16, 2018. Subsequent to the issuance of such position statement, we performed a further analysis of our leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected by the ANC’s position statement. As a result of this further analysis, the Group revised its accounting treatment of certain lease contracts to reflect an increased estimated term for the following leases: leases that automatically renew or are terminable at any time; and assets under lease (stores, warehouses), including non-removable leasehold improvements, the residual net carrying amount of which at the end of the estimated lease term pursuant to the IFRS 16 standard may constitute a significant penalty (within the meaning of the decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee) for the Group. The revised accounting treatment of such leases resulted in a changed presentation beginning with our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, which included a restated presentation of the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our discussion in this Offering Memorandum of our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 presents for the comparative period the restated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not, however, restate our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. For a further discussion of this decision, see notes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Offering Memorandum. 113 ----- _Presentation of costs of obtaining contracts_ In 2019, we reviewed the presentation of costs to obtain contracts in our statement of financial position. Costs to obtain contracts, previously included in other current and non-current assets, have been included in other intangible assets in our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. We believe that this voluntary change of presentation improves the quality of our financial disclosures as it reflects the way in which this investment – related to the management of our franchise – is itself managed (i.e., as though we had acquired an intangible asset (the customer relationship)). In our income statement, costs to obtain contracts are now recognized over the term of the contract as an amortization expense within selling expenses and no longer as an expense within cost of goods sold. The amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to €39 million (including the portion relating to Leader Price as a discontinued operation). The reclassification qualifies as a change of method and has therefore been applied retrospectively to 2018 in our audited annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 as if the new presentation had been adopted as of the beginning of those periods. _IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_ IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments explains how to reflect the effects of uncertainty in accounting for current and deferred tax assets and liabilities under IAS 12 – Income taxes. We have applied IFRIC 23 as from January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method (that is, without a restatement of comparative information). The application of this interpretation did not result in any significant changes to the measurement of uncertain tax balances as of December 31, 2018. We also reclassified a number of statement of financial position items from “Provisions for risks and expenses” to “Current tax liabilities” and/or “Deferred taxes”. These changes in presentation did not have a material impact.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

After taking into,17.4.2,,"account €34 million of net liabilities transferred with the stores, proceeds from the disposal could reach €683 million, of which €648 million was received on closing and €35 million was structured as an earn-out contingent on compliance with certain operational indicators during a transition period and which we may receive as such milestones are achieved. The transaction generated a pre-tax disposal loss of €206 million. In addition, we may sell further Leader Price stores in the short term to Aldi France, for up to €11 million. Prior to closing the Leader Price Disposal, during 2020, we repurchased approximately 100 stores held by master franchisees that were sold to Aldi France as part of the Leader Price Disposal. The agreement includes a transition period, running through 2021, during which we will manage the day-to-day operations of the sold stores until they are progressively converted to the Aldi banner. We remain the owner of the Leader Price brand and will continue to operate it in France and internationally, under certain conditions agreed with Aldi. The Group will keep its profitable wholesale activity for 200 Leader Price franchise stores, and external or internal clients (including Franprix, Casino Géant and Casino supermarkets). In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, beginning with our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we have accounted for Leader Price’s results of operations and cash flows in our financial statements as a discontinued operation and our assets related to Leader Price as assets held for sale. Disposal of Vindémia We sold Vindémia to the GBH group on June 30, 2020 as part of our plan to dispose of non-strategic assets. The sale price for Vindémia totaled €207 million (with an enterprise value of €219 million) and was based on net debt and working capital as estimated at the date of the sale. The payment collected on the sale amounted to €186 million as of June 30, 2020, generating a disposal loss of €23 million, including a loss of €13 million on reclassifying foreign currency translation adjustments within gains and losses on disposals. 107 ----- If the transaction had been completed on January 1, 2020, the sale would have had a negative €405 million impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales, a negative €22 million impact on trading profit and a negative €9 million impact on net profit. _Year ended December 31, 2019_ Disposal of Via Varejo On November 23, 2016, we announced that we had approved GPA’s decision to start negotiations for the sale of its investment in its subsidiary Via Varejo, the largest non-food retailer in Brazil, in line with its long-term strategic refocusing on the food retailing business. This sale was completed on June 14, 2019 through a block sale on the market of shares in Via Varejo at a price of BRL 4.90 per share, representing a total sale price of BRL 2.3 billion (€517 million). In accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, beginning with our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 and through the date on which the sale was completed, we accounted for Via Varejo’s results of operations in our financial statements as a discontinued operation and our assets related to Via Varejo as assets held for sale. Taking into account the two total return swaps (“TRSs”) entered into during the first half of 2019 with respect to certain of GPA’s shares in Via Varejo, total proceeds received from the sale of the stake in Via Varejo amounted to BRL 2.7 billion (€615 million). These transactions led to the recognition of a capital gain after tax of BRL 21 million (€6 million), which we accounted for as net profit from discontinued operations. The sale decreased non-controlling interests by €742 million. Sale and leaseback transactions We entered into two sale and leaseback transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019, which generated a capital loss before tax of €25 million. - On March 8, 2019, we sold 26 store properties (13 Géant Casino supermarkets, three Hyper Casino hypermarkets and 10 Casino Supermarkets) to funds managed by Fortress for a sale price of €392 million. The transaction included a variable component of up to an additional €120 million depending mainly on the future yield on the properties sold, paid out as such milestones are achieved. We will continue to operate the stores under leases representing an annual rent of €32 million. - On October 15, 2019, we sold 31 store properties (12 Géant Casino supermarkets and 19 Monoprix stores and Casino supermarkets) valued at €465 million to funds managed by companies affiliated with Apollo Global Management. The consideration totaled €327 million and includes a variable component of up to an additional €120 million, to be paid out as certain milestones are achieved. We will continue to operate these 31 stores under leases representing an annual rent of €27 million. Store disposals and closures during the period In 2019, agreements were signed to sell 31 integrated stores (including 17 hypermarkets) for a combined consideration of €281 million; as of December 31, 2019, the Group had completed the sale of 28 stores (including 15 hypermarkets) and received consideration of €165 million. In addition, 36 loss-making integrated stores were closed during the year ended December 31, 2019. Together, these stores represented net sales of around €483 million and a trading loss of €39 million during the year ended December 31, 108 ----- 2018. The gain in trading profit on these stores on a full-year basis including the associated structural costs is estimated to be approximately €50 million. _Year ended December 31, 2018_ Sale of a stake in Mercialys On July 26, 2018, in connection with our Asset Disposal Plan, we reduced our stake in Mercialys from 40.3% of the voting and economic rights to 25.3%, through a block sale of shares representing 15% of the share capital of Mercialys to a bank under a TRS. We received immediate proceeds from the sale amounting to €213 million. Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank. Consequently the shares were not derecognized from our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and a liability was recorded for €198 million, corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market. The income statement impact of the bank’s sale during 2018 of 1% of the share capital was not material. As of December 31, 2018, the consolidated financial statements included the Group’s 39.2% equity in Mercialys, of which 14 percentage points corresponded to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank. The shares under the TRS were reclassified as assets held for sale, in accordance with IFRS 5, in an amount of €114 million (representing the book value of the shares held under the TRS). As of December 31, 2019, 64.6% of the shares held under the TRS had been sold. A corresponding capital loss of €20 million was recorded under other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the liability corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market amounted to €102 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the consolidated financial statements included our 30.6% interest in Mercialys on an equity-accounted basis, of which 5.3 percentage points corresponded to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank. On August 21, 2020, we announced an additional and definitive disposal of 5% of Mercialys equity through the TRS. We received immediate proceeds from the sale amounting to €26 million. This amount was allocated to the escrow account dedicated to the reimbursement of our gross debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of the shares subject to the Mercialys TRS had been sold on the market. As a result, as of such date, we held 20.3% of the voting and economic rights in Mercialys, which were accounted for using the equity method. A loss of €72 million was recognized in other operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to the unwinding of the Mercialys TRS. In all, the Group had a cash outflow of €47 million in 2020 in respect of the Mercialys TRS, net of the €26 million collected from the 5% stake transferred. Property development operations with Mercialys are neutralized in EBITDA consistently with the Group’s percentage interest in Mercialys. A reduction in the Group’s stake in Mercialys or the disposal of related assets by Mercialys therefore results in the recognition of EBITDA that was previously neutralized. Over the year ended December 31, 2020, deneutralized EBITDA in relation to the reduction of our stake in Mercialys represented €45 million. 109 ----- Acquisition of Sarenza On April 30, 2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, a leading online personal goods and fashion retailer. The price paid for 100% of the shares was €22 million. Sarenza’s contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from April 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was €97 million. Sarenza’s net sales from January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018 were €43 million. Sarenza’s contribution to our pre-tax profit for the period was not material. The purchase price allocation led to the recognition of a trademark amounting to €6 million and goodwill of €16 million (corresponding to the difference between the book value of the acquired net assets and the consideration transferred) as of December 31, 2019. Sale and leaseback transactions On December 20, 2018, the Group sold buildings pertaining to 53 Monoprix stores to Generali Group and 14 Monoprix stores to AG2R La Mondiale. After deducting registration fees, the proceeds from this transaction amounted to €742 million (before transaction costs) and generated a capital gain of €166 million, net of transaction costs. The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing an annual rent of €35 million. Store disposals during the period On February 28, 2018, Franprix-Leader Price sold control of 105 Franprix and Leader Price stores to a master franchisee. The sale proceeds amounted to €33 million. If the transactions had been completed on January 1, 2018, the additional impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales, trading profit and net profit would not have been material. Franprix-Leader Price retained a 49% interest in the group of stores and has a call option to repurchase the group, which is exercisable between 2021 and 2023. The same master franchisee acquired a 40% stake in another group of Franprix-Leader Price stores. The master franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake and Franprix-Leader Price has a call option on such stake. During the first half of 2018, Distribution Casino France (“DCF”) sold a 40% stake in five Casino supermarkets to a master franchisee, retaining control of the supermarkets. The master franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake and Distribution Casino France has a call option. Store acquisitions during the period Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of 126 stores during 2018, at a total cost of €79 million. Certain of the stores acquired were previously accounted for by the equity method in our consolidated financial statements. The previously-held interest was therefore remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €22 million gain in “Other operating income”. If the acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2018, the additional impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales, trading profit and net profit would not have been material. _Organic Growth and Same-Store Growth_ To adjust for changes in consolidation scope and for changes in the number of stores in our network, we present organic growth in net sales and trading profit and same-store growth in net sales in this Offering Memorandum. 110 ----- Organic Growth Organic growth in net sales corresponds to consolidated net sales at constant scope of consolidation and constant foreign exchange rates, excluding Calendar Effects and excluding net sales from fuel, because fuel sales is an ancillary activity for our stores that is subject to a high volatility in price and demand depending on crude oil prices. For each of a given period N and its prior-year comparative period N-1, the base figures for organic growth in net sales are computed on a monthly basis as follows: - total net sales; - minus net sales of fuel; - minus net sales generated by: `o` companies acquired and thus brought into our consolidation scope after the first day of period N-1; and `o` companies sold and thus that were removed from our consolidation scope before the last day of period N. The base figure for a given period N thus derived is divided by the base figure for its prior-year comparative period N-1 thus derived to arrive at a percentage change, from which the percentage change due to Calendar Effects is subtracted. The variation of organic net sales from one period to another is computed on a constant exchange rate basis, applying the exchange rate applicable to period N-1 to period N. Transactions that involve a significant part of our network and are communicated to the market are treated as a change in consolidation scope and are therefore also adjusted for as a part of the calculation of organic growth (for example, disposals of hypermarkets in connection with the Rocade Plan). Management determines which such transactions are sufficiently significant to be included as an adjustment in the calculation of organic growth and, in making such determination, it is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts presented in this Offering Memorandum that incorporate Calendar Effects. For organic growth figures presented by banner, no adjustments are made to account for stores that operated under a particular banner in period N and under a different banner in its comparative period N-1. Organic growth in trading profit is calculated on the same basis as described above, except that it does not exclude Calendar Effects or fuel sales. Same-Store Growth We show growth in net sales on a same-store basis in order to measure a like-for-like evolution between a given period N and its prior-year comparative period N-1, excluding non-recurring effects, foreign exchange effects and Calendar Effects. It measures the performance of our commercial concepts, while excluding the impact of certain external factors or significant changes affecting our operations. 111 ----- For each month within the periods under review, same-store net sales are computed as follows: - organic net sales for the period (calculated as described above); - _minus_ net sales attributable to wholesale sales made to our franchisees by our central purchasing agency, which we consider as subject to volatility due to changes in franchisees’ purchase policies (including decisions on whether to source products through us or directly from third-party suppliers and changes in inventory levels); - _minus net sales generated by: `o` stores which opened or were acquired and thus brought into our consolidation scope after the first day of the month in period N-1 (but only to the extent net sales from such stores have not already been excluded in the calculation of organic growth for the relevant month); and `o` stores which were sold or closed and thus were removed from our consolidation scope before the last day of the month in period N (but only to the extent net sales from such stores have not already been excluded in the calculation of organic growth for the relevant month); - _minus net sales generated by stores whose operations were affected by non-recurring events with a significant impact on sales performance, including the effect of renovation works in a store causing a full or partial store closure, public works causing a significant disturbance in access to or visibility of the store and damage resulting from acts of god or civil disorder. Same-store net sales are computed at constant exchange rates (as described above) and, because they are calculated from organic net sales for the period, they include the related adjustments for Calendar Effects and fuel sales.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

For more information, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum. _Net sales include sales by our stores and sales to our franchisees through our central purchasing_ agency (to the extent such franchises are not already consolidated in our financial statements), service stations, e-commerce sites and restaurants, franchise fees, revenues from business leases and financial services revenues. _Other revenue consists of revenue from our property development and property trading businesses,_ rental revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and revenues from our energy business. _Cost of goods sold comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees_ and any tax credits associated with purchases, changes in retail inventories and logistics costs. It also includes costs to fulfill contracts, property development and property trading business costs and changes in related inventories (which had previously been included in selling expenses). 114 ----- _Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are comprised of two components:_ Selling expenses_ consist of point-of-sale costs and the amortization of the incremental costs of obtaining contracts. Selling expenses also included property development and property trading business costs and changes in related inventories. General and administrative expenses_ correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including the purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions. _Depreciation and amortization expense is included in SG&A to the extent that the relevant asset_ relates to SG&A activities. We also recognize depreciation and amortization expense on our inventory in cost of goods sold. _EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is defined as trading_ profit plus recurring depreciation and amortization expenses included in trading profit (but excluding impairment of inventories and trade receivables, other receivables and provisions for litigation and risks included in trading profit). For the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, which are presented on a post-IFRS 16 basis, EBITDA does not include lease expenses except for variable lease expenses and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Trading profit_ is defined as operating profit before other operating income and other operating expenses. For the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, which are presented on a post-IFRS 16 basis, trading profit does not include lease payments except for variable lease expenses, leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and depreciation of the right-of-use asset. _Other operating income and other operating expenses include (i) certain items which, by definition,_ are not included in an assessment of a business unit’s recurring operating performance, such as gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, impairment losses on non-current assets, and income/expenses related to changes in the scope of consolidation (for example, transaction costs and fees for acquisitions of control, gains and losses from disposals of subsidiaries, remeasurement at fair value of previously-held interests) and (ii) certain non-recurring items that would distort analyses of the Group’s recurring profitability. They are defined as significant items of income and expense that are limited in number, unusual or abnormal, whose occurrence is rare. Examples include restructuring costs (such as reorganization costs and the costs of converting stores to new concepts) and provisions and expenses for litigation and risks (including discounting adjustments). Although we recognize restructuring charges in each period due to the evolution of our store network, we consider these costs to fall outside of our recurring operating performance due to their nature. In addition, certain non-recurring items may be included in net sales or other revenues. _Income from cash and cash equivalents includes income on cash and cash equivalents and gains or_ losses on disposals of cash equivalents. _Finance costs comprise interest expense on financial liabilities, gains and losses on interest rate_ hedges (including the ineffective portion) and related currency effects. Finance costs also include changes in the fair value of hedging derivative instruments. _Other financial income and other financial expenses comprise financial income and expenses that_ are not included in net finance costs, including, among others, dividends received from non-consolidated companies, non-recourse factoring and associated transaction costs, discounting adjustments (including to provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations), gains and losses arising from 115 ----- remeasurement at fair value of equity derivatives, impairment losses, realized gains and losses on financial assets other than cash and cash equivalents and the interest cost related to the lease liability generated by the application of the IFRS 16 standard. Exchange gains and losses are also recorded under this caption, apart from (i) exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities, which are presented under net finance costs, and (ii) the effective portion of accounting hedges of operating transactions, which are included in trading profit. _Income tax consists of current and deferred taxes calculated in accordance with the relevant tax_ laws in force in the jurisdictions in which we operate. _Share of profit of equity-accounted investees includes the Group’s share of the result of companies_ accounted for by the equity method. Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to owners of the parent_ represents the Group’s economic interest in the total reported profit/(loss) from continuing operations. As we consolidate a number of activities that are not wholly owned (for example, we currently have a 41.2% interest in each of GPA and Assaí), there can be considerable differences between net profit/(loss) from continuing operations and net profit/(loss) from continuing operations, attributable to owners of the parent, and, depending on the relative performance of our different segments, these items can even be directionally opposite.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The IMF ranked France as the 7[th] largest economy globally, and 3rd largest in Europe. The French economy grew by 1.5% in real terms in each of 2018 and 2019 and is estimated to have decreased by 9.0% in 2020 (Source: IMF) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The French economy is projected to grow at a compound average growth rate (“CAGR”) of 2.8% between 2020 and 2025 (Source: IMF). Due to ECB policy, inflation is relatively low in France, reaching 1.3% in 2019. Inflation is estimated to have been 0.5% in 2020, with a projected CAGR of 1.2% between 2020 and 2025 (Source: IMF). France is one of the most populous countries in Europe, currently ranking only behind Russia, Germany and the United Kingdom. In 2020, the population of France was estimated to amount to 65.0 million people (Source: IMF). The French population is expected to reach 65.9 million people by 2025, which implies a CAGR of 0.3% between 2020 and 2025 (Source: IMF). 81% of the French population lives in cities (Source: World Bank), with around 18% of the total population living in the Paris area as of 143 ----- January 1, 2020 (Source: Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques, “INSEE”). France’s economic growth is largely driven by three regions: Île-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and ProvenceAlpes-Côte d’Azur. These regions each have favorable trends such as tourism, favorable demographics and high living standards. These three regions have a cumulative population of 25.4 million people (39% of the total French population), but generate 49% of France’s GDP according to the latest data available for 2019 (Source: INSEE). The French unemployment rate was 8.5% in 2019, is estimated to have increased to 8.9% in 2020 and is expected to rise even further to 10.2% in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Source: _IMF)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In France, food expenses accounted for 11.9% of the aggregate consumer spending in 2019. This is relatively high compared to other European countries (e.g., 11.5% for Spain, 9.6% for Germany, 7.1% for the United Kingdom and slightly below the 13.1% of Italy (Source: Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, “OECD”). **‘14—19 2014** **2015** **2016** **2017** **2018** **2019** **CAGR** Food spending (€ million) ....... 140,140 141,841 144,659 146,353 148,355 151,201 1.5% _Source: OECD_ In comparison, in 2019, Italy’s food spending amounted to €142,512 million, €84,747 million for Spain, €165,206 million for Germany and €95,216 million for the United Kingdom, according to the OECD. Between 2015 and 2020, grocery retail sales in France grew at CAGR of 1.0%, according to Euromonitor. The French retailing market is gradually evolving, driven by changing consumer lifestyles and socio-demographic trends, such as an ageing population, smaller families, growing individualization of lifestyles, digitalization as well as increasing urbanization. These trends have led to a transition in grocery retail from mass market to more tailored offers, which has resulted in a greater diversity of retail formats and concepts, a broader and more segmented product offering, as well as more individualized contact with consumers. This trend has resulted in a strong performance of convenience-led formats. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related restrictions on parts of the economy have resulted in a shift in the retailing landscape, benefiting grocery retail in particular. Since grocery retail stores are considered essential shops, they were allowed to remain open and hence benefited from a shift in demand from out-of-home to in-home consumption. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the evolution of the French retailing market, with the transition in grocery retail from mass-market to more tailored offers and the trend of evolving retail formats, such as the ongoing outperformance of convenience-led formats and grocery retail e-commerce as compared with the underperformance of the hypermarket channel. The increased penetration of e-commerce is expected to continue in the medium and longer term, with a much higher number of people joining the pool of online consumers. The grocery retail market is rapidly evolving on the technological front. Store-based grocery retailers are signing new partnerships or acquiring digital players to adapt to consumer demand. With the spread of internet usage, retailers are developing internet-linked solutions to meet consumer demand and pure-play online retailers are acquiring physical spaces. The convergence of pure players and bricks-andclicks retailers is expected to lead to the further development of web-to-store concepts, notably “phygital” stores, hybrid connected bricks-and-clicks shops, which enable consumers to order on big screens. 144 ----- To maintain or increase market shares, grocery retailers are expected to focus on their e-commerce operations, at-home delivery services, omni-channel product offering and lengthening opening schedules as well as improvements to product differentiation and price competition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,France,18.1.3,Grocery Retail – Overview of Key Formats from Euromonitor,"_Modern grocery retailing is the aggregation of the grocery channels that have emerged alongside_ the growth of chain retail. It is the aggregation of five channels: Hypermarkets, Supermarkets, Discounters, Forecourt Retailers and Convenience Stores. _Traditional grocery retailing is the aggregation of channels that are not affiliated with large chain_ retailers and are, therefore, owned by families and/or run on an individual basis. It is the aggregation of three channels: Independent Small Grocers, Food/Drink/Tobacco Specialists and Other Grocery Retailers. In 2020, 78.4% of French grocery retail sales were accounted for by modern grocery retailing as opposed to traditional grocery retailing, which compares to 87.4% for Germany, 80.6% for Spain and 89.7% for the United Kingdom. The share of modern grocery has decreased at an average rate of 0.4 percentage points per annum during the last 5 years in France. (Source: Euromonitor International Limited, Retailing _2021 Edition)._ The Hypermarket channel is on the decline in France, with a decline in RSV of (0.9%) per year between 2015-20 (Source: Euromonitor _International Limited, Retailing 2021 Edition, based on retail sales _value measured by retail selling price excluding sales tax, 2020 constant value terms). Several players have_ decreased or have announced their intention to decrease the area contribution of their hypermarket operations (e.g., the Group reduced its hypermarkets sales area from 916,000 square meters in 2016 to 848,000 square meters in 2018 and sold or closed 17 hypermarkets in 2019 and 2020. Carrefour announced in its 2020 results presentation the suspension of its target of 350,000 square meters sales area reduction worldwide by 2022 – while having already reduced its sales area by 145,000 square meters) (Source: _Company press release and investor presentation)._ In the meantime, organic product specialist retailers, driven by a premium development trend, are supporting high growth in the grocery retail market, and have recorded robust growth on the back of consumer preference for organic products. Organic products’ healthy sales and high margins have encouraged modern grocery retailers to develop their own organic corners and private label lines. This has led major players to buy smaller organic specialist retailers (e.g., Les Mousquetaire’s acquisition of a minority share in Les Comptoirs de la Bio, Naturalia’s development for the Group, and Carrefour’s acquisition of So’Bio and Bio c’Bon). Such deals are a way to attract additional consumers with differentiated and more engaging products. As more and more people live in urban areas, format diversification is required to reach urban consumers not interested in hypermarkets on the edge of towns. In order to benefit from urbanization and concentration of high-income households around cities, grocery retailers have developed their convenience and proximity formats to cater to consumers’ demands for convenience and accessibility, as well as premium and tailored offerings. The convenience format has proven to be highly attractive and carries on attracting more consumers that are less sensitive to price. 145 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Preliminary Euromonitor data projects that_ Food and Drink e-commerce will grow at a CAGR of 5.6% between 2020 and 2025, compared to 0.3% for store-based Grocery Retailers. The grocery e-commerce segment remains anchored around existing major grocery retail players as it has grown through the development of drive-in formats (e.g., Leclerc Drive, Carrefour Drive) and click-and-collect stores with dedicated areas with vehicle runways and collection points, mostly close to hypermarkets. The segment has also grown through grocery delivery partnerships (e.g., the partnership between Amazon and the Group) mostly developed for proximity and convenience stores. The grocery ecommerce segment experienced high growth in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns in France (in March-April and in November). According to Fevad, during 2020, 1.84 billion online sales transactions were recorded for a total turnover of €112 billion, and the number of marketplaces have increased by 17,400 in one year. Online marketplaces have gained considerable share in the e-commerce competitive landscape. This is driven by retail sales value remaining concentrated around a few websites with the widest reach and largest sales. This phenomenon is accentuated by emergence of international marketplaces which can mutualize costs thanks to high volume traded, and offer competitive prices while keeping margins constant. In addition to Amazon, some players like Cdiscount, Veepee and eBay have successfully established marketplace operations. The e-commerce activity remains concentrated among these larger players: 90% of e-commerce turnover is generated by 5.5% of merchant sites (10,000 sites) _(Source: Fevad iCE).

The key drivers of the energy transition, which in turn drives GreenYellow’s business model, are the following: a rapidly increasing share of decarbonized energy sources, strong regulatory incentives for renewables and energy savings, a shift from centralized to decentralized energy production units and customers’ willingness to reduce their energy bills whilst limiting capex, therefore benefitting energy efficiency agreements (“EEAs”). There are three main cost reduction drivers for renewable power, with respect to which GreenYellow aims to be well positioned: economies of scale and competitive procurement, technology improvements, and a mature client base. In the alternative/photovoltaic energy market, the market shares of alternative energy suppliers have grown steadily since the end of the EDF monopoly in 2007. In France, the total giga watt (“GW”) photovoltaic (“PV”) installed capacity grew at a CAGR of 13% over 2012-2017, and should grow at a CAGR of 11% over 2017-2035, faster than all other energy sources (Source: Boston Consulting Group). In terms of energy efficiency, France is engaged in an energy efficiency plan, aiming at reducing its final energy consumption to 131.4 million-ton equivalent of petroleum (“Mtep”), and to 219.9 Mtep for primary energy (art. 3 of Directive 2012/27/EU) (Source: Rapport de la Direction Générale de l’Energie _et du Climat – Service du Climat et de l’Efficacité Energétique). France has set the objective to increase its_ energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, in line with other European countries (Source: European Commission). France’s PV capacity additions are expected to amount to 1.3 GW in 2020, the highest level since 2012. This 50% growth compared with 2019 results from the commissioning of projects from auctions held during 2017-2018 for large buildings and ground-mounted installations. In April 2020, the government published its new multiannual energy plan (the “PPE”), which confirms its commitment to 20 GW of PV capacity by 2023, as well as annual auctions for 2 GW of ground-mounted projects and 0.9 GW of large rooftop installations by 2024. Emerging countries have also seen their solar PV net capacity increase over recent years, and it is expected to keep growing. Brazilian solar PV additions in 2020 are expected to have increased by over 30% compared to 2019, with distributed installations expanding the most – by a record amount of more than 2 GW– due to continuation of the generous net metering program.

Brazil’s economy suffered a severe political and economic crisis in mid-2014 that only ended in 2016. During that period, Brazil fell into recession for two years, hit by the fall in commodity prices and demand (driven by a slowdown of the Chinese economy) and an internal political crisis that has undermined investor confidence.

Cash & carry is a strong format in Brazil, catering not only to smaller retailers, small consumer foodservice players and other businesses, but also individual consumers. The channel has benefited from rising consumer price sensitivity as a result of past volatility in consumer purchasing power in the country, with Brazilians increasingly prioritizing price over convenience. 149 ----- Informal retailing is also widely popular in Brazil.

In 2018 and 2019, retailing in Colombia exhibited a positive outlook in terms of consumption, resulting from tax changes, rising prices, and adjustments in households that changed consumers’ purchasing behavior, allowing them to regain confidence in acquiring a greater number of durable goods. Combined with the strengthening of the relation to price, quality and benefits in their shopping experiences, the downward trend present in 2017 appears to have dissipated. Consumers can easily access retailers in Colombia when they are located near their homes or workplaces, which is true especially for grocery retailers. For non-grocery specialists, consumers commonly visit shopping centers, which are perceived to offer greater safety when shopping. Malls are also redefining their concept towards family entertainment where people can shop, eat and spend leisure time. To adapt to consumers’ needs and habits, retailers are now partnering with third-party services such as delivery services (Rappi, Domicilios.com and Merqueo) to be closer to their customers. 151 ----- The arrival of discounters in Colombia has decreased the popularity of convenience stores, which are seen as more expensive but with more limited offerings.

However, traditional grocery retailers, which at this point in time still account for the largest value share amongst grocery retailers, remain reluctant to venture into internet retailing, as the majority of them are small businesses, without the capacity to invest in mobile apps. The largest grocery manufacturers and importers have their own distribution networks, whilst smaller ones usually operate through wholesalers with countrywide coverage that reaches small grocery retailers and foodservice outlets with their sales forces.

The IMF ranked Argentina as the third largest economy in South America. The economy fell into_ recession in 2018. The strong peso depreciation around mid-2018 severely fueled inflation (with 34.3% 153 ----- inflation in 2018 and 53.5% inflation in 2019 according to the IMF), reducing disposable income and investor confidence. Argentina is currently running out of hard currency while grappling with high inflation and economic contraction. IMF stepped in to assist Argentina with a $44 billion funding arrangement. On September 1, 2019, Argentina imposed currency controls in an attempt to stabilize markets. As a result, firms had to seek central bank permission to sell pesos to buy foreign currency and to make transfers abroad, which impacted foreign trade. Consumers had to seek permission from the central bank to purchase more than $10,000 in goods a month. These measures applied until the end of 2019. In 2020, difficulties increased for Argentina in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, Argentina reached a debtrestructuring deal with private creditors to end its default, under which the country has pushed debt amortizations to 2025 and beyond and reduced interest payments. In 2020, the population of Argentina amounted to 45.4 million people (Source: IMF). The Argentinian population is expected to reach 47.7 million by 2025, which implies a 1.0% CAGR between 2020 and 2025 (Source: IMF). 92% of the country’s population live in cities (Source: World Bank).

We offer both brand-name and private label food and consumer products through traditional retail stores as well as e-commerce food and non-food websites and apps. We also provide business-to-business and business-to-consumer services through our portfolio of complementary lines of business. Our retail banners operate under formats which aim to adapt to current consumer trends and needs across the various geographies in which we operate. Our premium retail format offers many innovative services and a high-quality shopping experience. Our convenience retail format is adapted to both city centers and rural areas, offering everyday basics to meet the expectations of customers seeking quality, authenticity and service. Our hypermarket, cash & carry and discount retail formats offer a wide range of quality products at affordable prices. We believe most of our banners enjoy leading market positions in most of our markets. We have a strong focus on innovation and have developed an omni-channel offering that we believe has favorably positioned us to respond to evolving consumer trends. We have developed partnerships with leading innovators such as Amazon and Ocado in order to provide best-in-class digital offer and grocery delivery services in France, as well as with Uber Eats and Deliveroo. We also offer customers in France hundreds of stores with autonomous solutions that provide a convenient and seamless retail experience, allowing customers to shop in the evening or on Sunday without the need to go through a physical checkout. Our pure-play e-commerce platform, Cdiscount, is the second largest non-food e-tailer in France by UMV and has allowed us to offer a range of adjacent business-to-consumer and business-to-business services. In France, Brazil and Colombia, our brick-and-mortar retail banners benefit from mobile applications and other e-commerce functionality that allow us to provide targeted promotions to our customers and give our customers the flexibility to shop how they want, when they want. We have developed a number of other complementary business lines that allow us to use our knowhow while monetizing our asset base. Through our subsidiary, GreenYellow, we have become a leader in photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency with a diverse customer portfolio and an expanding platform of innovative energy solutions. In addition, these businesses also include real estate development and shopping center management, consumer finance and, in France specifically, digital advertising and data center solutions via relevanC and ScaleMax, respectively. We operate primarily in France and, through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, in Latin America, although through Cdiscount and a number of international affiliates, we provide products and services to customers in other international markets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated €31,912 million in net sales and €2,742 million in EBITDA and our France Retail and E-commerce segments recorded net sales of €17,256 million and EBITDA of €1,580 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,History,18.20.1,,"Our origins date back to 1898, when Geoffroy Guichard created Société des Magasins du Casino and opened the first store in Veauche, in central France. In 1901, we created France’s first private label. 155 ----- Our network quickly expanded in the Saint-Étienne region, around Clermont-Ferrand and on the Côte d’Azur. By 1939, we managed nine warehouses, 20 production plants and 2,500 retail outlets. From the 1950s onwards, we began to diversify our formats and activities. We successively opened our first self-service store, our first Casino supermarket and our first Géant hypermarket before creating the Casino cafeterias. Starting in the 1980s, in response to an increasingly competitive retail environment, we began to strengthen our operations in France and refocus on our core business as a retailer. Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri became our majority shareholder in 1991. In 1992, we acquired Rallye’s hypermarket, supermarket and cafeteria retail activities. In 1997, we acquired a stake in Monoprix-Prisunic and took control of the Franprix-Leader Price banners. As the year 2000 approached, we were one of France’s leading retailers and were poised to expand our international operations. Between 1998 and 2002, we acquired a number of retailers based in Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Notably, in 1999, we acquired minority stakes in the Colombian Grupo Éxito and Brazilian GPA companies. In France, we consolidated our positioning in convenience and discount formats. In 2000, we acquired a stake in Cdiscount, an online retailer. We simultaneously developed complementary businesses with the creation of Floa Bank (previously Banque Casino) in 2001. In 2005, Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri became our Chief Executive Officer. That same year, our shopping center properties in France were spun off through the creation and initial public offering of the Mercialys property company, in which we continue to hold 20.3% of the voting rights today. Over the following decade, we decided to refocus our portfolio of international operations and concentrate our development efforts on markets where we were poised to hold leading positions. With this strategy in mind, we strengthened our positions in France and Latin America by becoming the majority shareholder of Grupo Éxito in 2007 and of GPA in 2012 and by gaining exclusive control of the Monoprix group in 2013. At the same time, we disposed of certain activities, such as through the sales of our operations in the Netherlands, Poland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam. In France, we are consolidating our position in leading formats and entering into partnerships with key players in our field to strengthen our omni-channel strategy, particularly in the food segment. For example, beginning in 2017 and 2018, we formed partnerships with Ocado and Amazon, respectively, for next-day and same-day express delivery. In 2018, Monoprix acquired online fashion and personal goods retailer Sarenza in order to expand our e-commerce channel. Further, in 2018, we partnered with the Auchan Retail, Metro and Schiever groups to create Horizon International Services, a purchasing alliance covering 47 countries, which aims to move away from purely transactional negotiations with suppliers toward a more collaborative, balanced and innovative approach. In parallel, we have developed new business lines that leverage our operational expertise and monetize our asset base. For example, in 2007, we founded GreenYellow, a solar power generation and energy efficiency company. GreenYellow has since grown into a leader in the provision of solar energy to small and medium enterprises in France, as well as to industrial and international customers. In 2018, we further expanded GreenYellow’s operational flexibility by selling a minority stake in the company to Bpifrance and Tikehau Capital. As we continue to reinforce our positioning in key markets and formats and to evaluate our asset portfolio, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer serve our objectives. Beginning in 2018, following successive reviews of our business portfolio, we have undertaken the Asset Disposal Plan, pursuant to which we have set a cumulative goal of €4.5 billion in 156 ----- disposals. Such disposals support our strategy of increasing our exposure to better-performing formats (such as, _e.g., e-commerce and premium and convenience stores) and demographically favorable regions in France (such as, e.g., the Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur regions). Disposals under this plan have so far amounted to an aggregate of €2.8 billion including, among others, the sale of 20% of the share capital of Mercialys through two equity swaps for €213 million and €26 million, respectively (following which we continue to hold 20.3% of the voting and economic rights of Mercialys), the €150 million GreenYellow capital increase subscribed by Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance, the sale of our subsidiary Vindémia for €186 million, the sale and leaseback of Monoprix real estate assets for €742 million and the sale to Aldi France of three warehouses, two Casino Supermarkets and 545 stores in the Leader Price perimeter for an enterprise value of €717 million (including a €35 million earn-out), resulting in €648 million of proceeds, that closed on November 30, 2020, and approximately €100 million of proceeds from the disposal of other real estate assets. We have also entered into sale and leaseback transactions with funds managed by Fortress Investment Group and Apollo Global Management for certain groups of our stores. We regularly evaluate opportunities for, and may engage in, significant disposals in the future in addition to the Asset Disposal Plan. We have the objective of further developing our unique positioning in our most promising formats and geographical areas by expanding the number of stores in those formats, in particular, our convenience and premium formats. We opened 169 premium and convenience stores in 2020, and we target 300 new store openings in the first half of 2021 (representing an acceleration and expansion of our previously stated goal of 300 new store openings for 2020 and 2021 cumulatively). With this same goal in mind, we are also expanding our e-commerce and Cdiscount operations by capitalizing on the commercial momentum of these online operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on customer shopping patterns. We also aim to reduce our gross debt and our leverage in France. In addition to the Asset Disposal Plan, we also have the objectives of improving our generation of free cash flow before interest and dividends in France by implementing action plans to reduce our inventories and, as a result, improve our working capital and keep our capital expenditures under strict control. Through our successful refinancing initiatives in November 2019 and December 2020, we have further strengthened our financial structure by extending our average debt maturity. Beyond retail and e-commerce, we also intend to accelerate the growth of our complementary business lines, including our energy and data businesses. Finally, GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito also continue to focus on their strategic priorities for 2021, including through the pursuit of the profitable expansion of Assaí stores, operational excellence and profitability at Multivarejo stores and the development of omni-channel and other differentiating formats under the Grupo Éxito umbrella.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

As of December 31, 2020, we had a network of 7,634 stores in France within a diversified_ portfolio of complementary banners, each with different strategies to meet changing consumer expectations. Our portfolio of banners in France is particularly focused on convenience and premium formats, which accounted for 54.6% of our net France Retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and address growing demand from French consumers. Approximately 69% of our France Retail net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated in three of the fastest growing regions of France – the Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes and ProvenceAlpes-Côte d’Azur regions – whose combined population accounted for 39% of the total French population and approximately 49% of France’s GDP growth according to the latest data available for 2019. As of the end of 2020, we had more than 1,300 stores in the Paris area, whose population accounted for roughly 19% of the French population as of December 31, 2020. The map below shows the percentage of our France Retail net sales generated by each of these key regions as of December 31, 2020. 158 ----- In addition, we are the major French food retailer with the smallest exposure to the declining hypermarket format, which accounted for 25% of our France Retail net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Finally, we offer a large range of organic and free of pesticide products and intend to further use our specialized Naturalia stores to develop broad organic offerings across all of our banners. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we had approximately €1.3 billion in net sales from organic products, up from approximately €1.1 billion in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020, our organic sales represented 9.5% of our total France Retail net sales, reflecting growth of 12% compared to the prior year.

Casino banners classified as supermarkets by Euromonitor international include Monoprix, Franprix and Casino supermarkets. (7) “Convenience store & other” forecast growth refers to Euromonitor’s forecast growth for the Convenience category only. We believe that the French food retail market is characterized by a number of demographic characteristics that are favorable for food retailers like our Group. These trends include a growing and aging French population, as well as increasing urbanization favoring retailers that have a highly concentrated network of stores in towns and cities. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly leaning toward high-quality, organic goods, leading to a stronger emphasis on the premium end of the market, in particular in dynamic regions. We believe this is favorable for retailers like us, with a diverse range of banners and an already strong position in sales of organic products. Growth in the French food retail market is moderate, but marked by a strong polarization of format performance, with convenience store net sales expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2020 and 2025, supermarket net sales expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.0% and hypermarket net sales (Source: _Euromonitor, based on retail sales value measured by retail selling price excluding sales tax, 2020 constant value terms) expected to decline by a CAGR of 1.2% between 2020 and 2025. In light of our strong focus_ on the convenience and premium formats and our low exposure to the hypermarket format, which has 160 ----- further been reduced in recent years, we expect to benefit from the trends favoring supermarkets and convenience formats when compared with our main competitors. We are currently focusing on business growth in our convenience formats in urban areas (including Franprix and Naturalia) and semi-urban and rural areas (including Spar, Vival and Casino Shop), with 100 store openings targeted in the first quarter of 2021 and 200 in the second quarter of 2021. We are also pursuing the development of non-food corners, particularly through our partnerships offering Hema, Cdiscount and Decathlon products in Franprix stores, which have been integrated into 210, 66 and 22 stores, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. We have further enhanced our brick and mortar French food retail operations with a number of digital initiatives. For example, each of our principal French retail banners has a mobile application enabling customers to do their shopping or monitor their loyalty card online. Furthermore, we have implemented a number of digital solutions to enhance our customers’ shopping experience, such as integrating mobile payments, digital receipts and scan-and-go solutions through the Monoprix and Casino Max mobile apps. Purchases by Casino Max app holders accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales in hypermarkets and supermarkets in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our banners’ apps also allow individual marketing capabilities, with personalized, targeted coupons and discounts, which we believe is a key distinguishing factor from most of our competitors. Innovation is also central to the development of our Casino Supermarkets banner. In 2018, the banner opened a unique store concept in Paris, “Le 4 Casino”, combining physical and digital retail and a place to relax and socialize. Casino Supermarkets are rapidly developing omni-channel and e-commerce initiatives, such as drive & collect, click & collect or home delivery. We also work constantly to enhance the customer experience through the roll-out of new digital solutions, particularly through the Casino Max app, which covers our supermarket, hypermarket and convenience networks. As of December 31, 2020, 533 of our stores had autonomous solutions (compared to 305 as of the end of 2019), enabling them to operate without the presence of full retail staff, including in the evening and on Sundays. In 2020, digitalization of our customer experience further increased with 61% of payments at hypermarkets and 48% of payments at supermarkets carried out by smartphone or automatic checkout. Our strategic positioning has enabled us to take advantage of consumer trends in the French food retail market that have been accelerated by the two initial lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 crisis. We believe that the concurrent social distancing measures and government-imposed lockdowns boosted athome consumption as individuals increasingly worked from home and reduced restaurant dining, resulting in strong growth in demand for food retailing in the first half of 2020, particularly for the Group’s proximity formats (convenience and urban stores) and food retail sales through e-commerce channels. As an omnichannel retailer, we have been able to benefit from a first-mover advantage in addressing increased customer demand for food retail e-commerce offerings, which we believed already had the potential to grow significantly in France and demonstrated increased growth as a result of the lockdowns and social distancing measures put in place to confront the health crisis. In 2020, demand on our food e-commerce sites was particularly high. Food e-commerce sales generated triple-digit growth in the second quarter of 2020 with the deployment of click & collect and home delivery solutions in urban and convenience formats. Food e-commerce orders were up by 50% from approximately 6,500 orders per day before the crisis to approximately 10,000 orders per day at the end of the first half of 2020. 161 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

These partnerships cover two different market segments: next-day delivery for a wide range of products and express delivery in under two hours for a select range of products. Our expertise in next-day delivery has been facilitated by the exclusive partnership that began in 2017 between Monoprix and Ocado, pursuant to which an automated warehouse based on Ocado technology, the Casino O’logistique warehouse, was built in early 2020. The Casino O’logistique warehouse, which began operating in March 2020 and opened for public orders in May 2020, is designed to prepare and provide next-day delivery of Monoprix shopping baskets in Paris and areas of the Île-deFrance region covering approximately 93% of that region’s population. We believe we can generate up to approximately €500 million in annual sales per warehouse, offering customers approximately 50,000 SKUs. This disruptive and internationally sought after technology can prepare a basket of 50 items in only six minutes, offering Monoprix and Casino online customers a vast assortment of food products and the very best in service and affordability. In addition, on September 30, 2020, the O’logistique warehouse extended its activity to customers of Casino Supermarkets and Géant Casino banners. Our e-commerce offering was enhanced in 2018 with the beginning of a partnership with Amazon for express delivery of a select range of products within two hours for customers in Paris. This partnership has expanded to allow Amazon Prime Now customers access to a wide offering from Monoprix and Naturalia, as well as a large range of our Casino private-label items. As of December 31, 2020, the Monoprix store available on Amazon Prime Now included more than 7,000 items, including approximately 2,000 private-label products, and the Naturalia store on Amazon Prime Now included approximately 2,000 products. This delivery option has also expanded geographically, covering the Greater Paris Region, the Côte d’Azur (Nice and surrounding towns), Lyon and Bordeaux. In addition, we offer a full range of local home delivery options, click & collect and drive-up services across our different banners. _Cdiscount: a national champion in non-food e-commerce_ Through our Cdiscount subsidiary, we are the second largest player in non-food e-commerce in France. Cdiscount is a subsidiary of our e-commerce unit, Cnova, in which we directly hold an approximately 65% economic interest. With more than 22 million UMVs on average over the third quarter of 2020, and a record-high 26.2 million UMVs in December 2020, Cdiscount has achieved critical mass, meaning it is able to gradually shift from exclusively B2C operations to a business model more oriented toward the B2B market, due to the development of its marketplace. This transition is a key factor in developing Cdiscount’s profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Cdiscount’s GMV reached €4,207 million, up 7.9% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Cdiscount also generated EBITDA of €133 million, contributing €129 million to the Group’s consolidated EBITDA for the year. 162 ----- Cdiscount features a wide array of products, with more than 100 million product offerings, including in the home appliances, furniture, IT and culture categories. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Cdiscount marketplace represented 44% of its GMV, with accelerated growth in the second half of the year. We currently target a Cdiscount marketplace share above 50% of GMV in the medium-term. Cdiscount also offers an expanding range of services for individuals, including holiday packages, ticketing, energy plans, as well as health and financial services. Cdiscount is continuing to expand its international coverage, which already includes 27 countries in Europe. In 2019, Cdiscount entered into an alliance with three other European marketplaces, called the International Marketplace Network (IMN), to synchronize marketplace merchant offers and strengthen expansion outside France, giving Cdiscount access to roughly 230 million customers. Furthermore, Cdiscount is also developing a turnkey marketplace solution for retailers and e-merchants to address European e-commerce websites.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,Our Competitive Strengths,18.21.3,Track record of growth and value creation from new businesses,"To effectively respond to market changes, we continuously adjust our model and have developed new adjacent activities with strong growth prospects that complement our business as a retailer. These activities fall into two categories: energy, through our specialized subsidiary, GreenYellow, and data and data centers, through our subsidiaries relevanC and ScaleMax. _Photovoltaic power and energy efficiency: GreenYellow_ In 2007, we launched a new business in photovoltaic energy and energy efficiency through our subsidiary, GreenYellow, which capitalizes on our expertise in the real estate sector through our property development, construction and operation activities, as well as the favorable geographic location of our stores, mainly those located in sunny regions. Initially dedicated to managing internal energy costs, particularly through the roll-out of photovoltaic systems on the rooftops and in the car parks of our hypermarkets and supermarkets, the business has gradually developed to offer a wide range of energy solutions for external customers, benefitting from strong green energy momentum. It has three areas of expertise: the installation of photovoltaic plants and solar energy production, energy efficiency solutions and energy monitoring services. GreenYellow’s cross-cutting expertise, from both an ecological and economic standpoint, means it is able to provide its private and public customers with a wide range of solutions to produce, manage and optimize their energy consumption. Although GreenYellow is primarily positioned in France, it has extensive operations in 17 different countries outside France throughout Latin America, Asia and Africa. GreenYellow’s customer portfolio is diverse, offering services to a broad range of customers, including public authorities, private players and individuals. It offers an expanding and wide platform of innovative solutions, such as direct-to-customer natural gas offerings to Cdiscount customers, energy efficiency contracts signed with retailers in Brazil, a floating 6 MWp solar power plant in Thailand, a 1.5 MWp project completed in Cambodia and a hybrid system of solar power generation in Africa. GreenYellow has become a leading energy operator and intends to position itself as the green energy partner of choice for companies and public authorities. In order to further ramp up its development, in 2018, GreenYellow opened its capital to external investors Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance through a €150 million capital increase, following which they now together hold 24% of GreenYellow’s capital. In addition, in 2018, GreenYellow created a joint venture with Engie named Reservoir Sun, dedicated to solar self-consumption for businesses and municipalities in France, and in 2019, signed a new partnership agreement with Allego to deploy France’s largest network of ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations. 163 ----- In the first half of 2020, GreenYellow continued to develop and expand, with the signing of its 100th photovoltaic contract in Thailand, as well as a new 12MWp photovoltaic contract in South Africa, a strategic growth geography for GreenYellow. Most recently, GreenYellow entered into an energy efficiency contract for a major South African food retailer for five of its retail stores. As of December 31, 2020, it benefited from a pipeline for projects equivalent to 565 MWp, an increase from 451 MWp as of December 31, 2019 and 200 MWp as of December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GreenYellow generated an EBITDA of €64 million, contributing €57 million to the Group’s consolidated EBITDA for the year. _Data and data centers: relevanC and ScaleMax_ We have access to targeted, high-quality customer data due to our vast network of brick-and-mortar stores and high volume of e-commerce customer traffic. We have developed a consistent monetization strategy for such data, which has become a key intangible asset for retailers looking to understand consumers’ tastes and aspirations, and to anticipate upcoming changes in consumer habits. In 2018, we created 3w.relevanC, a subsidiary dedicated to the consumer data business, specialized in three areas: analyzing purchasing behavior, activating advertising campaigns and measuring the impact of offline campaigns. In February 2020, 3w.relevanC combined with Maxit, our “digital factory” that focused on technology innovation for our various banners, to form relevanC, which has grown to be a key player in digital marketing. RelevanC provides brands and retailers with customer acquisition and retention solutions, based on targeting strategies and impact measurement, via two divisions: advertising and retail tech. RelevanC’s advertising division offers clients media and marketing solutions, enhanced by transactional data, insights and measurements, to help clients meet the multi-channel marketing challenges with their target shoppers, while the retail tech division offers clients technological solutions to enable them to optimize the performance of their marketing campaigns through the use of data to personalize the customer relationship. RelevanC is focused on developing strategic partnerships with key industry players, such as through its partnership with Orange Advertising, pursuant to which it measures the impact on of television advertising on customers’ buying habits. RelevanC has developed a platform enabling the Group’s banners and suppliers to personalize their promotional campaigns and a retail media platform that uses relevanC technology to enable suppliers and marketplace vendors to buy advertising space on sites of the Group or of third parties. RelevanC generated €55 million in net sales after its demerger from 3W in the year ended December 31, 2020. On a constant-perimeter basis, relevanC recorded a year-on-year increase of more than 50%. Additionally, in December 2018, we positioned ourselves on the cloud computing market through the creation of a joint venture, ScaleMax, alongside Qarnot Computing. ScaleMax aims to run newgeneration data centers in unused spaces, such as those located in warehouses and storerooms. ScaleMax opened its first data center in the Greater Paris region (Réau, Seine-et-Marne) in a Cdiscount warehouse. This business helps the Group generate revenue through the sale of computing power to a diversified client portfolio. In addition, the installed servers generate heat, which can be used to heat the buildings where they are housed. The green energy used to power these servers is managed by GreenYellow. Since its inception, ScaleMax has doubled its computing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, over 27,000 cores had already been deployed for customers other than Group entities. In addition, ScaleMax has secured contracts 164 ----- with a broad range of clients, including several banking clients, start-ups specialized in artificial intelligence and 3D animation studios. In 2020, ScaleMax continued its development through a series of strategic initiatives, including increased computation capacity through a new data center inside the Cdiscount warehouse in Verpilleux and the diversification of its customer base across various industries. During the COVID-19 lockdown period, ScaleMax was able to make computing capacity available to the Folding@home project for research against COVID-19.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,Our Competitive Strengths,18.21.4,High-growth operations in attractive Latin American markets,"Through our interests in GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito, we have a highly developed network of retail banners in a number of attractive formats in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Uruguay. The Latin American business benefits from attractive markets with strong underlying macroeconomic trends, including a growing population of over 300 million, which is favorable for food retailers. As an established player in these markets, we believe we stand to benefit from the favorable demographics of these countries. Through the Latam Reorganization Transactions, we recently simplified our holding structure in Latin America to unlock further value in our Latin American business. Despite a high rate of urbanization, the penetration rate of modern grocery stores in these markets remains relatively low. As a result of this, as well as the rapid development in these countries of digitalization and urbanization rates, we expect rapid structural changes in the region. In this context, we believe that retail groups like ours with extensive digital know-how and omni-channel capabilities are well positioned to benefit from growth in Latin America, where digital media has had an extensive impact. In 2020, our Latin American businesses generated sales of €14.7 billion, with €6.1 billion in sales for Assaí, €3.6 billion for Grupo Éxito and €4.9 billion for the Multivarejo segment of GPA. In Brazil, GPA was the largest player in grocery retail and Assaí was one of the largest players in the cash & carry market in 2020, with net sales of €11,019 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 for GPA and Assaí combined. As of December 31, 2020, GPA and Assaí had a network of 1,507 stores throughout the country, through the Multivarejo and Assaí banners, respectively. GPA and Assaí are active across various formats, channels and regions of Brazil. As of March 8, 2021, the market value of Casino Group’s shares in GPA and Assaí was €1.6 billion (based on GPA’s and Assaí’s share prices and the spot foreign exchange rate between the euro and the Brazilian real on that date). In early 2021, we took a further step to increase our strategic focus and enhance valuation, through the spin-off of Assaí, which was listed on the Novo Mercado Segment of B3 – Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. (formerly BM&F Bovespa) stock exchange on March 1, 2021. In 2020, Assaí, which was then GPA’s cash & carry banner, was one of the country’s largest players in this segment based on market share, according to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2021 edition. Assaí has shown organic growth in net sales of 26% per annum in the last four years. Assaí continues to pursue the profitable expansion of stores, with 42 store openings in the two years ended December 31, 2020, and include 184 stores to date. GPA also conducts its retail business through its Multivarejo segment, offering customers a wide range of products and services through various formats and banners. In 2020, GPA’s hypermarkets showed strong development of online sales, as well as improved sales and gross margins, and GPA recorded an increase in EBITDA margin of 2.7 percentage points as compared to the end of 2019. 165 ----- GPA is also a pioneer in food e-commerce, digital transformation and innovation in Brazil. Its digital initiatives include: - James Delivery: In December 2018, GPA acquired 100% of the startup that operates the application James Delivery, a multiservice platform for ordering and delivering various products. As of December 31, 2020, James Delivery expanded its delivery service offering to 32 cities. - Digital loyalty program: The “My Discount” mobile application, which enables customers to access and use customized coupons, represents a large portion of GPA’s customers registered under loyalty programs. - Cheftime: At the end of 2018, GPA entered into a partnership with Cheftime, a foodtech startup that sells individual gastronomic kits and offers customers an online subscription service. Implemented under the Pão de Açúcar banner, Cheftime has exceeded initial expectations, in particular due to strong consumer demand for its rotisserie products. - Partnerships with startups: GPA has created an internal lab to reinforce its cooperation with startups and achieve increased speed and efficiency in its product launches. - Microsoft: GPA has entered into a partnership with Microsoft to design a new store model, with sensors capable of interacting with its banners’ digital platforms and additional features such as lockers, facial recognition and self-checkout. - Stix Fidelidade: GPA has entered into a coalition with Raia Drogasil, a leading Brazilian drugstore retailer, to further strengthen and broaden its customers’ power of choice by offering customers the ability to purchase products and services to accumulate or redeem points. In the second half of 2020, Stix Fidelidade served more than 60 million of GPA and Raia Drogasil’s loyal customers. We operate in Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina through Grupo Éxito, which generated €3,637 million in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Grupo Éxito operated a network of 2,101 stores, with a diverse range of formats and innovative propositions. Grupo Éxito also offers consumers a complementary offering of financial services and consumer finance options through its finance joint venture Tuya. Finally, Grupo Éxito has successfully leveraged its significant real estate holdings by launching and growing a commercial property development business, Viva Malls, the largest commercial property developer in Colombia, with approximately 758,000 square meters of GLA, including 17 shopping centers and 17 outdoor malls as of December 31, 2020. In Colombia, where Grupo Éxito is the leading modern grocery retailer (according to Euromonitor International’s Retailing 2021 Edition), Grupo Éxito has launched several initiatives in relation to food ecommerce, digitalization and innovation. These initiatives include: - Mobile applications: The Éxito and Carulla banners launched mobile applications in the first quarter of 2019 that enable customers to access customized coupons. In the third quarter of 2020, App Annie ranked the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications as the second most downloaded applications for online food shopping in Colombia in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, these applications had been downloaded nearly two million times. 166 ----- - Rappi: Grupo Éxito has entered into a strategic partnership with Rappi, a delivery service startup, to improve its delivery services. - Carulla Smart Market: In December 2019, Grupo Éxito launched Carulla SmartMarket, the first smart retail store in Colombia, providing nearly twenty high-tech shopping experiences, such as facial recognition payment, an electronic sommelier and fully digital shopping experience. Grupo Éxito, through its banners Devoto, Disco and Géant, is a leading food retailer in Uruguay. Although Grupo Éxito offers a range of different formats in Uruguay, it has particularly focused its expansion efforts on its Devoto Express convenience stores. In addition, Grupo Éxito has implemented an operational excellence program in order to boost productivity and counteract the effects of inflation on operating expenses. As a result of such efforts, Grupo Éxito’s Uruguayan operations are highly profitable, with a 10.3% EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2020, as published by Grupo Éxito. In Argentina, the Libertad banners are present in the Córdoba region, with 25 hypermarkets and convenience stores. In line with its dual retail and real estate business strategy, Libertad continues to seek opportunities to optimize its real estate portfolio, with a total GLA of approximately 170,000 square meters in 15 shopping centers as of December 31, 2020, making Libertad the third-largest real estate player in Argentina. Libertad’s shopping centers had an occupancy rate of 90% for the year ended December 31, 2020, with 96.2% of its tenants being local small- and medium-sized businesses, which is higher than the average recorded by local competitors.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,Our Competitive Strengths,18.21.5,Rated best-in-class for ESG commitments,"Our commitment to ESG has been recognized by a number of leading ESG rating agencies. In December 2020, Vigeo Eiris ranked our Group as the number one European retailer for its ESG policy and commitments, selecting us as first out of 129 French companies for our climate and environmental protection commitments, human resources policies, corporate governance and employee relations and human resources policies. In addition, in October 2020, we were the only retailer in the Wall Street Journal’s list of the world’s top 100 most sustainably managed companies. With an AA overall rating, we were also in the top quartile of MSCI’s ESG scores in global food retail & staples. We have also received top ESG scores by FTSE4Good (4/5), RobecoSAM (70/100), Sustainalytics (72/100) and CDP (B). As a group that is committed to a sustainable retail model, our ESG policies are particularly important to us. We seek constant improvement in our non-financial performance in order to address the concerns of customers who are sensitive to the impact of their purchases. Our program gives us the foundation to build trusted relationships with our partners and suppliers, strengthen employee motivation and attract top talent. Since 2002, our commitment to sustainable development has been supported by a system of organization and governance involving managers at all levels of our Group, including the highest level of our management team. Our CSR department, which operates under and reports to the General Secretary of the Executive Committee, has rolled out the “CSR Spirit”, continuously improving our ESG program in France and abroad 167 ----- in coordination with the various subsidiary CSR departments. The below table presents a summary of our key ESG commitments. Group Ethics Charter United Nations Sustainable Paris Climate Agreement Development Goals (SDG) Universal Declaration of Eight fundamental conventions of Montreal Protocol Human Rights the ILO United Nations Global Compact UN Women’s Empowerment Science Based Targets (SBT) Principles _Our environmental commitment_ Determined to improve our environmental footprint, we were the first French retailer to adopt carbon emission reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative, which is led by the United Nations’ Global Compact and the WWF. Since 2015, we have also committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18% by 2025 as compared to 2015 (on a Group basis), and have already met this target in France, having reduced our emissions by 18% in 2020 alone, and 34% from 2015 to 2020. This performance is due in part to the activities of GreenYellow, our subsidiary and an energy efficiency and renewable energy expert. At Monoprix, we set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 as compared to 2020 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. We are also committed to reaching a target of 100% of reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging for our Casino private-label products by 2025. Moreover, part of our commitment to offering sustainable food to our consumers is to ensure sustainable sourcing. In 2020, we achieved our target of sourcing 100% of the palm oil used in our French private-label products from sources certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil. _Our commitment to promoting health and animal welfare_ We aim to offer healthy and sustainable food to all of our customers, including those with the lowest income. In addition to increasing our organic offering to approximately €1.3 billion in net sales in 2020, we have continued to strengthen our range of responsible products. Moreover, we have pledged to label all of our Casino private-label food products with Nutri-Scores by 2021. For many years now, we have been working closely with suppliers, local production chains and animal rights organizations in a commitment to offering products that are more respectful of animal welfare. To drive a cycle of continuous improvement, we cultivate dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including NGOs, veterinarians, suppliers, production chains, consumers and employees, in the hope that these initiatives will improve and broaden the array of animal-welfare friendly products on its store shelves and enable customers to enjoy better quality products made from more ethically treated animals. The chosen approach consists of both monitoring conditions in the breeding, transport and slaughtering process and supporting the production chains as they transition to better, more welfare-friendly practices. Our assertive commitment was recognized by the Business Benchmark on Animal Farm Welfare (BBFAW), which in 2019 rated our performance as Tier 3, at the top of French retailers on this issue. Consumer awareness plays a critical role in improving the treatment of farm animals, and to inform shoppers about the animal welfare aspects of the products they buy, we developed a labeling system in collaboration with three recognized animal rights organizations (including Compassion in World Farming), 168 |Group Ethics Charter|United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)|Paris Climate Agreement| |---|---|---| |Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Eight fundamental conventions of the ILO|Montreal Protocol| |United Nations Global Compact|UN Women’s Empowerment Principles|Science Based Targets (SBT)| ----- which will help to support standardized animal welfare labeling in France. The labels were initially prepared for broiler chickens, with the first labeled products appearing in stores in December 2018. At the beginning of 2020, the program was extended to other distributors and producers. _Our social commitment_ We have a longstanding commitment in favor of gender equality and diversity. In 2020, 52% of our 205,769 employees, and 40.4% of our Group-wide employees at the management level, were women (reflecting a 4.2 percentage point increase compared to 2015). In addition, in 2020, more than 8,460 of our employees were classified as having a disability, representing an increase of 27% compared to 2015 (in Brazil, this figure represents an increase of 108% since 2015). We are also committed to diversity in age, with 49% of our workforce between 30 to 50 years old, 37% under the age of 30 years old and 14% were 50 years old and over in 2020. We believe we are the first French retail group to be awarded the Equality and Diversity Label by the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR). We are also strongly committed to supporting the most vulnerable through our various charitable foundations. In 2020, our collection and donation initiatives resulted in the donation of nearly 18,800 tons of food products (equivalent to 37.6 million meals) to food banks or other social welfare organizations. In Brazil, GPA deploys a number of annual initiatives, inviting clients to donate food and products to social institutions. In 2020, GPA donated 993 tons of food and products, including 11,758 tons of food collected on Solidarity Day, GPA’s yearly initiative with over 100 partner organizations. Through the Éxito Foundation, Grupo Éxito also supports numerous initiatives to fight malnutrition in Colombia. During the COVID-19 crisis, we were fully engaged in both France and South America, donating two million masks to French hospitals and setting designated shopping hours for the elderly and healthcare professionals, among other initiatives. _Our governance commitment_ Our Board of Directors is strongly committed to diversity. Catherine Lucet, the lead independent Director, is also a member of the Audit Committee and Chair of the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee. There are no controlling shareholder representatives on any of our Board Committees. Further, 46% of our Board members are women. Our Board is strongly committed to its initiatives, as evidenced by the 10 meetings (97.9% attendance rate) and the 22 meetings of our committees (98.6% attendance rate) which took place in 2020.

We have demonstrated an ability to deliver on a number of ambitious asset disposal plans that we have launched in recent years. Beginning in 2018, following successive reviews of our business portfolio, we have undertaken the Asset Disposal Plan, pursuant to which we have set a cumulative goal of €4.5 billion in asset disposals in order to accelerate the completion of our strategic focus on attractive formats (including e-commerce, premium and convenience) and geographies, and on new businesses (such as energy, data and data centers). We have completed €2.8 billion in disposals as of December 31, 2020. The table below summarizes the disposals made under the Asset Disposal Plan as of December 31, 2020: 169 ----- In addition, in June 2018, we launched the Rocade Plan to dispose of or close loss making stores, particularly in our Géant Hypermarkets and Casino Supermarket formats. Store disposals and closures have allowed us to focus on our most profitable stores. The table below summarizes our valuable asset base. (1) 24% held by Tikehau and Bpifrance.

In addition to asset disposals, we have carried out in the past, and are continuing to carry out, a number of initiatives to improve our France Retail and E-commerce trading profit and free cash flow generation to support further reductions in our net debt. Such initiatives include reductions in operating costs, working capital and capital expenditures. With respect to our operating costs, such initiatives include cost-saving measures, the Rocade plan (whereby the disposal or closure of loss-making stores initiated in 2018 had an effect in the year ended December 31, 2020 of €43 million of non-recurring costs) and recurring savings from transformation plans initiated in the full-year 2020 (estimated at €60 million in the second half of 2020).

(2) Restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 16. Our capital expenditures primarily consist of the construction and remodeling of our stores, investments in digitalization and our infrastructure, including improvements to our information technology systems and our distribution facilities. We have completed major transformation programs, which led to a reduction of France Retail annual capital expenditures of over €200 million from 2018 to 2019, reflecting our capital expenditure control, with priority investments in digital activities and Monoprix. In France, including Cdiscount, gross capital expenditure increased from €437 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €505 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the accelerated store digitalization and the change in business model for GreenYellow. For 2021, we aim to control the levels of gross capital expenditure in the Group excluding GreenYellow, the development and transition of which to a companyowned asset model is intended to be financed primarily by its own resources. Our gross capital expenditure in France (including Cdiscount) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 is presented below. We have also pursued a business model at Cdiscount that we believe will drive profitability in addition to the strong fundaments behind e-commerce performance. These include increasing the share of marketplace contribution to GMV, improving margins on direct sales and launching a turnkey marketplace solution as a service offer to address the broader European market.

We aim to adjust our mix of formats to best position our business for long-term growth. We also aim to continue to expand our premium and convenience store formats which we believe will continue to be particularly promising over the medium term. We opened 169 premium and convenience stores in 2020, and we target 300 new store openings in the first half of 2021 (representing an acceleration and expansion of our previously stated goal of 300 new store openings for 2020 and 2021 cumulatively). In particular, to take advantage of consumers’ increased preference for organic products, we intend to develop our organic product offering in each of our banners and speed up the expansion of Naturalia, our organic specialized banner. Through this and the promotion of organic products through our digital 173 ----- distribution channels, including our partnership with Amazon Prime, we believe that our net sales of organic products will continue to increase over the next few years. We also plan to enhance our existing store network in France to meet changes in consumers’ tastes and needs. We intend to continue developing new concepts and services in our stores, such as the Monoprix Phénomène concept, a design store concept built in collaboration with Pixelis, Le Drugstore Parisien, a partnership with L’Oréal Paris, and Le 4 Casino, a phygital store with several digital innovations. In 2019, we launched a pilot store in Paris for a new concept, Darwin, a Franprix store offering consumers a host of conveniences, including full kitchen access, a large seating and dining area and the ability to shop for products from other brands, such as Cdiscount, Decathlon and home goods retailer Hema, in store. We also intend to provide catering services across our various banners, such as in-store salad bars and snack areas. Finally, we intend to expand our network of autonomous stores in order to improve customer service and increase net sales from expanded opening hours.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

We intend to leverage favorable consumer trends and our strong experience in digital and omni-channel offerings by increasing our focus on efforts to expand our e-commerce activities in food retail, further developing our Cdiscount business, growing our digital customer relationships and rolling out further innovative concepts and solutions. Leveraging on the full deployment of our partnership with Ocado through the ramp up of a fully automated warehouse opened in March 2020 and with the expansion of the delivery area through which Amazon Prime customers can order Monoprix, Casino private-label and Naturalia products, we aim to further increase food e-commerce sales in the near to medium term. In our pure-play e-commerce business, we intend to continue to increase Cdiscount’s GMV through the further development of our marketplace, which we expect will account for an increasing share of Cdiscount’s GMV in the coming years. We also intend to further expand Cdiscount’s business-to-business and business-to-customer services offering within France, and to more generally expand Cdiscount’s operations to other European countries through direct delivery to countries neighboring France and the further development of partnerships with marketplaces abroad. As a result of the growth in its marketplace, Cdiscount has been able to shift its customer base to a model more oriented towards business clients and it intends to continue to focus on the development of their services for its clients. For example, Cdiscount is developing a turnkey marketplace service to address 900,000 European e-commerce websites. Finally, we aim to reinforce our digital customer relationships through the increased penetration of our banners’ mobile applications. In October 2018, we launched Le 4 Casino, the first store in France without a traditional cashier, the technology of which was deployed in 533 stores as of December 31, 2020, enabling them to operate autonomously in the evening and on Sundays without the presence of cashiers. In March 2019, we opened a logistics innovation lab in the Géant hypermarket in Pessac, France, where we test technology solutions in partnership with the most innovative startups in the field. Our innovation initiatives also include new activities with strong growth potential, such as the deployment of electrical vehicle charging stations in our parking lots. Each of these projects, in line with our asset-light strategy, have been developed in exclusive or limited partnerships with startups, franchisees with long-standing relationships with us or with other external specialist teams. 174 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In our solar energy business, we aim to further bolster our leadership position while developing newer activities. We aim to consolidate GreenYellow’s leadership position in solar energy with a target to increase its installed capacity, which has already grown significantly, with a pipeline representing 565 MWp of future projects as of December 31, 2020. We also aim to consolidate our leadership position in solar self-consumption in France by continuing to develop our joint venture partnership with Engie, pursuant to which we help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their electricity needs. Further, we plan to continue growing our energy performance contract offering, which is a contract with GreenYellow through which GreenYellow commits to achieve reductions in energy costs and total energy consumed, with external customers. To date, more than 2,600 customers have entered into such contracts. Finally, we intend to further develop our services and expand our offering through new projects such as the deployment of a network of ultra-fast vehicle charging stations, direct-to-consumer natural gas offerings and the development of new solar energy plants, such as the recently completed suspended solar energy plant on a rooftop in Thailand. We also plan to continue growing our data and data centers businesses, relevanC (which generated €55 million in net sales after its demerger from 3w in the year ended December 31, 2020) and ScaleMax, in order to increase the potential contribution from such businesses. We expect to target such growth through accelerating the development of relevanC’s customer base, as well as expanding the number of data center sites in our logistics warehouses and hypermarket stocking areas for our ScaleMax operations. We also intend to promote our platform enabling retailers and suppliers to personalize promotional campaigns, and our retail media platform enabling suppliers and marketplace vendors to buy advertising space.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In Brazil, the strategy of GPA is centered on four key pillars: - Scale-up of GPA’s digital platform: GPA intends to increase its revenue by reinforcing and complementing its digital and e-commerce initiatives, particularly through the integration of its existing assets and new initiatives to benefit from the network effect created by the combination of a leading platform for food e-commerce in Brazil, a new marketplace platform, a newly created fulfillment platform (James and GPA Logistics), a loyalty platform (through the historical Cliente Mais and Clube Extra programs which have over 20 million members and 175 ----- the Stix program with over than 60 million members) and a monetization platform (media and insights). - Accelerated organic expansion of premium formats, such as Pão de Açúcar and Minuto Pão de Açúcar, in dense urban areas, while maintaining such formats’ high profitability level. - Growth of regional banners, including Mercado Extra and Compre Bem, through organic expansion, potential M&A opportunities and format development through strategic price positioning and a focus on fresh food categories and high-quality service. - Increase in the profitability of hypermarkets. In 2020, 23 GPA hypermarkets successfully migrated to a new value proposition based on three pillars: (i) competitiveness in grocery offerings, (ii) quality of fresh food categories, (ii) streamlining of non-food and specialty items. The remaining GPA 80 hypermarkets are also expected to migrate to this new value proposition by the end of 2021. The strategy of Assaí is to continue its accelerated expansion plan. Seven new stores are currently under construction, and three hypermarkets from Extra were transferred to Assaí before the conclusion of the spin-off to contribute to expansion of the brand. In addition, the Group has earmarked 40 plots of land in its portfolio for future store expansions of Assaí. We intend to continue Grupo Éxito’s transformation strategy by carrying out a number of different initiatives. - Focus on fast-growing formats: Grupo Éxito plans to expand the cash & carry format in Colombia through additional openings and conversion of existing stores into stores under the Surtimayorista banner. Grupo Éxito also intends to continue launching new concepts in Colombia, such as the Éxito WOW concept in its hypermarkets, which offers a complete revamp of its food and non-food product selection, and the FreshMarket concept in its Carulla premium supermarkets, with an improved selection of fresh and healthy products. - Digital transformation: Grupo Éxito believes that local market conditions are favorable for the development of omni-channel marketing solutions, including increased e-commerce, retail mobile applications and last-mile delivery services. Consequently, Grupo Éxito intends to accelerate the development of its digital and omni-channel activities in Colombia through efforts to increase the number of users of the Éxito and Carulla mobile applications and expanding the Puntos Colombia loyalty program application that Grupo Éxito has developed in partnership with Bancolombia with rewards that can be used by customers at several companies. - Property development: Grupo Éxito plans to continue expanding its Viva Malls property development business in Colombia, which has become the leading player in the Colombian commercial property market. We are further seeking ways to increase the strategic focus of our Latam Retail operations. GPA recently completed the spin-off of Assaí from the rest of its activities. The goal of this transaction is to unleash the full potential of Assaí, on the one hand, and of the more traditional retail businesses of GPA and Grupo Éxito, on the other hand. This separation is expected to allow them to operate on a standalone basis, to focus on their respective business models and market opportunities. They are also expected to benefit from direct access to the capital markets and other sources of funding and eliminate corporate 176 ----- inefficiencies, creating more value for their respective shareholders.

We believe these policies have already paid off, allowing us to comply with the financial covenant in our Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020, and will help support deleveraging in the coming years. The applicable maintenance covenant levels of under the Revolving Credit Facility from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020, along with our historical leverage ratios as calculated in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2020, are illustrated below. 177 ----- (1) Adjusted gross debt for the France Retail and E-commerce segments, as such segments are defined in accordance with the provisions of the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture.

In addition to respecting the restricted payments covenants applicable under the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Indenture, we also intend to continue our efforts to improve cash generation through: - improving our working capital requirements, primarily through reducing inventories; and - continuing to focus our retail gross capital expenditures on initiatives that we believe will have a favorable impact on the development of our business, including investments in digital activities and our Monoprix banner. Finally, we aim to continue reducing our France Retail and E-commerce gross debt through the use of the proceeds from our Asset Disposal Plan, and further improve our cash generation through the reduction of financial expenses associated therewith.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.23,Our Businesses,18.23.1,Our Retail Businesses,"We operate retail businesses through both brick-and-mortar retail outlets and via online sales. Our operations are established in two balanced and structured geographic regions: France and Latin America. We are generally focused on selective international development and on high potential markets, such as Brazil and Colombia, where GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito hold co-leadership and leadership positions, respectively. Our physical retail businesses operate under several banners, each of which has a distinct format. The principal formats of our retail stores include: - _supermarkets, which are large self-service stores that primarily sell food products; 178 ----- - _convenience stores, which are small stores that typically carry everyday essential food and non-food products and are generally located in city and town centers; - _premium stores, which cater to an urban clientele, offering food products with a large proportion of fresh, organic options and service counters and superior quality non-food products; - _hypermarkets, which are stores with very large surface areas that offer a wide range of food and non-food goods under a single roof, typically located in suburbs and other locations outside of city centers; - _discount stores, which are supermarkets and convenience stores that cater to a price- sensitive clientele; and - _cash & carry stores, which offer goods on a self-service wholesale basis to customers. As a modern major retailer operating in competitive markets, we are also focused on developing our multi-channel pioneering position by leveraging our deep local roots to establish ourselves as a leader in the e-commerce market. From Cdiscount’s leadership model in France, to the specific digital strategies of our banners and key partnerships with international leaders in technology and logistics, we are committed to adapting to our customers’ changing preferences in the global multi-channel space. As of December 31, 2020, 5,422 stores in our network were operated by franchisees in France and 1,470 by aliados in Colombia. We have franchise contracts pursuant to which a franchisee pays a fee to license the rights to a banner, receives a fixed allowance from us to set up the store, and then mostly purchases merchandise for sale through our central purchasing agency, on which we earn a margin. In addition, some joint ventures have been set up between us and a master franchisee that in turn owns one or more franchised stores. Through franchises, we can expand our store network while pursuing our asset-light strategy. Franchising allows us to maintain net sales while minimizing cost outlays. Through franchise contracts, we recognize net sales on the goods we sell our franchisees through our central purchasing agency. On the other hand, overhead costs like leases and personnel costs, as well as capital expenditures, are shared or limited. For joint venture franchises, we either fully consolidate or recognize our share of the net income of such stores. As part of our international strategy, we enter into partnerships in markets in which we are not present, either through licensing our banners to affiliates in international markets or through private-label product supply agreements. In addition, we have a number of supply agreements in place whereby we provide private-label products to leading local retailers in various international markets. We believe that these brands can be particularly popular with consumers, as they represent a sought-after French lifestyle. _France_ Our France Retail operations, which include both our French food retail and non-retail businesses, are concentrated in France, the birthplace of Casino Group, where we are a leading retailer. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our France Retail segment recorded net sales of €15,219 million and EBITDA of €1,451 million. For year ended December 31, 2020, 49% of our France Retail net sales was generated by convenience stores, 20% was generated by supermarkets, 25% was generated by hypermarkets and 5% was generated by other formats, as compared to 45%, 19%, 28% and 8% respectively, in 2019. 179 ----- _Retail Businesses_ Our French retail businesses serve customers through a network of 7,634 stores as of December 31, 2020. We conduct our retail businesses within the France Retail segment under several banners, each of which offers a key range of products that are constantly evolving to anticipate new modes of consumption and adapt to all types of customers, local lifestyles and environments. These diverse banners present a balanced mix of activities, brands and formats, including urban, service, convenience and hypermarket store formats, each of which reach out to customers through multiple channels. In recent years, we have increasingly focused on accelerating the development of our omni-channel strategy for our retail businesses. In 2019, we expanded our partnership with Amazon to include the sale of our private-label and Naturalia products on Amazon Prime Now, the expansion of delivery zones throughout France and the installation of Amazon Lockers in over 1,000 of our Group retail locations in France. By the end of 2020, this partnership covered Paris, Nice, Lyon and Bordeaux, and it is currently expanding to Montpellier in the first quarter 2021. In addition, in 2020, different banners of the Group established partnerships with other players in food delivery players such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo. Further, as of December 31, 2020, 533 of our French retail stores were equipped with the technology to operate autonomously and allow customers to shop in the evening or on Sundays without going through a physical checkout. This concept, which has extended across our supermarket, hypermarket and convenience formats, has proven effective in boosting customer traffic, allowing us to recruit new customers as the extended hours of operation allow us to stay open with little to no competition. In the three months ended December 31, 2020, 61% of hypermarket and 48% of supermarket sales were made by smartphone or self-service checkout, as compared to 45% and 36% of sales, respectively, for the period between February through March 2020. The COVID-19 crisis has further accelerated the development of our food e-commerce retail offerings across all of our banners and expanded delivery models. In response to the crisis, our food ecommerce sales were up by 67% on a like-for-like basis across our expanded delivery models. Monoprix Our premium banner, Monoprix, is the leading French omni-channel city-center retailer, aiming to maximize convenience and customer enjoyment through providing innovative services and a differentiated offering. As of December 31, 2020, 799 stores operated under the Monoprix banner in France and abroad. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Monoprix stores, including all of its various formats, recorded net sales of €4,537 million. Monoprix stores are located in more than 250 town and city centers in France and aim to provide consumers with a diversified product offering, including both food and non-food items such as cosmetics, apparel and housewares, from both name brands and private-label brands, all under a single roof in a modern and friendly environment. Monoprix has also developed other formats: - _Naturalia a leading retailer specializing in natural and organic products, with 216 stores as of December 31, 2020 offering more than 10,000 items. - _Monop’ an ultra-convenience concept. These practical, welcoming stores provide a varied offering that meets basic daily needs and provides specialty product options. Monop’ operates in busy urban areas, including in partnership with train stations, and along 180 ----- motorways. As of December 31, 2020, 132 stores operated under the Monop’ concept, catering to an active, urban clientele. - _Monop’Daily a concept combining fast food with ultra-fresh products. With an average selling area of 50 to 100 square meters, Monop’Daily stores offer a broad range of snacks, ready meals, dairy products, beverages, fruit and desserts. As of December 31, 2020, 31 stores operated under the Monop’Daily concept. In 2018, we ramped up Monoprix’s omni-channel strategy by signing a partnership with Amazon to offer Monoprix grocery items with express same-day delivery to Amazon Prime Now customers in Paris, which has now been extended to include the Greater Paris Region (35 cities), Lyon, Bordeaux and the Côte d’Azur (12 cities). Our partnership with Amazon has further developed to include Naturalia products. As of December 31, 2020, the Monoprix store available on Amazon Prime Now included more than 7,000 items, including approximately 2,000 private-label products, and the Naturalia store on Amazon Prime Now included approximately 2,000 products. Our partnership with Amazon complements Monoprix’s exclusive alliance with Ocado in France, entered into in late 2017, pursuant to which an automated warehouse based on Ocado technology, the Casino O’logistique warehouse, was built in early 2020 in the Paris suburbs for home delivery of large basket sizes. The warehouse became operational in May 2020 and covers a delivery area consisting of 93% of the population of in Île-de-France. On September 30, 2020, the O’logistique warehouse extended its activity to customers of Casino Supermarkets and Géant Casino banners. With the development and ramp-up of this warehouse, Monoprix has been able to offer its customers next-day delivery in extended delivery zones. Lastly, in 2018, Monoprix acquired Sarenza, an online fashion and personal goods retailer, with a view to making Monoprix.fr a leader in the fashion and personal goods segment in France, and to consolidate its position in non-food e-commerce. Casino Supermarkets Casino Supermarkets is a banner of supermarkets operating in French city centers and rural areas, focused on a strong commitment to pleasure, taste, high-quality fresh produce, knowledgeable food service personnel, choice and customer service, and backed up by innovative digital solutions. As of December 31, 2020, 419 stores operated under the Casino banner, of which of which 71 stores were operated by franchise affiliates in France and 24 stores were operated by franchise affiliates outside of France. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Casino Supermarkets recorded net sales of €2,896 million. Casino Supermarkets are concentrated in three primary regions of France: southeastern France, the Rhône Valley and greater Paris. Casino Supermarkets have an average selling area of 1,600 square meters. Casino Supermarkets offer mainly food products, including organic and fresh produce, in-house pastries and baked goods, as well as an array of non-food products, including capsule homeware and apparel collections. Casino Supermarkets continue to develop their omni-channel offering and novel ways of expanding customers’ digital experience, such as through the opening of Le 4 Casino in Paris, which was designed to offer customers a unique shopping experience, including a variety of innovative digital services enabling customers to shop 24 hours a day, seven days a week without going through a physical checkout, to easily locate products in store, to choose from a broader range of products and services through digital interfaces and to find more detailed information about the products on offer. In addition, the banner has adopted the Casino Max app, which offers features including express scanning, payment facilities, and targeted digital promotions. Since December 31, 2019, most Casino Supermarkets offered e-commerce solutions to their customers, such as click-and-drive service, where consumers can order their groceries online and pick them up at a drive-through or a dedicated counter. To provide maximum convenience to its customers during the 181 ----- lockdown period, Casino supermarkets accelerated the development of its home delivery solution, expanding to over 71 cities to date (with orders in Île-de-France fulfilled through our O’logistique warehouse), and established a partnership with Uber Eats. Franprix Franprix is the Group’s main hyper-convenience banner for urban areas. Franprix stores are mainly established in Paris and its surrounding areas, with almost all of its stores concentrated in this region, and in the heart of large French cities in the Rhône Valley and the Mediterranean basin. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 872 stores operated under the Franprix banner, including 479 franchises. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Franprix stores generated net sales of €1,579 million. With an average selling area of 400 square meters per store, Franprix stores offer a range of food products intended to satisfy the daily needs of consumers, combining essential national brands and privatelabel brands. In 2015, we launched the Mandarine concept for Franprix stores, intended to transform them into friendly, practical and pleasant stores. Since then, the concept has grown in line with the innovations created by the banner to drive food service solutions, healthy and responsible ranges (e.g., scoop-andweigh), and services aimed at giving Franprix stores the feel of a local grocery store. These include in-store snacking areas, fresh fruit juicers, bicycle pump access, phone charging stations, public WiFi access, instore microwaves and quick delivery options. Ease of access and flexible opening hours also contribute to the success of the Franprix banner, which launched its first stores that are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week in 2018. In 2019, the Franprix banner explored new store concepts, including Noé, which offers an increased range of organic and vegan products in an inviting atmosphere, and Le Drugstore Parisien, a partnership with L’Oréal Paris offering a wide selection of beauty products. Franprix continues to focus on innovation in the food retail sector. In September 2019, it entered into a partnership with Hema, a Dutch company specializing in low-cost trendy housing gadgets and décor, to offer Hema products in its stores. That same month, Franprix opened a pilot store in with its new, innovative Darwin concept, which offers customers full kitchen access, including access to pizza ovens and fryers, a large seating area, larger scoop-and-weigh offerings and a selection of Hema and Cdiscount products. In July 2020, it launched its partnership with Decathlon, a French sporting goods retailer, to offer Decathlon corners in its stores. Géant Casino Géant Casino is our French hypermarket banner, which offers leading food brands with highquality traditional food selections, local fresh produce and a large organic product range and non-food products. Géant Casino hypermarkets provide ample retail space on a human scale, with the average area measuring 7,048 square meters as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 105 hypermarkets operated under the Géant Casino banner, of which 4 stores were operated by affiliates in France and 7 stores were operated by affiliates outside of France. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Géant Casino stores recorded net sales of €3,620 million. In recent years, we have focused on our most profitable locations, reduced retail space and repositioned our Géant Casino offering to favor product categories and channels adapted to customers’ preferences. For example, our non-food offering is presented in a connected, user-friendly boutique format and focuses on leisure goods and homeware, enhanced by in-store sales counters in collaboration with Cdiscount, HEMA, C&A, Claire’s and Maty & Piery. As of December 31, 2020, there were 53 Cdiscount counters in Géant Casino’s hypermarkets, which we believe has had a positive impact on our sales. 182 ----- In line with its multi-channel approach and with a view to digitizing the store experience, the banner has adopted the Casino Max app, which offers features including express scanning, payment facilities, and targeted digital promotions. In addition, to provide maximum convenience to its customers, Géant Casino has developed a home delivery solution in over 71 cities to date (with orders in Île-de-France fulfilled through our O’logistique warehouse) and established a partnership with Uber Eats during the lockdown period.

GreenYellow In 2007, we created GreenYellow, a business centered on solar energy and energy efficiency. Although GreenYellow primarily operates in France, it has expanded its operations to international markets in 17 different countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America. GreenYellow capitalizes on our expertise in the real estate sector through our knowledge of property development, construction and operation, as well as on the favorable geographic location of our stores, to offer public and private customers a wide range of solutions to produce and manage their energy. GreenYellow, which began by installing rooftop photovoltaic systems and energy efficiency solutions in our stores, today ranks as a leading French player in rooftop photovoltaic systems, benefitting from strong green energy momentum. As of December 31, 2019, GreenYellow held a project pipeline of 451 MWp representing a three-fold increase as compared to its previous year pipeline. As of December 31, 2020, GreenYellow’s pipeline increased to 565 MWp. In terms of energy efficiency, GreenYellow deployed more than 2,600 energy efficiency agreements and helped its clients save an estimated €85 million of energy costs. GreenYellow had an overall positive carbon impact, avoiding the emission of 273,000 tons of CO2 in 2020, the equivalent of the annual energy footprint of approximately one million French 183 ----- households. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2020, GreenYellow recorded EBITDA of €64 million, contributing €57 million to the Group’s consolidated EBITDA for the year. GreenYellow’s main areas of expertise include: - The decentralized production of energy, such as through the integration of solar panels on roofs and car parks: GreenYellow has developed, built and operated over 219 power plants in France and internationally, both on sites that belong to our Group as well as sites belonging to third parties, including industrial sites, communities and businesses. One example of a GreenYellow installation is its construction of the largest solar plant in Colombia on the roof of our Éxito Panorama store in Baranquilla. With over 2,800 square meters of solar panels, the installation can produce approximately 700 MWh per year, representing approximately 24% of the store’s electricity consumption. Another example of a GreenYellow installation is the Viva store located in Baranquilla. This plant has approximately 6,300 square meters of solar panels that can produce approximately 780 MWh per year. In 2018, GreenYellow established Reservoir Sun, a joint venture with leading electric company, Engie, to provide solar self-consumption for businesses and municipalities, which successfully secured projects for 100MWp in one year. GreenYellow has also carried out significant innovative projects in 2019, such as the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles (a joint venture signed between GreenYellow and the Meridiam fund, in partnership with Allego) and is moving to digitalize and automate the energy consumption implementation and monitoring for the benefit of its clients. - Promoting energy efficiency through energy performance contracts: Through energy performance contracts (“CPEs”), more than 2,500 of which have been signed to date, GreenYellow offers customers an innovative solution with an energy-saving guarantee without investment from the client and with net gains from the first year. GreenYellow installs energy efficient installations at a client’s site, the funding for which is fully compensated by the energy savings realized by the installations. These gains in efficiency are guaranteed over the length of the CPE by GreenYellow, which monitors the site’s energy consumption closely. - Purchasing energy and monitoring consumption: GreenYellow provides purchasing and monitoring services for over 7,000 points of consumption. GreenYellow continues to consolidate its leadership in the photovoltaic systems market. Its installed base includes projects with industrial customers and local authorities in France, Thailand, Colombia, Morocco and Brazil. GreenYellow continues to innovate in its international markets and notably completed a 6 MWp solar power plant on the rooftop of the South East Textile factory in Thailand and a 1.5 MWp project for Soma Energy in Cambodia. In the Indian Ocean region, where it is the leading solar power producer, GreenYellow signed a partnership agreement with Axian, Société Générale, GuarantCo and the African Guarantee Fund to support the funding of the largest solar power plant in Madagascar and accelerate the country’s green energy transition. In addition to the foregoing, GreenYellow has also expanded its operations to new businesses, including the sale of green energy to corporations in Brazil and direct-to-customer natural gas offerings through Cdiscount. GreenYellow’s offerings have also developed to include electric vehicle charging stations in partnership with both Allego to deploy France’s largest network of ultra-fast vehicle charging stations and Jedlix, a start-up which offers “smart charging” to automatically recharge electrical vehicles using reduced carbon dioxide emissions when energy is the cheapest. 184 ----- relevanC We created relevanC (formerly 3W.relevanC) in 2018 to leverage the large amounts of quality data about our customers and their buying habits in stores and online to which we have access as part of our food retail business operations and Cdiscount. RelevanC is focused on the production of studies on purchasing behavior, the implementation of targeted advertising campaigns offering tailored deals to customers and measuring the impact of these campaigns on in-store sales. In February 2020, relevanC merged with our subsidiary, Maxit, a “digital factory” that focused on technology innovation for our various banners, to offer retailers and brands customer acquisition and retention solutions, based on targeting strategies and impact measurement, through two key divisions: - _relevanC advertising, which offers clients media and marketing solutions, enhanced by transactional data, insights and measurements, to help clients meet the multi-channel marketing challenges with their target shoppers; and - _relevanC retail tech, which offers clients technological solutions to enable them to optimize the performance of their marketing campaigns through the use of data to personalize the customer relationship. Prior to merging with Maxit, in June 2019, 3W.relevanC entered into a partnership for digital direct advertising with Conforama, a European leader in home furnishing and building supplies. In 2019, relevanC was awarded the LSA Innovation Marketing Trophy by LSA for its partnership with Orange Advertising, which measured the impact of television advertising on customers’ buying habits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, relevanC generated net sales of €55 million, after the 3W de-merger. The relevanC advertising platform came fifth in SRI’s ranking based on gross sales under banner, versus seventh in 2019. During the quarter, relevanC signed its first contracts with external clients outside France. ScaleMax In 2018, as part of our asset monetization strategy, we entered into a strategic partnership with Qarnot computing to launch ScaleMax, a business that installs and operates new-generation data centers for clients in France seeking access to high-performance computing capacity that is both sustainable and secure and can be rapidly deployed on a large scale. In 2019, ScaleMax installed and began operating its first data center at a Cdiscount logistics warehouse in the Greater Paris region and has since secured contracts with a broad range of clients, including several banking clients, start-ups specialized in artificial intelligence and 3D animation studios. In 2020, ScaleMax continued its development through a series of strategic initiatives, including increased computation capacity through a new data center inside the Cdiscount warehouse in Verpilleux and the diversification of its customer base across various industries. Since its inception, ScaleMax has doubled its computing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, over 27,000 cores had already been deployed for customers other than Group entities. Real Estate Activities In addition to the active management of our own property portfolio (see “—Management of Real _Estate Portfolio” below), we also offer real estate ownership and management services through IGC_ (“Immobilière Groupe Casino”) that owns most of our property assets. In addition, we own a 20% stake in Mercialys, a public company that leases and manages shopping centers and city center retail space in France. As of December 31, 2020, the market value of the Group’s owned real estate portfolio in France was estimated to be approximately €1.3 billion, including transfer duties (and excluding our share of property held by Mercialys). As of that date, Mercialys managed 55 shopping centers and four other sites 185 ----- with a combined area of over 820,000 square meters. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Mercialys recorded revenue of €231 million. Casino Restauration Casino Restauration is one of our subsidiary companies that was historically positioned in the fastfood segment through its operation of a chain of fast food franchise cafeterias in France. In recent years, however, Casino Restauration has been repositioned through new concepts, including family restaurants such as À la Bonne Heure, themed restaurants such as Villa Plancha, take-away food, such as Coeur de Blé and events catering services such as its St Once business line. In 2019, we completed the sale of several Casino Restauration assets, including a number of R2C locations in June 2019, as well as À la Bonne Heure and Coeur de Blé locations at the end of 2019. Floa Bank Created in 2001, Floa Bank (previously Banque Casino) is a joint venture with French bank Crédit Mutuel CIC (“CM-CIC”), of which we own 50%, that provides consumer finance programs and insurance products to Cdiscount and Géant hypermarket customers. It has capitalized on our long-standing retail background and on the financial solidity of CM-CIC to become an online banking option for customers, providing them with a wide choice of credit cards, easy terms of payment, fully accessible on-line insurance and access to innovative fully digital banking, such as the 100% online mini-loan service Coup de Pouce in collaboration with Cdiscount or the 10-installment payment solution guaranteeing a reply in less than two minutes. It has also developed innovative solutions for e-tailers, providing them with custom-made services such as payment by installments, allowing customers to pay for goods online through a completely digital process in three or four separate installments. In addition to serving its individual banking customers, Floa Bank also provides bespoke services for fintech companies and is a key partner to tourism companies. In 2020, Floa Bank served 3 million customers and issued approximately €2.2 billion in loans. Floa Bank has become a leader in the French pay-later market, with approximately 25% of the market share and over 100 e-commerce merchant partners. _Latin America_ Our holdings in Latin America, which include both retail and non-retail businesses, are concentrated in four countries: Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina. The Latam Retail segment, which consolidates the Latin American operations, recorded net sales of €14,656 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Latin American sales rose by 17.3% on an organic basis in year 2020, driven by excellent performance of the Assaí banner. GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito carry out retail operations in Latin America through a network of 3,158 stores in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Uruguay as of December 31, 2020. GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito hold leadership and co-leadership positions in most of the Latin American markets in which they operate through banners with a long-standing presence and a close relationship with their customers. GPA, Assaí and Grupo Éxito have developed multiple store formats in Latin America, including hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash & carry, hard discount and convenience store formats. In 2019, we completed a project to simplify our structure in Latin America, thereby bringing all activities in the region under the umbrella of GPA, which now controls 96.6% of the capital of Grupo Éxito, which in turn controls the subsidiaries Libertad in Argentina and Grupo Disco in Uruguay. In 2021, we carried out a further step toward reorganizing our Brazilian operations with the spin-off of Assaí, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPA. We estimate that the market value of our stake in GPA, which represents 41.2% of GPA’s shares and voting rights, was approximately €0.4 billion as of March 8, 2021 186 ----- based on GPA’s share price of BRL 22.85 (€3.37 at the BRL/EUR spot FX rate of 6.7792). We estimate that the market value of our stake in Assaí, which represents 41.2% of Assaí’s shares and voting rights, was €1.2 billion as of March 8, 2021, based on Assaí’s share price of BRL 71.01 (€10.47 at the BRL/EUR spot rate of 6.7792). In connection with these transactions, GPA migrated its listing venue from the Level 1 segment to the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 – Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A in 2020, and, following the spin-off, Assaí became listed on the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 – Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A in March 2021, giving each company access to a wider international investor base and independent access to the capital markets and different financing sources. _Brazil_ Retail Businesses We have had a retail presence in Brazil since 1999 through our stake in GPA, over which we gained control in 2012. GPA is a long-standing leading player in the Brazilian food retail market, offering multiformat and multi-banner retail options to cater to customers from all socio-economic backgrounds in Brazil. As of December 31, 2020, GPA and Assaí operated 873 and 184 retail stores and service stations in Brazil, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, GPA and Assaí employed 55,931 and 48,885 employees in Brazil, respectively. Over the past few years, GPA has adapted its positioning to meet changing consumer needs, particularly through the development of the Assaí cash & carry banner that was previously its whollyowned subsidiary, which is Brazil’s second largest cash & carry banner, according to Euromonitor, and represented 55% of GPA’s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 51% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. On December 31, 2020, the general assembly of GPA approved the spin-off of Assaí. Assaí’s shares were listed on the B3 – Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. on March 1, 2021. The spin-off was done in an effort to recognize Assaí’s full potential on a standalone basis by focusing on business models and market opportunities that differ from those of GPA’s traditional retail businesses. This spin-off is expected to reduce corporate inefficiencies and allow GPA and Assaí to more efficiently allocate their capital, and the Latin American business is expected to benefit from this refocus of business units. A summary of the structure of our holdings both before and after the spin-off is below. GPA has also focused its efforts on the increased digitalization of its services for its customers in Brazil. In 2018, GPA partnered with Cheftime Comércio de Refeições Ltda., a Brazilian recipe delivery service, to offer Cheftime’s online gastronomic food solutions to its customers in its Pão de Açúcar stores. 187 ----- That same year, GPA also acquired James Delivery, a multiservice order and delivery platform, as part of its efforts to advance its online food retail channel. As of December 31, 2020, James Delivery was operating across 32 different cities. GPA has also strengthened its internal innovation initiatives through the creation of its own innovation lab, GPA Lab, located at its headquarters, in order to strengthen and reinforce a culture of innovation. In addition, GPA has expanded its click & collect delivery across its store network. In addition, GPA has also been developing innovative private-label goods to respond to changing consumer preferences, including Qualità, an umbrella for food products, and Taeq, a health and well-being range of products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GPA’s and Assaí’s operations together recorded consolidated net sales of €11,019 million. Following the spin-off of Assaí, the Brazilian business is now conducted through the Multivarejo banner of our subsidiary GPA, and the cash & carry business of our subsidiary Assaí. _Multivarejo_ Hypermarkets - _Extra Hypermarkets, which offer a wide range of food products and personal and household equipment to cater to all budgets through 103 retail stores.

Supermarkets - _Extra Super, a supermarket banner, offering comprehensive food offerings and non-food range products through 6 large supermarkets. GPA is converting its stores operating under this historical banner into one of two newer banners, Mercado Extra and Compre Bem; - _Mercado Extra, a supermarket banner created in 2018 aimed at creating a new identity for GPA’s supermarkets through an emphasis on fresh produce, more selective product offerings, competitive pricing and a new logistics system.

This self-service wholesaler with_ 184 stores offers a large range of food products and a small selection of non-food products at very low prices for both individual customers and small-and medium-size business customers. Through its loyalty program, Assaí offers its shoppers the Passaí card, which had a portfolio of more than 1.2 million customers at the end of 2020. In June 2019, GPA completed the strategic disposal of Via Varejo, a Brazilian electronic retail business, for a sale price of €615 million. The disposal of Via Varejo was part of GPA’s strategic program to dispose of nonperforming assets in Brazil in order to focus on the development of its food retail sector and cash & carry segment. Non-Retail Businesses In addition to its retail operations in Brazil, GPA also operates non-retail businesses, through its real estate and joint venture consumer finance solutions companies. _FIC. In 2004, GPA partnered with Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (“Itaú Unibanco”), one of the_ largest privately owned financial institutions in Brazil, to offer financial services at GPA’s retail store locations in Brazil as a means to foster customer loyalty and to increase in-store sales and profitability. Assaí has joined this partnership following its spin-off from GPA. FIC operates financial services kiosks in GPA’s and Assaí’s various stores with exclusive rights to offer credit cards, financial services and insurance policies (except for extended warranties) to their customers. FIC’s credit cards offer payment options for the cardholders at GPA’s and Assaí’s stores, aiming to provide them with benefits and convenience.

As of December 31, 2020, the market value of the Group’s owned real estate portfolio in France was estimated to be approximately €1.3 billion, including transfer duties (and excluding our share of property held by Mercialys), compared with €2.6 billion at the end of 2018, mainly due to disposals of real estate assets. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of Results—Changes in Consolidation Scope”._ Our integrated internal teams create value for our Group as well as for third parties that own the real estate assets where we operate our retail stores through research and design, strategic land purchases, delegated project management, property development and management, property letting, management of related legal affairs and asset value enhancement and management. In line with our focus on developing a less capital-intensive, more asset-light structure to preserve our operational flexibility, we are pursuing a model based on holding less property and developing more franchises. We also continue to create value for our portfolio by optimizing areas to expand on new business activities, such as through the conversion of certain real estate space for use by our e-commerce operations or to install our IT servers, and developing projects on our land in partnership with specialized real estate players for potential future sale.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.36,Suppliers & Logistics,18.36.1,,"We have a large network of suppliers and we believe that we provide an important channel for these suppliers to access customers. In 2020, our top 10 suppliers represented 11% of our cost of goods sold. We work with over 66,000 suppliers who supply us with both private-label and national brand products. Our supplier base is characterized by numerous stable, long-term relationships with suppliers from a wide variety of backgrounds, including suppliers of leading or national brands, suppliers of our private-label products, small-to-medium enterprises or cooperatives and farmers who supply our stores locally and suppliers of goods and services for general and administrative purposes. Typically, supplier contracts are renewed on a yearly basis. We select our suppliers based on strict specifications related to product quality. We do not believe that we are dependent on any one supplier or that the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business. 195 ----- We actively seek to maintain regular and constructive dialogue with our suppliers and have won awards for our supplier collaborations, including three Grés d’Or prizes rewarding our relations with smallto-medium enterprises in France. To limit the social and environmental impact of our purchases, we have circulated the Supplier Ethics Charter since 2011. This Charter specifies our expectations regarding freedom of association, which must be respected across the supply chain, by reaffirming our commitment to banning all illegal practices in business relations and requiring compliance with applicable laws and standards; upholding human rights and ensuring occupational health and safety; and taking constant care to protect the environment through the efficient use of natural resources and diligent waste management and pollution abatement. In 2020, 89% of all suppliers producing private-label products in at-risk countries have been audited by the Initiative for Compliance and Sustainability within the two prior years. In 2014, we signed an initial Corporate Social Responsibility agreement which affirmed the importance of encouraging suppliers to address CSR issues in their own supply chain and to promote their responsible products; the need to continue training buyers in the standards defined in the Supplier Ethics Charter and to take working conditions and environmental criteria into account when selecting suppliers; and the importance of auditing supplier production facilities in countries deemed at risk and assisting them, to the extent possible or necessary, in deploying corrective action plans. Our supply chains are organized at the country level and differ banner by banner. For example, in France, for our retail operations, our specialized subsidiary, Easydis, makes deliveries from 15 sites throughout the country representing approximately 630,000 square meters of warehousing. We also outsource certain of our logistics needs, such as transport and courier services, and enter into logistics partnerships designed to reduce supply chain costs. Our supply chain management information system, from our suppliers to our retail stores, is covered by an integrated information system. We use specific software to analyze the information we gather from our distribution network. We believe that the strength and quality of our logistics network is critical to the freshness of our products, quality control and customer satisfaction. We aim to optimize our logistics systems through automation, robotization, pooling of warehouses and partnerships with last mile delivery experts. We seek to reduce the environmental footprint of our supply chain by using alternative modes of transport. For example, Easydis is transitioning to 100% clean transport resources through the upgrade of its vehicle fleet with compressed natural gas-fueled, hybrid vehicles. Logistics is particularly crucial to the success of our retail and pure e-commerce businesses. Leveraging our partnership with Ocado, in March 2020, we completed the development of and began operating the automated Casino O’logistique warehouse, which provides a front-to-back online solution with the ability to offer customers next-day delivery of approximately 50,000 items with low preparation and delivery costs. The deployment of this warehouse has allowed us to significantly expand the delivery area through which customers can order Monoprix products and the speed at which they receive them. In addition, as of the end of 2019, Cdiscount has a network of 15 distribution centers in France with a combined total of 544,000 square meters spread across three main regions: Paris, Saint-Étienne and Bordeaux. To support its growing product assortment, a new warehouse of 80,000 square meters was opened near Paris (Moissy) in June 2018 and a new warehouse of 60,000 square meters was opened near Lyon in Andrézieux, France in July 2019. To efficiently process the large number of orders received, Cdiscount has automated and custom-designed its warehouse space, using 3D packing machines which allow the creation of customized packaging for each order, generating cost savings, and reducing cardboard usage with up to 30% less wasted space, and installing automated sorting systems to increase the speed of order processing. 196 ----- In Brazil, GPA operated 15 distribution centers and depots strategically located across the country, with a total storage capacity of 539,000 square meters as of December 31, 2020. Assaí operated 9 distribution centers with a total storage capacity of 136,000 square meters as of December 31, 2020. The locations of the distribution centers enable GPA to make frequent shipments to retail stores, which reduces the need for large in-store inventory spaces, and limits non-productive store inventories. GPA uses pd@net, a business-to-business technology platform, which links GPA’s computer-automated system to distribution centers and suppliers in order to automatically replenish retail store inventory.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.37,Quality Control,18.37.1,,"Product quality and safety are our top priorities. We have developed an end-to-end system from product specifications to store operations that ensures we sell safe, healthy products of the highest quality. Our international quality control system is deployed through a number of different channels, including through our centralized internal Group Quality department that is fully dedicated to monitoring and enforcing quality assurance and food safety standards and procedures, and managing any quality or food safety issue across our entire supply chain. The Group Quality department coordinates with subsidiary quality departments to share best practices and procedures in such areas as product quality and safety policies, traceability, supplier audits, crisis management and product withdrawal and recall. We perform regular on-side audits of production facilities, with emphasis of health and safety risks in compliance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point principles. In particular, our audits focus on the inspection of suppliers of private-label food products, our own warehouses to verify that best practice procedures and guidelines are being followed and our retail store locations in France. In addition, we conduct various product quality controls throughout the year, including several inspections of our private-label products by independent laboratories, microbiology analyses by our banners’ quality departments to manage any potentially serious health risks, sensory analyses conducted with customers to monitor taste, aroma and sensory characteristics of our products, and grading of produce and butcher meats in warehouses through approximately 320,000 annual inspections. Our French and Latin American operations are members of initiatives which set global benchmarks for food safety standards throughout the supply chain. For example, in 2019, we conducted more than 21,900 microbiology and almost 23,000 physiochemical tests in France to control food, household and health and beauty products. We sell high quality private-label food products and work to ensure the quality and safety of our products across every private-label product range. To that end, we have defined strict contractually binding specifications for every sourced private-label product which ensure that the supplier delivers a product that complies both with applicable legislation and the quality grade expected by the banners. These specifications consist of descriptive technical data, compliance statements and analysis reports. In addition to the foregoing systems that are deployed on an international level, our individual subsidiaries also develop and deploy their own quality control and product safety programs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.38,Information Systems,18.38.1,,"Our information systems are critical to our business operations. They provide management, analytical and performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake business processes. Our technical infrastructure and computer applications are also used for the day-to-day management of our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, loyalty program management, data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting, consolidation and electronic data 197 ----- interchange. Our business depends on the ability of our employees to process transactions on secure information systems and our capacity to store, retrieve, process and manage information. Our information systems are highly integrated, covering most of our fundamental business service areas. We have developed a target model based primarily on two well-known management software suites for administrative functions and sales functions. This model encompasses IT standards and governance frameworks to ensure that our information systems are geared to our current and future objectives. We have a dedicated department, the Group Information Systems Security Department, that ensures the security of our information systems by regularly assessing each unit’s information systems security, ensuring that action plans have been drawn up to address areas for improvement and leveraging synergies between information systems security departments to coordinate initiatives and ensure a consistent level of security across our lines of business. We believe that our information systems are robust, adequate to support our activities and operate at standards that are comparable to other operators in our industry.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Each of our banners has an organization dedicated to customer service functions. Our main banners have established loyalty programs (including digital programs) to improve customer satisfaction, monitor customer needs and allow customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future purchases. We continue to increase the digitalization of our loyalty programs with new features regularly added across all of our loyalty program mobile applications. Our loyalty programs are a key tool in giving loyal customers access to preferential offers tailored to their shopping habits. For example, the Éxito loyalty program had approximately 13.4 million members as of December 31, 2020 and is Colombia’s largest. Furthermore, Cdiscount’s à Volonté loyalty program had over 2.3 million members to date and provided its member customers free one-day shipping and other advantages such as free and unlimited online access to newspapers and magazines. Each of our banners has a customer service center that is open 24/7 by telephone, mail or the Internet where customers can obtain information on stores and products and have their questions answered. We also connect with our customers through dedicated applications, as well as our banners’ social networks, which allow customers to exchange directly with our stores and have their questions answered in real time, and through surveys and questionnaires that address a wide variety of issues that affect customer satisfaction, from store cleanliness and service quality to the range of products offered. For example, in Colombia, Éxito carries out approximately 100 customer surveys per store as well as online surveys. Marketing is an integral part of the promotion of our banners, stores and products. We carry out a number of branding and advertising initiatives through our stores, websites and mobile applications, and, to a lesser extent, through print and broadcast advertising campaigns. We develop integrated marketing campaigns specific to each store banner in which we operate that are structured and directed to the banner’s target consumer market. The Group is engaged in customizing its marketing efforts through the development of mobile applications like Casino Max in France, which enables customers to access customized coupons. 198 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.40,Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),18.40.1,,"Our corporate social and environmental responsibility is a top priority for our management and is viewed as a cornerstone of our further success. We have established a number of goals and initiatives through our CSR program to ensure responsible operations and to create a healthy and safe future for people and the environment. The key sustainable development goals of our CSR program include serving as (1) a responsible retailer, through sales of responsible and innovative products; (2) a trusted partner to our suppliers by supporting local production and promoting ethical compliance across our supply chain; (3) an environmentally, climate-aware group focused on reducing our environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy use and waste; (4) a local corporate citizen through solidarity partnerships and other programs; and (5) a committed employer, promoting diversity and growth opportunities for our employees. We have a longstanding commitment in favor of gender equality and diversity. In 2020, 52% of our 205,769 employees, and 40.4% of our Group-wide employees at the management level, were women, (reflecting a 5.4 percentage point increase compared to 2015). In addition, in 2020, more than 8,460 of our employees were classified as having a disability, representing an increase of 27% compared to 2015 (in Brazil, this figure represents an increase of 108% since 2015). We are also committed to diversity in age, with 49% of our workforce between 30 to 50 years old, 37% under the age of 30 years old and 14% were 50 years old and over in 2019. We believe we are the only French retail group that has been awarded the Equality and Diversity Label by the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR). Further, Our Board of Directors is strongly committed to diversity. Catherine Lucet, the lead independent Director, is also a member of the Audit Committee and Chair of the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee. There are no controlling shareholder representatives on any of our Board Committees. Further, 46% of our Board members are women. Our Board is strongly committed to its initiatives, as evidenced by the 10 meetings (97.9% attendance rate) and the 22 meetings of our committees (98.6% attendance rate) which took place in 2020. We are committed to developing and championing social initiatives that are beneficial for consumer health and our suppliers. Since 2005, we have focused on implementing policies to protect consumer health, including through improving the nutritional profile and ingredients of our private-label products, developing product ranges for specific nutritional requirements, conducting research into innovative products and production methods and promoting balanced eating. We offer a wide range of organic products across our private labels and dedicated organic and natural food store, Naturalia. For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales of organic products increased to approximately €1.3 billion (up by 12% as compared to the prior year). We are also committed to encouraging the development of the circular economy, for example through the launch of the Cdiscount Occasion platform for second-hand goods, and to combating food waste through our growing efforts to offer short-dated products at discounted prices. Moreover, we have pledged to label all of our Casino private-label food products with Nutri-Scores by 2021. As part of our CSR initiatives, we are focused on monitoring and improving the impacts of our supply chain by deploying processes to assess social, human and environmental risks across the supply chain, facilitating the development and implementation of our suppliers’ own CSR policies and supporting local producers. As a founding member of the Businesses for Human Rights Association in France, we strongly support cross-industry initiatives to identify and prevent risks in the areas of human rights violations, employee health and safety and serious damage to the environment. In 2020, more than 32,900 of our products were classified as environmentally conscious, such as products certified as organically farmed, organic cotton textile products, organic or eco-friendly hygiene and personal care products certified 199 ----- with the Ecocert in France, fair trade products as identified by a fair label and products with a certification attesting to their compliance with an environmental progress program (e.g., MSC, NF Environnement, FSC, PEFC, European Ecolabel). In addition, we have conducted over 895 audits of our private label suppliers in countries at risk to date. For many years now, we have been working closely with suppliers, local production chains and animal rights organizations in a commitment to offering products that are more respectful of animal welfare. To drive a cycle of continuous improvement, we cultivate dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including NGOs, veterinarians, suppliers, production chains, consumers and employees, in the hope that these initiatives will improve and broaden the array of animal-welfare friendly products on its store shelves and enable customers to enjoy better quality products made from more ethically treated animals. The chosen approach consists of both monitoring conditions in the breeding, transport and slaughtering process and supporting the production chains as they transition to better, more welfare-friendly practices. Our assertive commitment was recognized by the Business Benchmark on Animal Farm Welfare (BBFAW), which in 2019 rated our performance as Tier 3, at the top of French retailers on this issue. Consumer awareness plays a critical role in improving the treatment of farm animals, and to inform shoppers about the animal welfare aspects of the products they buy, we developed a labeling system in collaboration with three recognized animal rights organizations (including Compassion in World Farming), which will help to support standardized animal welfare labeling in France. The labels were initially prepared for broiler chickens, with the first labeled products appearing in stores in December 2018. At the beginning of 2020, the program was extended to other distributors and producers. Finally, we are committed to supporting the most vulnerable through our various charitable initiatives. In 2020, our collection and donation initiatives resulted in the donation of nearly 18,800 tons of food products (equivalent to 37.6 million meals) to food banks or other social welfare organizations. In Brazil, GPA deploys a number of annual initiatives, inviting clients to donate food and products to social institutions. In 2020, GPA donated 11,578 tons of food and products, including 993 tons of food collected on Solidarity Day, GPA’s yearly initiative with over 100 partner organizations. Through the Éxito Foundation, Grupo Éxito also supports numerous initiatives to fight malnutrition in Colombia. Our environmental initiatives are built on three key pillars: the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions in the fight against climate change, the preservation and conservation of resources in the fight against food waste and the preservation of biodiversity. Our environmental policy is supported by and implemented based on a number of internationally agreed-upon sustainability initiatives, including the objectives of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) and the Montreal Protocol, as well as the United Nations’ sustainable development goals, among others. In furtherance of these pillars, between 2015 and 2020, we successfully reduced our direct greenhouse gas emissions in France by 34%, as validated by Science Based Targets, and have established integrated action plans across our network to continue to reduce our emissions. In line with our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative, we have undertaken to reduce our Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 18% between 2015 and 2025, as well as our Scope 3 emissions by 10% between 2018 and 2025. We have also undertaken to reduce the amount of electricity used per square meter of retail space by 18% between 2015 and 2025. As of December 31, 2020, more than 500,000 square meters of solar panels were installed across all of our store roofs and parking facilities in France and Latin America. In partnership with GreenYellow, we are continuing to deploy energy performance contracts in many of our retail stores, the installation of which guarantees at least a 20% reduction in the baseline consumption of such stores. We are also committed to reducing and eventually eliminating disposal by dumping, aiming to create a circular economy by using end-of-life products a sources of new raw material. We have a target of using 100% of reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging for our Casino private-label products by 2025. Moreover, part of our commitment to offering sustainable food to our consumers is to ensure sustainably sourcing. In 2020, we have also 200 ----- achieved our target of sourcing 100% of the palm oil used in our French private-label products from sources certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil by 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Fixed-term contracts are used primarily to replace staff on leave or to support in-store teams during peak season periods. Trends in our business resulted in the hiring of more than 77,400 people on permanent or fixed-term contracts in 2020, which reflects a decrease of 30% over the prior year. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 84% of the total employees were employed full-time. Our Group employee turnover rate was approximately 24% in 2020. Our compensation policy takes into account each employee’s skills, level of responsibility and experience. We are committed to offering at least the legal minimum wage with fair, competitive compensation in line with market practices observed for each job and tailored to the specific local characteristics of each host country. We also offer variable compensation to most managers, supervisors and employees to encourage individual and group performance based on the fulfilment of quantitative and qualitative objectives. We regularly carry out surveys, mainly concerning management positions and other jobs that are difficult to fill, in order to assess the competitiveness of our compensation as compared with our peers. Every unit across our business in France has signed collective bargaining agreements with representative unions, covering issues such as working hours and compensation. We maintain regular dialogue with trade unions. There are currently more than 20 agreements and action plans in force in France, covering the employment of people with disabilities, gender equality, workplace health and safety, benefits and compensation and, more broadly, CSR topics in an agreement reaffirming our determination to integrate CSR into our business and human resources model. The implementation of these agreements is regularly monitored and their outcomes are presented to the representative trade unions every year. We believe we have good working relationships with our employees and their representatives and have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages. In each of the countries in which we operate, we have developed and implemented innovative human resources and management policies that are sensitive to local cultures. These policies are designed to foster the professional development of employees, enhance employee talents, combat discrimination, support equal opportunity, nurture constructive and innovative social dialogue, promote employee health, safety and well-being in the workplace and offer fair, progressive compensation and benefits. We are 201 ----- committed to promoting diversity in our hiring practices, helping young people enter the workforce, providing growth opportunities for employees and taking action to protect employees’ health and wellbeing. We are committed to providing career growth opportunities to our employees, who are the driving force behind our operating performance. We prioritize internal mobility in order to facilitate employee career development and ensure that we have adequate resources to meet our current and future needs. For example, we are committed to filling at least 50% of our management positions in France by promoting from within.

The DGCCRF claims that we demanded that these credits be given to us in an illicit manner outside the scope of our annual supply contracts and conditioned our future business relations on the grant of such credit. The DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned and the imposition of a fine of €2 million. On April 27, 2020, the Paris Commercial Court handed down its decision, dismissing most of the DGCCRF’s claims. The Paris Commercial Court considered that there was no evidence to support the vast majority of DGCCRF’s claims of unlawful behavior concerning 34 suppliers, but partially accepted a mere set of DGCCRF’s claims concerning the other seven suppliers. The Paris Commercial Court ordered the Group to refund a series of credit notes issued in 2013 and 2014 by the seven suppliers for a total of €2 million, and to pay a fine of €1 million. The Group maintains its position pursuant to which the Group acted in accordance with applicable regulations in its negotiations with the suppliers concerned.

The French Competition Authority did not pursue any further action in connection with the searches, and the investigation was officially closed in December 2020. Additionally, in February 2017, representatives of the European Commission carried out a search of the premises of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon Achats Marchandises Casino (“AMC”) and INCA-A, in connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers.

Parties can also provide for a longer term, but commercial leases rarely exceed 12 years because in such case, they must be drafted in the form of a notarial deed and must be registered (at some cost) with the French land registry. The lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease every three years, although this right can be waived by an agreement between the parties in certain limited cases (i.e., if the duration of the lease agreement is longer than twelve years or if the lease concerns premises used exclusively for office purposes, premises only used for a specific activity or premises used for storage activity). The lessor may only terminate the lease at the end of each three-year period in very limited circumstances, notably if it intends to build, rebuild or raise the height of the existing premises. 213 ----- At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to have the lease renewed.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.12,Labor Law,58.12.1,France,"_Minimum wages and social security contributions_ Under French law, the relationship between an employer and an employee is regulated by applicable legislation, the employment contract executed between both parties, as well as by the relevant national collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) and local CBAs (which also includes company-wide collective agreements). CBAs are agreements entered into between one or several trade union organizations representing employees, on the one hand, and an employer, or group of employers, on the other hand. The French Labor Code (Code du travail) and CBAs constitute important sources of obligations relating to working conditions for each industry they govern and relate to the individual and collective relationships between employers and employees. All national CBAs provide for minimum wages that vary according to the classification of the employee on the applicable pay scale. However, the wage of an employee cannot be below the minimum national wage set by the French government (salaire minimum interprofessionnel _de croissance or the “SMIC”), and for overtime hours, minimum wages and SMIC must be paid at an_ increased rate. Trade unions renegotiate the terms of the national CBAs almost every year, including the terms of any increase in the minimum wages for each specified level of employee. Annual wage negotiations also take place at the company level and the French government generally increases the SMIC every year. Companies to which such increases apply have an obligation to implement these provisions by granting at least a corresponding salary increase, failing which employees may bring legal claims for the enforcement of the relevant national CBA, back pay and damages. We are further required to pay contributions for our employees to social security and other social insurance schemes, which cover family allowances, illness, maternity leave, incapacity, retirement and death. Pursuant to the Fillon Law, Law No. 2008-1258, dated December 3, 2008 and amended on December 29, 2014, we benefit from reductions in certain contributions in respect of wages that amount to less than 160% of the SMIC. The amount of this reduction is limited to 26% of gross salary, and it increases in inverse proportion to the amount of gross salary (i.e., the reduction is lowest for a gross salary that is just under 160% of the statutory minimum wage, but highest for a gross salary that is equal to the statutory minimum wage). Pursuant to a January 2011 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary is calculated on a full-year basis (instead of the monthly statutory minimum wage, as it had been previously calculated) and pursuant to a January 2012 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary is deemed to include overtime, bonuses and supplementary working hours. Pursuant to Article 1609 quinvicies of the FTC, companies that are subject to the training tax and have at least 250 employees may also be subject to the payment of a supplementary training contribution if employees or trainees benefitting from specific training contracts (e.g., apprenticeship or professional training contract, volunteer for international experience program) represent less than 5% of the workforce (subject to certain exceptions). The rate of this supplementary training contribution depends in particular on the number of such employees or trainees working for the company. 218 ----- For compensation not subject to social security contributions (e.g., amounts paid pursuant to profitsharing agreements), employers must pay to the French tax authorities a flat social package, computed as a percentage of the compensation paid to employees. Within the context of the COVID-19-related special measures implemented by the French government, companies facing difficulties have been able to request the deferral of payment of their social security contributions by applying to the French social security authorities (URSSAF) without any penalties for late payment for the specified periods. _Working time_ French working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 35 hours. Overtime is paid according to an increased hourly rate, set out by national or local CBAs, or in the absence of such rate, by the French Labor Code. The number of overtime to be performed by an employee is limited to an annual contingent (“contingent d’heures supplémentaires”) provided by the CBA or the French Labour Code. The performance of overtime beyond such a contingent entitles the employee, in addition to the payment of these hours with an increased hourly rate, to a mandatory compensatory rest which duration depends on the headcount of the company (from 50% of the overtime performed beyond the contingent within companies with 20 or less employees, to 100% for other companies). An employer (both the company and its management) may be prosecuted for offences of “undeclared work” (travail _dissimulé) in connection with the failure to properly declare the time worked beyond 35 hours per week,_ which may result in fines, imprisonment, the loss of certain reductions in social security contributions and a prohibition on accessing public subsidies for employment, professional education and culture. As a result of undeclared work, an employer may also be liable to employees for the payment of a fixed penalty representing six months of salary, in the event of the termination of the employee’s contract. In addition, non-compliance with legal provisions regarding overtime may expose the company or its legal representative to additional fines. Moreover, because any compensation paid to an employee is subject to the payment of social security contributions, social security contributions related to overtime hours may be reassessed, which may result in the payment of additional social security contributions as well as additional charges for the late payment of contributions, penalties for late declarations and fines. The French Labor Code, however, provides for a certain degree of flexibility in applying the statutory weekly average working time of 35 hours per week for certain categories of employees. Supervisory employees who have a certain amount of discretion in determining when and how they carry out their work and for whom the working time cannot be predetermined and for whom the 35-hour weekly average may therefore not be suitable, may be subject to working time clauses providing for a fixed number of working days per year (forfait jour annuel) (a “per diem agreement”). Under French law, such clauses provided in the individual contracts of employment are implemented pursuant to the provisions of the applicable national CBA, local CBA or company-level collective agreement. The rules relating to minimum time off (a minimum of eleven consecutive hours per day of time off and a maximum of six days of work per week, with Sunday off as a general rule) remain applicable, however, to employees on per diem contracts. Employers must be certain, therefore, that tasks given to an employee paid on a per diem basis can be performed within the maximum work periods, minimum time-off periods and a reasonable workload, which must be monitored. If not, an employee working on a per diem basis can claim that his or her per diem employment contract is unenforceable and can assert a claim for overtime pay for the preceding three years and damages. Similarly, an employer may be subject to claims by employees for the payment of overtime corresponding to the hours worked that exceed 35 hours per week, if their per diem arrangements do not comply with applicable legal requirements. 219 ----- The provisions in the French Labor Code in relation to working time do not apply to senior management (cadres dirigeants). “Senior management” is understood to mean executives and managers (i) under employment contract, (ii) who participate in the management of the company with significant responsibilities, (iii) with a significant independence in the way their working time is organized, (iv) who are authorized to make decisions autonomously and (v) who receive compensation in the highest brackets of the employer’s compensation schemes. These criteria are cumulative. If a manager or executive believes that such criteria have not been met, he or she may assert a claim in court for payment, in the form of overtime pay, for any work performed beyond 35 hours per week, over the past three years and damages. Given the nature of our services, some of our employees at certain of our locations are required to work on Sundays, full day or at least in the morning. Under French law, the general rule is that Sunday should not be a work day. French law provides limited exceptions to this general rule, which may, as the case may be, permanent or temporary, be subject or not to authorization, applicable to the whole territory or to certain precisely delineated areas. The applicable provisions were last amended, in substance, by the “Macron Law” for growth, activity and equal economic opportunity (loi du 6 août 2015 pour la croissance, _l’activité et l’égalité des chances économiques) that extended the possibilities of opening shops on Sundays_ in the international tourist areas and commercial areas defined by the national or local authorities. In such case, a specific collective agreement must be negotiated with employee representatives, setting forth, among other things, the specific compensation granted to employees who work on Sundays. A specific authorization from the office of the Prefect is no longer required. French employees may work on Sundays only on a voluntary basis. We have negotiated collective agreements related to work on Sundays. _Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_ Under French law, an employer wishing to hire non-permanent workers may either (i) hire an employee under a fixed-term employment contract or (ii) engage temporary workers through an agency. French law only allows employers to use fixed-term employment contracts to perform specifically defined and temporary tasks in specific circumstances provided by law (such as to replace an employee on a temporary leave of absence or whose employment contract is suspended, to temporarily fill a position before an employee can be hired under a permanent employment contract or, after a permanent employee has left and before the position is eliminated, or for a temporary increase in the company’s business), which means that the task must necessarily have a temporary nature and cannot correspond to the regular activity of the company. Fixed-term employment contracts may also be put in place for seasonal jobs, which are subject to seasonal variations of activity. To be qualified as “seasonal”, variations in a business activity must be regular, predictable, cyclical and, in any case, independent from employers and employees. The Group puts in place numerous seasonal, fixed-term employment contracts, particularly to prepare for the holiday selling season. Fixed-term and temporary contracts are strictly regulated. A written contract is mandatory and a fixed-term contract must include certain provisions (such as the grounds for resorting to such a fixed-term contract) and be limited by time (i.e., a maximum of 18 months, reduced to 9 months or extended to 24 months in certain cases). Termination and renewal of such contracts are also subject to mandatory statutory conditions. If the employer does not comply with the mandatory provisions in respect of fixed-term employment contracts, employees may seek to recharacterize fixed-term contracts as indefinite term employment contracts, in which case the employer may be obligated to make certain additional payments (such as back pay) to employees, provide various indemnities, including in respect of unserved notice periods, make severance payments and pay damages for unfair dismissal. Non-compliance may result in fines and even, in the event of a repeated infringement, imprisonment. 220 ----- _El Khomri Law_ The “El Khomri Law” concerning work, modernizing employee dialog and safeguarding professional careers (loi n°2016-1099 du 8 août 2016 relative au travail, à la modernisation du dialogue _social et à la sécurisation des parcours professionnels), which impacts the Group, contains various_ employer-friendly measures and has been voted by the French Parliament in 2016. It provides that, among others: - In terms of working hours, local CBAs will prevail over national CBAs (with legal exceptions); - Since December 2016, the assessment of economic difficulties is based on legal criteria. Economic difficulties are defined as a significant change in at least one economic indicator, such as a decline in orders or turnover, operating losses, a deterioration of the relevant firm’s cash flow situation, a fall in gross operating profit, or any other element which could justify these difficulties. A decline in orders or turnover is assessed differently depending on the number of employees of the undertaking. A decline in orders or turnover is deemed to be significant when, compared to the same period in the preceding year, it continues for a period of at least: `o` one quarter, in an undertaking with less than 11 employees; `o` two quarters, in an undertaking with between eleven and 50 employees; `o` three quarters, in an undertaking with between 50 and 300 employees; or `o` four quarters, in an undertaking with 300 employees or more; and - The rules on validity and revision of collective agreements are modified. To be valid, local CBAs have to be signed by one or more trade unions who received more than 50% of votes cast, in the last professional elections (instead of the previous 30%). _Gender equality_ The French Labor Code provides for the obligation for companies with a union section (section _syndicale) to negotiate on a periodic basis about gender equality. Since March 1, 2019, for companies with_ at least 1,000 employees, and since September 1, 2019, for companies with over 250 employees, and as from March 1, 2020, for companies with at least 50 employees, shall also implement a 100-point index based on five criteria as follows: (i) gap in remuneration, (ii) gap in individual increases, (iii) gap in the career progression between men and women, (iv) percentage of employees whose remuneration has been increased at the end of their maternity leave and (v) number of persons whose gender is underrepresented within the 10 highest remunerations of the company. The distribution of the points between these categories is provided by the French Labor Code. If the company obtains less than 75 points after the application of the criteria, it shall adopt corrective measures to reach at least 75 points. The company shall publish the results of its index on its website. A company that does not publish such results or reach the threshold of 75 points, may be liable for the payment of a fine, which could amount up to 1% of the wage bill. _Employee representative bodies_ Pursuant to the French Labor Code, companies which headcount reached at least 11 employees during the 12 consecutive previous months shall set up a social and economic committee, which is the new combined employee representative body created by the September 22, 2017 ordinances (ordonnances 221 ----- _Macron), that replaces the staff delegates (délégués du personnel), works council (comité d’entreprise) and_ health and safety committee (comité d’hygiène, de sécurité et des conditions de travail). On January 1, 2020 at the latest, all the concerned companies shall have set up a social and economic committee. In companies with at least 50 employees, the committee has the same powers as the works council, the health and safety committee and the staff delegates (formerly employee representative bodies). _Trade unions and negotiation of local CBAs_ A trade union delegate (délégué syndical) or a representative of a trade union section (représentant _de la section syndicale) can be appointed within any company with a workforce of at least 50 employees_ (by exception, a staff delegate or a member of the social and economic committee can be appointed as a union delegate). There are currently five trade unions that are recognized by the French government as being representative of workers at a national level and, as such, are eligible to negotiate national collective bargaining agreements: _Force ouvrière (FO), Confédération générale du travail (CGT), Confédération _française de l’encadrement – Confédération générale des cadres (CFE-CGC), Confédération française démocratique du travail (CFDT) and Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens (CFTC)._ Representative trade unions may negotiate company and group-wide collective agreements. Since May 1, 2018, local CBAs must be approved by trade unions representing more than 50% of the votes cast during the last works council elections (as compared to 30% previously). Pursuant to the September 22, 2017 ordinance n°2017-1385, local CBAs can provide for less favorable provisions than those provided by national CBAs, except for certain specific matters (such as employee job classification, minimum wage and benefits, and fixed-term employment agreements). Labor market reform in general continues to be a key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda, and changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, we rely on our ability to negotiate or maintain in force certain collective agreements which provide us with the necessary flexibility in particular for working-time and Sunday work. Changes in, or the termination of, collective agreements may also substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. _Pacte law_ The “Pacte law” action plan for the growth and transformation of companies (Loi n° 2019-486 du _22 mai 2019 relative à la croissance et la transformation des entreprises) includes changes in labor law, in_ particular: - The simplification of social thresholds as from January 1, 2020: the law introduced (i) a unified mechanism for counting the number of employees, with the social security workforce becoming the reference (i.e. the average number of employees during each month of the previous calendar year), (ii) a rationalization of the levels of workforce thresholds by giving priority to the 11, 50 and 250 employee thresholds, (iii) a mechanism for smoothing the threshold effect following the crossing: the upward crossing of an employee threshold will only be taken into account when this threshold has been reached or exceeded for 5 consecutive calendar years, conversely, the downward crossing of an 222 ----- employee threshold will be taken into account when the downward threshold has been reached for a full calendar year. - Rules governing the allocation of profit-sharing reserves have changed as from January 1, 2020: - The remuneration taken into account to calculate the mandatory profit-sharing to be paid is limited to three times the annual social security contribution ceiling, rather than four times previously. - Regarding voluntary profit-sharing, the maximum amount that may be paid to a single beneficiary for a given year has increased from 50% to 75% of the annual social security contribution ceiling. - The presence of employees on the board of directors or supervisory boards, of companies or groups of companies with more than 1,000 employees in France or 5,000 employees in France and abroad has been strengthened with the appointment of at least two directors representing employees in companies whose number of directors is greater than eight (instead of 12) and at least one of it is less than or equal to eight (instead of twelve). The text also reinforces the respect of gender parity rules on the board of directors. _Social Security Financing Act for 2019_ To encourage the development of profit-sharing schemes, particularly in small and medium size companies, the 2019 Social Security Financing Act has abolished the employer’s flat contribution of 20% (“forfait social”) since January 1, 2019, as follows: On voluntary profit-sharing, for companies with less than 250 employees; On mandatory profit-sharing, for companies with less than 50 employees. _Specific measures related to COVID-19 pandemic_ Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, various temporary measures have been implemented in France to support companies, such as new rules relating to “partial activity”. A “partial activity scheme” allows the employer to reduce the working hours of employees and/or close down part of the company (one or more days in the week) in the following cases: - The company is affected by administrative orders mandating its closure; - The company faces a decrease in activity and/or difficulties in its supply chain; or - The company cannot implement the necessary preventive measures for the protection of its employees’ health (including remote work arrangements, investments in personal protective equipment and distancing measures). The loss of income suffered by employees as a result of hours not worked is partially compensated by the employer. The employer then receives a lump-sum compensation from the French state and an exemption from payment of social security contributions. 223 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,58,REGULATION,58.12,Labor Law,58.12.2,Brazil,"Employment relationships in Brazil are regulated primarily by the Brazilian Constitution, as updated by the labor reform, and the Consolidation of Labor Laws (“CLT”) through Decree No. 5,452 of May 1, 1943. _Collective bargaining agreements_ In Brazil, collective bargaining agreements relating to employment relationships prevail over individual contractual agreements so long as the terms of the collective bargaining are more beneficial to the employee than their employment contract. Nevertheless, the CLT provides for an exception wherein contractual terms of an individual employment agreement will supersede collective bargained conditions where the employee has individually negotiated their employment agreement and is a college graduate earning a threshold salary. _Minimum wages and social security contributions_ The Brazilian federal government adjusts the national minimum wage annually, however, each Brazilian state may establish their own minimum wage, so long as such wage is above the national wage. Both Brazilian employers and employees pay social security contributions. Individuals who receive compensation from a Brazilian employer are subject to the local social security tax, which is withheld by the employer or other source of income, as applicable. Individual social security contribution rates range from 8% to 11%, depending on individual salaries. Employers’ social security contributions generally range from 26.8% to 28.8%, calculated on the basis of each employee’s monthly salary. There is no cap on employers’ social security contributions. _Working time_ Brazilian working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 44 hours over a six-day period, with a cap of 10 hours per day. Employees who work in excess of this time period are required to receive a minimum additional 50% of their regular pay, which increases to 100% if work is performed on Sundays or holidays. This excess pay rate, as well as the limits to daily and weekly working hours, can be changed under collective labor agreements. _Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_ Brazilian law allows for temporary employment on the following conditions: the existence of a written contract (subject to specific requirements related to the duration of employment), an employer’s justification for their temporary need and an advance agreement as to salary. A company that wishes to extend the contract must make a formal request in advance to the Ministry of Labor, subject to the limitation that a temporary contract may not exceed six months. Generally, temporary contracts may only be used to render services to meet a specific demand for a specified time (such as seasonal holiday hires), for transitory company activities (as defined under Decree No. 10,060 of October 14, 2019) or as a probationary period for new hires during which time an employer can evaluate a new employee. 224 ----- _Gender equality_ The Brazilian constitution and the CLT provide for the protection of all employees, including as to matters relating to women’s participation in the labor market and their workplace rights. _Employee representative bodies_ Under Brazilian law, all employers and employees are represented by a labor union. A labor union’s classification (categoria sindical) depends on the (i) industry and (ii) location in which the employers and employees operate (e.g., a single city, multiple cities, a single state or multiple states). Each class of employers and class of employees is represented by one labor union in a given industry and geographic territory. All labor unions are required by law to have a collective bargaining agreement which must cover all participants of their applicable union class. _Trade unions and negotiation of local collective bargaining agreements_ Collective bargaining agreements in Brazil have the same status as the CLT and, consequently, employers must comply with all of their provisions. Failure by employers to comply with the collective bargaining agreement to which they are subject could subject them to contractual and administrative fines.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The current monthly minimum wage in Colombia is 828.116 pesos. _Working time_ Colombian working time regulations generally provide for a statutory weekly average working time of 48 hours per week, not to exceed 10 hours per day, for a maximum of six days per week. Employees may only work in excess of these limits upon the authorization from the Colombian Ministry of Labor. Employers are required to compensate employees at a rate of 35% higher than the employee’s regular rate of pay if they work over a threshold amount of hours during the day. This excess pay increases to 75% higher than the employee’s regular rate of pay if they work over a threshold amount of hours during the night. Employers are required to provide a minimum of 15 holidays per year, with Sundays and national holidays constituting mandatory rest periods. Employers are required to compensate employees at a rate of 75% higher than their regular rate of salary if they are required to work on a Sunday or holiday, in addition to ensuring that they have the right to an additional rest day. _Fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work_ Fixed-term agreements in Colombia are subject to restrictions in connection with their duration. For example, fixed-term agreements may not exceed a period of three years. To the extent such agreements provide a term of employment of less than one year, they can only be renewed for three equal or lesser terms. 225 ----- _Gender equality_ Colombia’s gender equality is rooted in its constitution, which recognizes women’s equality and outlaws gender-based discrimination. Employers are prohibited from any discriminatory action against their employees. _Employee representative bodies_ Trade unions in Colombia are particularly prevalent in certain industry sectors, including the sugar, railway, automotive, oil and mining sectors, as well as the public sector.

Pursuant to Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code, the Committee deals with matters relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information. It reviews the terms and conditions applicable to approving the financial statements, as well as the type, scope and outcome of the work undertaken by the statutory auditors for the Issuer and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, it is tasked with tracking the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and the audit of the financial statements of the Issuer and the Group by the statutory auditors, as well as the statutory auditors’ independence. To this end, the statutory auditors present their audit work and findings to the Committee. At least twice a year, the Audit Committee meets alone with the statutory auditors without any Issuer representatives. Additional meetings with the statutory auditors and with the internal audit manager may be arranged at the Committee’s request. The Committee also organizes the statutory auditor selection process. Since February 15, 2015, the Audit Committee has also reviewed all material agreements between the Issuer or its wholly-owned subsidiaries and related parties prior to their execution. The purpose of this review is to help prevent the risk of conflicts of interest and to protect minority shareholders. The Committee informs the senior management and the Board of Directors of its opinion on these agreements as to whether the transaction assessed falls within the scope of the related party procedure and fairly balances the interests of the Issuer and the related party. Further to changes in the legal provisions governing related-party agreements pursuant to the Pacte Law dated May 22, 2019 (Article L. 225-39, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code), the Audit 239 ----- Committee has also been responsible, since 12 December 2019, for reviewing agreements classified as arm’s length on a yearly basis and reporting its opinion to the Board of Directors. Each year, the Audit Committee reviews the report on arm’s length agreements entered into during the year or which continued to apply during the year, and the analysis of those agreements. The list of arm’s length agreements is accompanied by any supporting documentation, including reports prepared by a third-party expert in financial, legal, real estate or other fields, enabling the Audit Committee to review those agreements classified as at arm’s length and to report thereon to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee may also propose that an agreement initially considered as a related-party agreement be reclassified as an arm’s length agreement, if it deems appropriate. In that case, the Board of Directors discloses the change in its management report in order to inform the Issuer’s shareholders. The Audit Committee’s powers and duties, notably those concerning risk analysis and the detection and prevention of management errors, are set out in a charter. The charter was updated on March 13, 2019 and further updated on March 25, 2020. Its powers and duties are also described in the Board of Directors’ internal rules. _Appointments and Compensation Committee_ The Appointments and Compensation Committee is tasked with assisting the Board of Directors in reviewing (i) candidates for senior management and in selecting future Directors in line with the criteria and standards set by the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee to ensure, among other things, candidates’ sufficient complementarity of expertise and Board’s diversity, (ii) the human capital development and succession plan, (iii) the independence of Directors, (iv) corporate executive officer compensation, (v) the Issuer’s grants of stock options or free shares and (vi) the implementation of employee shareholder plans. The Appointments and Compensation Committee’s members are Nathalie Andrieux (independent Director), Laure Hauseux (independent Director) and David de Rothschild. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer participates in the Appointments and Compensation Committee’s selection and appointment process for Director and the Lead Director roles and its review of the Issuer’s non-corporate officer compensation policy for key executives. The role and responsibilities of the Appointments and Compensation Committee are set out in its charter, which was amended on March 13, 2019 to incorporate the Issuer’s practices and reflect changes to the Afep-Medef Code, which was itself revised in June 2018, and further amended on March 25, 2020 to take into account changes in the law in 2019. The Board of Directors’ internal rules, also amended, describe these responsibilities. _Governance and Social Responsibility Committee_ The Governance and Social Responsibility Committee monitors the development of governance rules, oversees their proper application and proposes any appropriate adjustments to such rules to align with the Issuer’s needs. In particular, the Committee is responsible for monitoring subjects relating to rules of ethics and conduct as applicable to Directors, including managing Board conflicts of interest, as well as determining the terms and conditions of, and conducting assessments of, the Board’s organization and functioning. The Committee also periodically reviews the Board of Directors’ structure, size and composition. The Governance and Social Responsibility Committee’s members are Catherine Lucet, Nathalie Andrieux, Christiane Féral-Schuhl, who are all independent Directors, and Frédéric Saint-Geours. The purpose and organizational rules governing the Committee are described in a specific charter that was amended and approved most recently by the Board of Directors on December 15, 2017. The Board of Directors’ internal rules also set out the Committee’s responsibilities. 240 ----- The scope of the Committee’s duties in the area of social responsibility was recently broadened to ensure the involvement of individuals at the highest level of the Issuer’s management in social responsibility issues. The Committee is thus responsible for reviewing the Issuer’s commitments and policies in the area of ethics, rules of conduct and corporate social, environmental and societal responsibility, and for implementing these policies and tracking their results in line with the Issuer’s social responsibility strategy. In this respect, together with the Audit Committee, it provides a framework to identify and manage the principal risks relating to these areas and compliance with applicable law and regulations. It reviews the Group’s participation in non-financial indices. It also reviews the information provided annually in the management report relating to non-financial information under applicable law and the Issuer’s gender parity policy, both of which were responsibilities previously entrusted to the Appointments and Compensation Committee. Furthermore, as mentioned under “—Governance” above, the Board of Directors recently agreed to give the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee, chaired by the Lead Director, the authority and responsibility to address issues related to the safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation is based on the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors ensures that the compensation policy is consistent with the Issuer’s corporate interests, the interests of its shareholders and stakeholders and the compensation policies applied to members of the Executive Committee and the Group’s employees. The total compensation paid to Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri by the Issuer, in respect of his role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer, amounted to €1,505,240 for the financial year ended December 31, 2019, consisting of fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, directors’ fees and including the additional compensation reflecting Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri’s critical contribution to the successful completion of strategic operations for the Group’s transformation and debt reduction in connection with the Asset Disposal Plan. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was not, and has never been, awarded any stock options, bonus shares or performance shares from the Issuer. He is expressly excluded from the list of beneficiaries of these types of compensation under the terms of the resolutions voted at the Extraordinary General Meetings of May 7, 2017, May 15, 2018 and June 17, 2020. At its meeting on March 25, 2020, the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee, set the principles and structure of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation for 2019, which was largely in line with the compensation approved the prior year. At their Annual General Meeting in May 19, 2019, the shareholders set the maximum total amount of directors’ fees to be allocated to the Directors and the members of the Board’s specialized Committees at €650,000. The method of allocating the directors’ fees as voted by the shareholders for 2019 (paid in 2020) between Directors and members of the Board’s specialized Committees was determined by the Board of Directors on March 25, 2020 based on the recommendations of the Appointments and Compensation Committee. The total directors’ fees paid in 2020 in respect of 2019 to the members of the Board of Directors and the Board’s specialized Committees amounted to €518,000, as compared to the €507,426 paid in 2019 in respect of 2018. Pursuant to the terms of our Articles of Association, each Director must own at least 100 shares of the Issuer. Our internal rules also state that each Director elected at an Annual General Meeting, whether a natural person, legal entity or permanent representative, also undertakes to hold a number of shares, the 241 ----- amount of which corresponds to at least one year of directors’ fees, with the possibility of using said directors’ fees to acquire such shares. Our executive compensation policy is designed to encourage and reward performance, both in terms of the Group’s results and on an individual level, and to ensure competitive compensation positioning relative to general market practices. Total compensation paid to members of our Executive Committee comprises a fixed and variable component. The variable component is contingent on the achievement of various objectives and can represent up to 50% of the fixed component if the objectives are met and up to 100% if they are exceeded. See Notes 8.3 and 8.4 to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. As employees, Executive Committee members may receive share grants as part of our policy to retain key people by giving them a stake in the Group’s development. Share grants are contingent on the achievement of performance conditions specific to the Issuer and on the beneficiary being employed by the Issuer on the vesting date. No stock option plans have been set up since April 29, 2010. The Issuer may also make one-off share grants to employees who have made a significant contribution to strategic or highly complex transactions. In 2019, 7 Executive Committee members were granted 190,487 bonus shares either contingent on a service requirement and performance conditions or on a one-off basis.

With respect to voting rights, Article 28-III of the Issuer’s Articles of Association stipulates as follows: - _“Shareholders hold as many votes as the shares he or she holds or represents, _without limitation, with the only exception of the cases provided for by law or in the Articles of Association._ - _However, a double voting right is assigned to all fully paid-up shares effectively _held in registered form in the name of the same shareholder for at least four years, as well as, in the event of a share capital increase via capitalization of reserves, profits, or issue premiums, to those registered shares granted free of charge to a shareholder in connection with old shares for which he or she is entitled to this right._ - _The double voting right is forfeited ipso jure for any share that was converted to _bearer-form or that was subject to a transfer of ownership except in the event of a transfer in which the shares remain in registered form, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225-124 of the French Commercial Code._ - _The vote or proxy issued by an intermediary that has either not declared itself as _an intermediary registered as a holder of securities on behalf of third parties not domiciled in France, or has not disclosed the identity of the owners of the shares_ 244 ----- _for which it is a registered intermediary, in accordance with regulations in force, will not be counted”._ Double voting rights may be withdrawn by decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting, after approval by a special meeting of holders of double voting rights.

Due to our legal and operational structure, all or some of our companies may also engage in business relations to provide services to each other. In addition, all or some of our companies may also engage in business relations with our parent companies and/or their subsidiaries. While the French Commercial Code provides for prior authorization of related party agreements, such authorization is intended to apply principally to agreements to which the Issuer is a direct party, and does not address the routine agreements our companies or our parent companies’ various subsidiaries may enter into in the ordinary course of our business operations. To address these intra-group transactions, and in order to prevent conflicts of interest which may arise from them, in 2015 the Issuer’s Board of Directors developed a procedure for the review of related party transactions by the Audit Committee. Following the Audit Committee’s recommendation, the Board of Directors approved a charter describing the Audit Committee’s related party transaction review procedures. The Board of Directors’ internal rules also reflect the Audit Committee’s role in related party transaction review. Pursuant to this procedure, prior to presentation for Board approval, the Audit Committee examines all agreements between the Issuer or its wholly owned subsidiaries and other companies in the Group, as well as controlling companies and companies accounted for by the equity method in our consolidated financial statements, where the value of the transaction in question, either individually or in total with other transactions between the same parties during the same fiscal year, exceeds €10 million. In addition, if the total value of the transactions between the parties within the same fiscal year exceeds €10 million, then the Audit Committee will review any additional transaction between the related parties that exceeds €1 million. The Audit Committee may rely on studies or reports produced by external specialist consultants in conducting its review. Following its review, the Audit Committee is required to provide an opinion as to whether the terms of the assessed transaction fairly balance the interests of both parties. This procedure does not apply to agreements between the Issuer and its wholly-owned subsidiaries or among the Issuer’s wholly-owned subsidiaries themselves to the extent such agreements concern routine ordinary course transaction, tax consolidation agreements (provided such agreements do not place one of the parties in a less favorable position than if it had been elected to be taxed on a standalone basis) or the issuance of a guarantee or a payment for a guarantee, provided such issuances are consistent with normal practices. Moreover, senior management may request the Audit Committee to review any other agreements that do not fall within the scope of the Audit Committee’s related party transaction review procedure 245 ----- thresholds. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Audit Committee may also request the Board of Directors to consider the creation of an ad hoc committee to review significant related party transactions. The Audit Committee issued a favorable opinion on all of the transactions it reviewed in 2020, concluding that their terms fairly balanced the interests of both parties, based on the reports of external experts. Each year, senior management presents a report to the Audit Committee detailing all related party agreements entered into during the prior year, as well as any transactions qualifying for the abovementioned exceptions to the Audit Committee’s procedures. Our related party transactions include our transactions with Euris, our ultimate holding company, and Mercialys. We receive strategic support from Euris, which in turn provides strategy and development consultancy services under an agreement signed in 2003 and the amendments thereto. On January 28, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the renewal of this agreement for three years according to the same terms and conditions and decided to reclassify it as an ordinary agreement concluded under normal conditions in view of the reports issued by financial and legal experts and the unanimous recommendation of the Audit Committee. We also receive other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris, consisting primarily of the provision of staff and premises. In 2020, we paid €4.7 million to Euris and Foncière Euris under these arrangements, under which €4.2 million was for strategic advisory services and €0.5 million was for the provision of staff and premises. We are also party to various agreements with Mercialys, including: - Leases — Casino leases units in certain shopping centers from Mercialys. Lease liabilities in favor of Mercialys for property assets amounted to €150 million as of December 31, 2020, of which €32 million is due within one year. - Property management agreement — Casino provides rental management services for nearly all Mercialys properties. As of December 31, 2020, the related management fees amounted to €5 million. - Partnership agreement — Under an agreement signed in 2012 and amended in 2014, Casino developed and managed a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquired to support the growth of its business. Per the amended agreement, Mercialys could propose new projects that Casino would examine and monitor through committee meetings. The partnership agreement expired at the end of 2020 and was not since renewed by either of the parties. - Support services agreement — Casino provides administrative, finance, accounting, real estate, and IT support services to Mercialys. As of December 31, 2020, the related fees amounted to €1 million. - Consulting services agreement — Casino offers the services of its team of real estate portfolio enhancement specialists to Mercialys. No services were provided under this agreement in 2020. - Sale mandate — Casino sought buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. This agreement expired at the end of 2020 and was not since renewed by either of the parties. 246 ----- - Current account agreement — Casino and Mercilays set up a shareholder current account for all eligible payments, withdrawals or advances of funds between the two companies. The agreement was amended and extended several times, with the latest addendum being signed in December 2020 and extending the maturity to December 31, 2022. The current cash advance limit under the agreement is €35 million, and no cash advances had been granted to Mercialys as of December 31, 2020. - Property development transactions — Certain property development transactions with Mercialys amounting to €116 million in revenue for Casino, and an EBITDA impact of €65 million as of December 31, 2020. In November 2020, the Group signed an agreement with Foncière Euris group to incorporate such group’s Krakow shopping center into its 2014 partnership agreement concerning the Serenada shopping mall. This agreement plans for a link-up between these two centers with the aim of creating a regional leader in the north of Krakow. In 2020, the Group committed to this new partnership by investing €13 million in two companies jointly controlled with the Foncière Euris group.

Each year, the Audit Committee reviews the report on arm’s length agreements entered into during the year or which continued to apply during the year, and the analysis of those agreements. The list of arm’s length agreements is accompanied by any supporting documentation, including reports prepared by a thirdparty expert in financial, legal, real estate or other fields, enabling the Audit Committee to review those agreements classified as at arm’s length and to report thereon to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee may ask for additional information from senior management of the Issuer. The Audit Committee may, if it deems necessary, propose that an agreement initially considered to be an arm’s length agreement be reclassified as a related-party agreement. Should the Board agree on the need for such a change, the rectification procedure referred to in Article L. 225-42, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code is implemented. The Audit Committee may also propose that an agreement initially considered as a related-party agreement be reclassified as an arm’s length agreement, if it deems appropriate. In that case, the Board of Directors discloses the change in its management report in order to inform the Issuer’s shareholders. In 2019, the Governance and Social Responsibility Committee recommended that the Audit Committee be tasked with reviewing the proposed renewal of the strategic advisory services agreement 247 ----- with Euris from January 1, 2020 (on the same financial terms and for a further period of three years) and its classification as an arm’s length agreement based on financial and legal assessments similar to those performed in 2017. In 2020, we paid €4.2 million for these services, excluding taxes. On January 28, 2020, the Board of Directors unanimously authorized the renewal of the agreement for a further three years and unanimously approved its reclassification as an arm’s length agreement based on the unanimous favorable opinion of the Audit Committee and the findings of the expert reports and legal opinions (the Directors concerned did not vote on either matter). The Audit Committee will review the arm’s length classification of the strategic advisory agreement with Euris on an annual basis in accordance with the review procedure drawn up on December 12, 2019. 248 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor (if any): - will be a general senior unsecured obligation of that Guarantor; - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Debt of that Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Debt of that Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Debt; and - will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of that Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Assuming we had completed the Transactions and applied the proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”, the total adjusted gross consolidated debt of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been €4,761 million as of December 31, 2020. The Indenture will permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur additional Debt in the future. 318 ----- The Issuer is a holding company. Its revenue is generated primarily from royalties received from its Subsidiaries for the use of trademarks and brands we own, as well as services billed to its Subsidiaries. Its material assets consist of certain trademarks and the equity interest it holds in its Subsidiaries. Payment of interest and repayment of principal under the Notes will be primarily dependent on the ability of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries to make cash available to the Issuer, through a combination of dividend and other distributions, interest payments under intercompany loans and cash pooling arrangements at the Issuer level. The Issuer’s Subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness or by law in their ability to, make such distributions or fulfill their obligations under intercompany loans to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes. Each of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from them. Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including the holders of the Notes. As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. Under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants— _Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries”, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain_ of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to any of the provisions of the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to: (a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been a resident, citizen or national of such jurisdiction or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business there or having or having had a permanent establishment therein for Tax purposes), but excluding any connection arising solely from the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or Guarantor to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that no Additional Amounts would have been payable had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note; (g) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof and any agreements (including any law implementing any such agreement or any intergovernmental agreements) entered into pursuant thereto; (h) any withholding or deduction required to be made by reason of the holder of the Notes or the beneficial owner of the Notes concurrently being a shareholder of the Issuer; or (i) any combination of items (a) through (h) above. In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and any Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holders of the Notes for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, enforcement or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other than a transfer of Notes other than the initial resale by the initial purchasers), or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (c) or (e) through (h) above or any combination thereof), or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Trustee or the Paying Agent, the Issuer or any Guarantors will provide to the Trustee or the Paying Agent such information as may be in the possession of the Issuer or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee or the Paying Agent to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder; provided, however, that in no event shall the Issuer or any Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably deems to be confidential. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Trustee be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.12,Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control,21.12.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs at any time, then the Issuer must make an offer (a “Change of Control _Offer”) to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or in integral multiples_ of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such holder’s Notes, at a purchase price (the “Change of Control Purchase _Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest_ and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control _Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant regular record dates that are prior to_ the Change of Control Purchase Date to receive interest due on an interest payment date). Purchases made under a Change of Control Offer will also be subject to other procedures set forth in the Indenture. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes in accordance with the Indenture and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice to each holder of the Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and _Notice”, stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Notes on the_ Change of Control Purchase Date, and the notice will state: (a) that a Change of Control has occurred, and the date it occurred and offering to purchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice; (b) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute a Change of Control; (c) the Change of Control Purchase Price and the Change of Control Purchase Date, which will be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations; (d) that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; (e) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest; and 326 ----- (f) any other procedures that a holder of the Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. An agent of the Issuer (expected to be the Paying Agent) will at the written direction of the Issuer promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of the Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Purchase Price for such Notes. The Trustee (or the authenticating agent appointed by it) will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Note or Notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of the Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated Notes; _provided_ that each new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control could trigger a mandatory repayment and cancellation of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement. Furthermore, the occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture could also constitute a change of control under the 2019 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the 2020 Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Other Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities or other Credit Facilities may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. The Issuer’s future indebtedness and the future indebtedness of its Subsidiaries may also require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer cannot provide any assurance that it will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. If the Issuer fails to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer or pay the Change of Control Purchase Price when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default”. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to Incur additional Debt are contained in the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt” and “—Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendments and Waivers”). Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the provisions of the Indenture will not require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer in the event of certain highly leveraged transactions, or certain other transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of 327 ----- Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including the “—Limitation on Debt” covenant. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control”, “Permitted Holder” and “Successor Parent” expressly permit certain third parties to obtain control of the Issuer without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer in any transaction which would require the making of such Change of Control Offer if it involved a person other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Successor Parent. For instance, if Rallye S.A., the Issuer’s controlling shareholder on the Issue Date, were to have, directly or indirectly, a new controlling shareholder, such event would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. “Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation or other similar business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any Person other than the Issuer, a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more Permitted Holders; or (b) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation or other similar business combination transaction) the result of which is that any “person” (as that term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date) other than one or more Permitted Holders, becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of the Issuer, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (b), no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the Issuer becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of the 328 ----- Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to a Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. While the Notes are held in certificated form, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of the Notes upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes redeemed. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

On a Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Period will be classified as having been Incurred pursuant to clause (2)(e)(A) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”.

(6) If on any date an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Debt of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Debt is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Restricted Subsidiary shall be in Default of this covenant). 335 ----- (7) In the event that an item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Debt described in clauses (2)(a) through (2)(u) of this covenant or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify items of Debt on the date of its Incurrence and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Debt in one of such clauses or paragraphs, and the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Debt in more than one of the types of Debt described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this covenant, and may change the classification of an item of Debt (or any portion thereof) to any other type of Debt described in this “—Limitation on Debt” covenant at any time; provided that (i) all Debt Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Other Existing Syndicated Credit Facilities and the Segisor Credit Facility and, in each case, any Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred as such in respect thereof, will be deemed to have been Incurred in reliance on the exception provided in clause (2)(a) above and may not be reclassified and (ii) all Debt Incurred pursuant to clause (2)(c) and clause (2)(u) may not be reclassified.

The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons who may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The BookEntry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest.

Under certain conditions, any such nondeductible interest and other assimilated revenue may be recharacterized as deemed dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC, in which case such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC at a rate of (i) 75% if they are paid outside France in a Non-Cooperative State, unless such Non-Cooperative State is referred to in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2° of the FTC, (ii) the standard income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the FTC (i.e., 26.5% for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021) if they are paid to non-French tax resident corporate or other legal entities (it being noted that such withholding tax rate will be reduced to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) or (iii) 12.8% in cases where the holder is a non-French tax resident individual, in each case subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A-III of the FTC nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non-deductibility set out under Article 238 A of the FTC and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC that may be levied as a result of such non-deductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of Notes, if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of such issue were not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). In addition, pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French administrative guidelines) referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20-24/02/2021 no. 290 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-3024/02/2021 no. 150, an issue of Notes benefits from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the main purpose and effect of such issue of Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from the Exception (the “Safe Harbor”), if such Notes are: - offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) which is not exempt from the obligation to publish a prospectus or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State which is not a Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative 405 ----- State, and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) entered into force on June 26, 2017 and is applicable to insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date, replacing Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (which continues to apply to insolvency proceedings opened prior to June 26, 2017). The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the centre of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency 407 ----- Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the threemonth period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the threemonth period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. 408 ----- The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: - for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and courts; 409 ----- - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new and interim financing and other restructuring related transactions and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 1, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. 410 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

To the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an establishment in France or (ii), in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or main center of interest within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, _sauvegarde accélérée_ or _sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire). Pursuant to Article L. 721-8 of the French Commercial Code, specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes. This is even more relevant within the temporary framework to amend Book VI of the French Commercial Code enacted by the French government in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Once transposed into French law, the EU Restructuring Directive should have a material impact on French insolvency law, particularly with regard to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under insolvency proceedings. According to this directive, “affected parties” (i.e., including notably creditors and therefore the Noteholders) shall be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. Classes shall be formed in such a way that each class comprises claims or interests with rights that reflect a sufficient commonality of interest based on verifiable criteria. As a minimum, secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. A restructuring plan shall be deemed to be adopted by affected parties, provided_ that a majority in amount of their claims or interests is obtained in each and every class (the required majorities shall be laid down by Member States at not higher than 75% in the amount of claims or interests in each class, it being noted that Member States may require that in addition, a majority in number of affected parties be obtained in each class). If the restructuring plan is not approved by each and every class of affected parties, the plan may however be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority by applying a cross-class cram-down, providing notably that: - creditors that share enough commonality of interest within a class benefit from equality of treatment and are treated in proportion to their claim; - the plan has been notified to all affected parties; - the plan complies with the best interest of creditors test (i.e., no dissenting creditor would be worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or sale as a going concern or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not to be confirmed); - as the case may be, any new financing necessary to implement the restructuring plan does not unfairly prejudice the interest of creditors; - the plan has a reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor or ensuring the viability of the business; - the plan has been approved: - by a majority of the voting classes of affected parties, provided that at least one of those classes is a secured creditors class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class; or, failing that, - by at least one of the voting classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law, impaired parties, other than an equity-holders class or any other class which, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going-concern, would not receive any payment or keep any interest, or, where so provided under national law, which could be reasonably presumed not to receive any payment or keep any interest, if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied under national law; it is specified that member states may increase the minimum number of voting classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law, of impaired parties; - the plan complies with the relative priority rule (i.e., dissenting voting classes of affected creditors are treated at least as favorably as any other class of the same rank and more 412 ----- favorably than any junior class). By way of derogation, Member States may instead provide that the plan shall comply with the absolute priority rule (i.e., a dissenting voting class of creditors must be satisfied in full before a more junior class may receive any distribution or keep any interest under the restructuring plan); and - no class of affected parties can, under the restructuring plan, receive or keep more than the full amount of its claims or interests. Member States may maintain or introduce provisions derogating from the conditions above where they are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and where the restructuring plan does not unfairly prejudice the rights or interests of any affected parties.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

If a company is incorporated as a societé anonyme, when there are elements which the statutory auditor of the company believes place the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, he or she must request company management to provide an explanation for the situation (Stage 1 of the warning procedure). Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures by management, the statutory auditor must request that the board of directors (or the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by the president of the relevant commercial court (Stage 2 of the 413 ----- warning procedure). The minutes of the board of directors’ meeting are sent to the employee representatives during Stage 2, as Stage 1 proceedings are confidential. If, despite of the statutory auditor’s request, the board of directors (or an equivalent body) has not been convened, if the statutory auditor has not been summoned to the meeting of the board, or if the statutory auditor concludes that in the context of this meeting satisfactory explanations have not been given and appropriate corrective measures have not been not taken by management, then management must convene a shareholders’ meeting at which the auditors present a special report on the state of the company. This report is also sent to the employee representatives (Stage 3 of the warning procedure). In practice, the statutory auditor commonly invites the management to convene a shareholders’ meeting. If management fails to act, then the statutory auditor convenes the shareholders’ meeting himself/herself and sets the agenda. If the statutory auditor considers that decisions made by the shareholders during the shareholders’ meeting do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, he or she must inform the president of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may also request to be heard on the matter (Stage 4 of the warning procedure). Similar warning procedures exist for companies not registered as a societé anonyme, with minor differences in technical details of the procedure. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence, the employees’ representatives have similar rights. The president of the relevant commercial court can also summon the management to provide explanations on elements which he or she believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy, or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his injunction. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health state of emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020 and Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 have amended the warning procedure to provide that, until and including December 31, 2021, if the statutory auditor considers the state of the relevant company to require immediate action, and has determined that the director is refusing to take such action or is taking insufficient measures, the statutory auditors may inform the president of the relevant commercial court concurrently with his or her initial report made to the director, the chairman of the board of directors (conseil d’administration) or of the supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be. In such case, the statutory auditor may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of the court his or her findings and proceedings, and may produce copies of any relevant documents.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision 414 ----- that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings.

In_ practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see – “Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the order of the President of the court appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. _Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_ difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or _liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above) provided _that a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its_ 415 ----- decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliateur if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and taking into account the conditions in respect of the execution of the conciliation agreement. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the commercial court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the commercial court at the request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the social and economic committee (previously known as works council) or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the existence of the proceedings, the amount of any New Money Lien (as defined below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the performance of the conciliation agreement, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.5,"Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization",62.5.1,Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard,"A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, _provided that_ it is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). When the situation of the debtor does not show difficulties that it cannot overcome, the court will first invite the debtor to petition the president of the court for the opening of conciliation proceedings (see “—Court-assisted Proceedings” above). The court will then rule on the sole request for the opening of safeguard proceedings. Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur 418 ----- _judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not_ necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the courtappointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de _sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the_ proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise _ex post facto_ control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de _cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed_ administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end, or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: - the court may decide on the conversion at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, except in the case of (i)(b), as described below; - the court may also act upon its own initiative, except in the case of (i)(b), as described below; and - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (“contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any). In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant creditors’ committees and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances. As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that: - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 provides for a new safeguard or reorganization privilege (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 21, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R 419 ----- Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period; - the S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person; - during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge, or - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, _i.e., within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the decision endorsing or modifying the plan must mention all claims benefiting from the lien, as well as the relevant amounts. - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims except with respect to (i) wages claims benefitting from the employees’ super-priority lien, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) claims benefitting from a New Money Lien, (iv) pre-petition claims secured by a real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and (v) post-petition wages claims not advanced by the French wages guarantee fund in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and - such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors for which the constitution of creditors’_ committees is not mandatory (as described below) unless, upon their or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the bankruptcy judge, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the courtappointed creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the proposed debt settlement provided under the draft plan. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, 420 ----- provided that_ it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the courtappointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (contrôleur). Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan _de sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_ that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, whose accounts are certified by a_ statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the supervising judge in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors committees that are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors or assignees of a claim acquired from a supplier) (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major **suppliers** **committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders **general** **meeting”), in which all such holders are to 421 ----- take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those _obligations._ As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or bondholders general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee or the bondholders general meeting. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, _inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-forequity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan._ The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervising judge at the request of the debtor or the courtappointed administrator, but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders’ general meeting in 422 ----- accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the courtappointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that_ they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholders meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case – Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations,_ social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de _Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect_ taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated 20 May 2020 and Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated 25 November 2020 have amended safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings as follows: 1. Until 31 December 2021 (included), on the basis of the certificate drawn up by a certified accountant or the statutory auditor, liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall include those claims admitted and not challenged as well as those “identifiable” claims (in particular when the deadline for filing proofs of claim has not expired yet): This includes liabilities foreseeable and reasonably likely to enable the Court to assess the seriousness of the plan (which requires that the debtor’s accounts be accurate, and that 423 ----- identifiable claims be taken into account, such as those of the French wages guarantee fund); This implies a temporary exception to the principle (established in case law) according to which the plan must be drawn up in consideration of the filed claims (even if they are challenged); 2. Until 31 December 2021 (included), upon request of the judicial administrator (if appointed) or the creditors’ representative, the bankruptcy judge may shorten the deadline for individual consultation of the creditors from 30 to 15 days. 3. Until 31 December 2021 (included), proposals for the settlement of liabilities included in the plan and any responses to these proposals may be notified by any means allowing the creditor’s representative to establish with certainty the date of their receipt, both in the context of the individual consultation of creditors and the consultation of bondholders within the framework of the bondholder’s general meeting (it is unclear whether this way of notification also apply to credit and credit institutions or assimilated institutions’ committee and main suppliers’ committee). 4. The duration of Safeguard and reorganization plans has been amended as follows: (i) Until 31 December 2021 (included): in addition to (i): extension for a further twoyear period upon request of the public prosecutor or the court-appointed trustee in charge of supervising the execution of the plan. (ii) Until 31 December 2021 (included): in case of substantial modification of the plan, its duration is extended to a maximum period of 12 years. With respect to (i) above, it should be specified that this extension does not require going through the process of substantial modification of the plan (modification substantielle du plan), as the payment instalment deadlines initially set are adapted by the president of the court or the whole court extending through the duration of the plan, with possible deviation from the obligation to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3 and possible application of grace periods provisions (see above “Grace _Periods”) within the limit of the new term of the plan so extended._ 5. Until 31 December 2021 (included), as part of a substantial modification of the plan process, where the modification is relating to the plan’s repayment terms and conditions, those creditors failing to reply to the registered letter provided for in Article R. 626-45 of the French commercial code will be deemed to have accepted the proposed modifications, except in case of debt write-offs or conversions into shares that give or may give access to share capital.

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those: 424 ----- - that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or - whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and who have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million. However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 provides that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 21, 2020 and December 31, 2021 If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions committee and bondholders general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan _de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde_ 425 ----- _financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions committee or the major_ suppliers committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as described above (see “—committee-based consultation”)), to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the court has decided to extend the initial one month period). In particular, the creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of it being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in the committee-based consultation of standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt write-offs and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 provides that for proceedings commenced between May 21, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial _Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the 426 ----- creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers (contrôleurs), the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers (contrôleurs), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan, with the contribution of the debtor), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire), the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers (“contrôleurs”) (if any), the_ public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de _l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the_ observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France – Court_administered Proceedings – Safeguard”). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 427 ----- employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a trustee (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will generally apply); and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. 428 ----- As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchasers can, under certain conditions, cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is offered at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets acting as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; and - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of the pledges over shares, but not mortgagees of real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). 429 ----- The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received_ from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. _The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings_ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. - Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as guarantee or as a precautionary measure in accordance with article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration _d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code._ Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) are also voidable when entered into during the sixmonth period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. 430 ----- There is, in theory, no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (assuming the proceedings are successful).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation _of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the_ opening of judicial reorganization proceedings”_ (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default (including in payment default), but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the sale plan (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), _provided_ that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the court-appointed trustee in charge of 431 ----- supervising the execution of the plan or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings (during the observation period only with respect to judicial reorganization proceedings)) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is; - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset, whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union at the time of the opening of the insolvency proceedings, in which case the rights in _rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced_ in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (provided no secondary proceedings are commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan (“plan de sauvegarde”) adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”). In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des _annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside_ metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees do 432 ----- not need to file a proof of claim in respect of their wage-related claims and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees (for the super-privileged part of their claims), post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), postcommencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this order of priority which, for example does not apply to creditors benefiting from an enforceable retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, article L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the 433 ----- debtor, such creditor being deemed de facto manager may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and upon the sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated      , 2021, the Issuer has agreed to sell the Notes to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase the Notes from the Issuer. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 30 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each Manager has agreed that, except as permitted by the Purchase Agreement, it will not offer or sell the Notes (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Notes during the distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have represented, warranted and agreed that they have: - only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issue or sale 435 ----- of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and - complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by them in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information About this Offering Memorandum “ and “Notice to Investors”. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We intend to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit them for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof; however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A Distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer in accordance with MiFID II, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will 436 ----- develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. The Stabilizing Manager, on behalf of the Initial Purchasers, may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited”._ These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, real estate assets valuation, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates (including our controlling shareholders) for which the Initial Purchasers have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders to our controlling shareholders, the companies Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris, as well as certain subsidiaries of the Issuer. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers were appointed as dealer-managers with respect to a tender offer for certain of Rallye’s outstanding indebtedness. Certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders under our Existing Term Loan B Facility and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering as a result of the repayment and cancellation of our Existing Term Loan B Facility as described in “Use of Proceeds”. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer 437 ----- or its respective affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are among the mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Existing Term Loan B Facility Agreement, the New Term Loan B Facility Agreement and the Monoprix Existing Syndicated Credit Facility. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers have provided other advisory services to the Group, including in relation to the Asset Disposal Plan. Jean-Charles Naouri, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer, is a former member of the board of directors of Natixis. 438 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions as defined in, and in reliance on, Regulation S under the Securities Act. We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act. You, by your acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows: 1. You understand that the Notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving any public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and that (i) if in the future you decide to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any of the Notes, such Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, and that (ii) you will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser of the Notes from you of the resale restrictions referred to in (i) above. 2.

The main standards and interpretations concerned are IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 6, IFRS 14, IAS 1, IAS 8, IAS 34, IAS 37, IAS 38, IFRIC 12, IFRIC 19, IFRIC 20, IFRIC 22 and SIC-32. - _Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis. They clarify the definition of a business and the application guidance for the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a group of assets rather than a business. Under the amended definition, to be considered a business, the integrated set of activities and assets must create output in the form of goods and services delivered to customers, rather than being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members or participants. In addition, an optional concentration test has been introduced to simplify the assessment of whether an integrated set of activities and assets is a group of assets and not a business. - _Amendment to IFRS 16 – Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions This amendment is applicable on a retrospective basis as from 1 June 2020 at the latest for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2020 ----- The amendment offers a practical expedient available for a limited period, under which lessees can choose not to apply IFRS 16 lease modification principles and instead account for rent concessions as though they were not lease modifications. This expedient is available for all Covid-19-related rent concessions that result in a reduction in lease payments originally due on or before 30 June 2021.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.63,1.3.2** **Impact of the first-time application of the IFRS IC decision on IFRS 16 – Leases,28.63.1,,"On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC published its decision on (i) determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease or a lease that can be terminated by either of the parties with no contractual penalty, and (ii) the link between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. This decision provides clarifications that may impact the term of leases other than the particular cases mentioned. The French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des Normes Comptables – ANC) issued a new position statement regarding “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France in its 3 July 2020 statement of conclusions, superseding its previous position statement of 16 February 2018. The ANC confirms that: - the initial lease term to be adopted is generally nine years. This period can be reduced to the contractual noncancellable period of three or six years, at the lessee’s discretion. The lease term may also be longer if provided for in the lease contract; - an automatically renewable period may also be taken into account in determining the initial term of the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain that it will renew the lease and/or the lessor cannot terminate the lease without incurring a significant penalty; any such period represents an extension of the initial term of the lease; - if an automatically renewable period is not taken into account when determining the initial term of the lease, the lease term is to be re-estimated and the initial amount of the right-of-use asset and lease liability is modified to reflect the additional period during which the lessee is reasonably certain to continue the lease; - the assumptions used to determine the lease term must be consistent with those used to determine the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements. The Group has finished analysing its leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected by this decision. Based on its analyses, the Group revised upwards the term of the following leases: ‐ automatically renewable leases or leases that can be terminated at any time; ‐ underlying assets under lease (stores, warehouses), including non-removable leasehold improvements, whose residual net carrying amount at the end of the lease term as estimated under IFRS 16 could give rise to a significant penalty (within the meaning of the IFRS IC decision) for the Group. #### Note 2 Significant events of the year Significant events of the year are the following:",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

As an essential industry, the Group’s banners were able to continue operating during the unprecedented health crisis and ramped up efforts to continue supplying customers in the best possible conditions. All of the Group’s sites worldwide were affected by Covid-19 and by the measures taken by governments to curb the spread of the virus. Covid-19 had a significant impact on our operations: we were required to reduce the number of customers in our stores at any one time, shorten the operating hours of certain stores in line with government guidelines and measures, invest in protective and other safety equipment, accelerate the deployment of self-service checkouts, increase our home delivery capabilities and our click & collect service, stockpile consumer staples and transition to remote working for head office functions. Many safety requirements that had been initially introduced by governments in the different regions in which we operate were reintroduced as from the autumn in response to the growing number of infections in various countries. The tighter restrictions followed a relaxation in the strict containment measures that had been imposed from the start of the pandemic through to summer 2020. In first-half 2020, the Group recorded strong growth in net sales, as well as additional costs related to maintaining its operations under challenging conditions. These additional temporary costs fell sharply in the second half of the year. Since the third quarter, our entire organisation has adapted to the various Covid-19 restrictions with minimal additional cost. However, the long-term impact of Covid-19 on inputs such as household spending, gross domestic product and exchange rates is not yet known. If the pandemic continues to spread, it could further (i) reduce our customers’ purchasing power, (ii) reduce the number of tourists who generally contribute to revenues for certain stores in the summer months, (iii) harm our operations by disrupting or delaying the preparation or delivery of products in our stores, (iv) affect the availability and cost of transport, (v) impact the financial stability of our suppliers and franchisees, and (vi) affect the value of our real estate assets Although we have observed a sharp rise in the volume of home deliveries click & collect and drive & collect ----- purchases, and despite having adapted our distribution networks to meet this upsurge in demand, we cannot predict whether Covid-19 (including future waves of the virus) will have a long-term impact on consumers’ purchasing behaviour and how this could affect our business strategies and future outlook. The assumptions and estimates used as a basis for certain statement of financial position and income statement items were reviewed in order to take account of the crisis. The assumptions and estimates reviewed mainly concerned the value of goodwill and other intangible assets; the fair value measurement of certain assets, particularly those classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5; financial asset impairment; derivatives hedging sales transactions; and deferred tax assets arising on tax losses.

The aim of this operation was to optimise Assaí’s potential on the one hand, and the potential of GPA and Éxito’s more traditional food retailing business on the other. The operation will enable them to operate autonomously and to focus on their respective business models and market opportunities. They will benefit from direct access to the capital markets and to different financing sources, thereby creating more value for their shareholders.

It redeemed its unsecured bond issues on the financial markets and launched two public buyback offers in November and December 2020. In all, the redemptions represented a nominal amount of €1,400 million, of which €467 million was due to mature in May 2021, €122 million in June 2022, €448 million in January 2023, €289 million in March 2024, and €74 million in February 2025. The December 2020 buyback offer was accompanied by two new sources of financing: - issue of €400 million worth of unsecured bonds, paying a coupon of 6.625% and maturing in January 2026. These new bonds include the same dividend restrictions as the financing raised in November 2019, i.e., dividends may only be freely paid out if the gross leverage ratio is less than 3.5x following the payout; - Term Loan B tap of €225 million maturing in January 2024, at an issue price representing 99.75% of the nominal amount.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.69,Accounting principles,28.69.1,,"Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all material subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over which the parent company exercises control, joint control or significant influence, either directly or indirectly (see list of consolidated companies in Note 17). SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group (i) has power over the entity, (ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date when control is acquired to the date at which the Group no longer exercises control. All controlled companies are fully consolidated in the Group’s statement of financial position, regardless of the percentage interest held. POTENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS Control is assessed by taking potential voting rights into account, but only if they are substantive; that is, if the entity has the practical ability to exercise its rights with respect to the exercise price, date and terms. The Group may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible into ordinary shares or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give the Group voting power or reduce another party’s voting power over the financial and operational policies of an entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group has control of another entity. Potential voting rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the occurrence of a future event. JOINT VENTURES A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that exercise joint control over an entity have rights to its net assets. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control over an entity, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. ASSOCIATES Associates are companies in which the Group exercises significant influence over financial and operational policies without having control. They are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING The equity method provides that an investment in an associate or a joint venture be recognised initially at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted by the Group’s share in profit or loss and, where appropriate, in other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Goodwill related to these entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any impairment losses and gains or losses on disposal of investments in equity-accounted entities are recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses"". Profits/losses from internal acquisitions or disposals with equity-accounted associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s percentage interest in these companies. In the absence of any guidance in IFRS concerning cases where the amount to be eliminated is greater than the carrying amount of the investment in the equity-accounted company, the Group has elected to cap the amount eliminated from the accounts in the transaction year and to deduct the uneliminated portion from its share of the equity-accounted company’s profits in subsequent years. The Group follows a transparent approach to accounting for associates under the equity method and takes into account, if relevant, its final percentage interest in the associate for the purpose of determining the proportion of profit (loss) to be eliminated. In the absence of any standard or interpretation covering dilution of the Group’s interest in a subsidiary of an equity-accounted company, the dilution impact is recognised in the Group’s share of the profit (loss) of the equityaccounted investee. ----- Business combinations As required by IFRS 3 revised, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) in a business combination is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred on the date of the transaction. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in ""Other operating expenses"", except for those related to the issue of equity instruments. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each business combination, the Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case, the amount of goodwill is limited to the portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method. Under the full goodwill method, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value and goodwill is recognised on the full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial goodwill method, which was the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3. In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is remeasured at fair value at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the previouslyheld interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses""). The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the information needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new information obtained by the buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted after the measurement period (not exceeding 12 months from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent acquisitions of non-controlling interests do not give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill. Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair value, whatever the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration due to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded by adjusting goodwill if they occur during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss for the period under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses"" if they arise after the measurement period, unless the obligation is settled in equity instruments. In that case, the contingent consideration is not remeasured subsequently. Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the following principle: ‐ the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is eliminated in full from the accounts of the acquirer; ‐ non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a corresponding adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total equity. Costs and expenses related to intra-group transfers of shares and to internal restructuring in general are included in ""Other operating expenses"". Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the Group’s parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their financial transactions are measured in that currency. The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent company are translated using the closing rate method, as follows: - assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated into euros at the closing rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date; - income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the period unless significant variances occur. The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on translation of the net investment in the operation concerned at successive reporting dates are reclassified to profit or loss. Because the Group applies the step-by-step method of consolidation, the cumulative translation differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if the foreign operation disposed is part of a sub-group. This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the sub group. Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and the resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement under ""Foreign currency exchange gains"" or ""Foreign currency exchange losses"". Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a separate component of equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment ----- Exchange differences arising on translation of (i) foreign currency borrowings hedging a net investment denominated in a foreign currency or (ii) permanent advances made to subsidiaries are also recognised in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. In accordance with IAS 29, the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies are (i) restated to take account of changes in the general purchasing power of the local currency, using official price indices applicable on the reporting date, and (ii) converted into euros at the exchange rate on the reporting date. The Group has qualified Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy since 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.70,3.1 Transactions affecting the scope of consolidation in 2020 3.1.1 Mercialys TRS,28.70.1,,"On 26 July 2018, in connection with the announced asset disposal plan, the Group reduced its stake in Mercialys from 40.3% of the voting rights to 25.3%, through the block sale to a bank of shares representing 15% of the capital under a total return swap (TRS). Under the terms of the transaction, the Group received immediate proceeds amounting to €213 million before disposal costs (€209 million after disposal costs). Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank. Consequently, the shares were not derecognised and a debt was recorded in respect of the shares not yet sold on the market. As of 31 December 2019, 64.6% of the shares underlying the TRS had been sold. A corresponding capital loss of €20 million was recorded in “Other operating expenses” and the liability stood at €102 million. The remaining portion of the shares unsold under the TRS were classified as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 in an amount of €46 million. On 21 August 2020, the Group transferred a 5% stake in Mercialys to the TRS, allowing it to immediately collect €26 million held in a segregated account in connection with the repayment of gross debt. At 31 December 2020, all of the shares underlying the TRS had been sold and Mercialys was accounted for by the equity method based on a percentage interest of 20.3% (30.6% at 31 December 2019). Upon unwinding the TRS, the Group recognised a loss of €72 million in “Other operating expenses” (Note 6.5). In all, the Group paid out €47 million in 2020 in respect of the TRS, net of the €26 million collected from the 5% stake transferred (Note 4.6).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The disposal agreement provides for a transition period during which Casino Group will continue to manage day-to-day operations in its capacity as “parent” while the stores are gradually converted to the Aldi banner throughout 2021. Under the disposal agreement, Casino (the seller) also grants to Aldi (the buyer) the customary representations and warranties. These include a specific seller’s warranty for €100 million (Note 6.11.1). Casino Group remains the owner of the Leader Price brand and can continue to operate it within and outside France under certain conditions agreed with Aldi. The Group thereby keeps its wholesale activity for 200 Leader Price franchised stores as well as internal and external customers (Franprix, Casino Géant and Casino supermarkets). The sale was completed following information and consultation with the employee representative bodies and clearance from the French competition authorities, which was granted on 17 November 2020. At closing, the Group had relinquished control of Leader Price by transferring its voting rights and other attached rights in the entities sold to Aldi. Aldi may terminate, at any time and without any notice, Casino’s current mandate to manage and operate the stores during the transition period.

This position is based on (a) the absence of a majority vote on strategic decisions at meetings of the company’s Board of Directors, which is mostly made up of independent Directors, (b) the governance rules stipulating that Casino’s representatives on the Mercialys Board may not take part in decisions concerning transactions carried out with the Group, (c) business contracts entered into between the Group and Mercialys on an arm’s length basis, and (d) an analysis of the votes cast at recent shareholders’ meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related parties do not control shareholder decisions at shareholders’ meetings). The percentage interest is 20% and 31% respectively at 31 December 2020 and 2019. (ii) Tuya was set up in partnership with Éxito and Bancolombia to manage the banking services offered to customers of the stores in Colombia, primarily the possibility of signing up for credit cards in the stores. The partnership structure changed in October 2016 when Éxito became a 50% shareholder of Tuya. (iii) FIC was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco SA (“Itaú Unibanco”) to finance purchases by GPA's customers. It is accounted for using the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over its operating and financial policies. (iv) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of Tuya (interest held by the Éxito sub-group) and FIC (interest held by GPA). Following the sale of Via Varejo, GPA has held 36% of FIC's share capital and voting rights since June 2019.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.87,Transactions with Mercialys,28.87.1,,"Casino has entered into various agreements with Mercialys: ‐ Leases: Casino leases units in certain shopping centres from Mercialys, for which the lease payments are disclosed above. ‐ Property management agreement: Casino provides rental management services for nearly all Mercialys properties. In 2020, the related management fees amounted to €5 million (2019: €6 million). ‐ Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by Casino’s Board of Directors on 19 June 2012 and an addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership’s fundamental principle whereby Casino develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth has been maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects offering satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to propose new projects that will be examined by Casino and tracked during monitoring committee meetings. Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary permits have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of total projected rental revenues from signed leases. The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on the basis of (i) a rent capitalisation rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by reference to the rates used to value Mercialys’ portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the project. Under the new agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to 10% – may also be taken into account for pricing purposes. The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has been maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed. For example, the price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside) difference between the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at the outset. The contracts require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process. In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that could lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group’s food stores. At the end of January 2017, the partnership agreement was extended by three years, until end-2020. The partnership agreement expired in December 2020 as it was not extended by either of the parties. ‐ Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, finance/accounting, IT and real estate support services to Mercialys. In 2020, the related fees amounted to €1 million (2019: €2 million). ‐ Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real estate portfolio enhancement specialists. No services were provided under this agreement in 2020. The parties decided to terminate the agreement on 31 December 2018. A new fixed-term agreement was signed with an initial term of six months (1 January to 30 June 2019), covering asset management services provided by Mercialys' teams on projects managed on Casino's behalf. The agreement is automatically renewable for successive six-month terms up to a maximum of 48 months in total. This agreement expired at the end of 2020 since it was not renewed by either of the parties. ‐ Sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. This agreement lapsed in 2020. ‐ Current account agreement: on 8 September 2005, Mercialys entered into a current account and cash management agreement with Casino. Under this agreement, Mercialys and Casino set up a shareholder current account for all eligible payments, withdrawals or advances of funds between the two companies. Following the reduction in Casino’s interest in Mercialys’ share capital in 2012, the two parties decided to terminate the existing current account and cash management agreement and to enter into a new current account agreement. This agreement maintained Mercialys’ current account with Casino, enabling it to benefit from cash advances of up to €50 million from Casino. The term of the agreement was extended on several occasions. An addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2019, reducing the cash advance limit to €35 million and extending its maturity to 31 December 2021. An addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2020 to extend its maturity to 31 December 2022. No cash advances had been granted to Mercialys at end-December 2020. On 23 December 2020, Mercialys sold five real estate assets to SCI AMR (an equity-accounted company in Mercialys’ books) for a net selling price representing 100% of €198 million. On 21 December 2020, Mercialys also sold another real estate asset to a company outside the Group for a net selling price of €31 million. In the Group’s consolidated financial statements, these two transactions led to the recognition of income totalling €37 million in “Other revenue” and an EBITDA contribution of €19 million resulting from the recognition of previously eliminated margins on real estate development transactions involving Casino and Mercialys (Note 5.1).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In subsequent years, this liability is remeasured and any changes adjust goodwill; - NCI puts granted since IAS 27 revised came into effect are accounted for as transactions between shareholders, with the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests recognised as a deduction from equity.

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.95,Accounting principle,28.95.1,,"Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion of a sale within one year of the date of this classification. Considering these characteristics, net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction from net debt (Note 11). Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. If a disposal plan changes, and/or when the criteria for classification as held for sale are no longer met, assets can no longer be presented in this category. In this case, the asset (or disposal group) is to be carried at the lower of: - its carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset (or disposal group) not been classified as held for sale; - its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell. The impact of these adjustments, which primarily relate to the catching-up of depreciation and/or amortisation not recognised in the period during which the assets were classified as held for sale, is included in “Other operating expenses”. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and: - represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when the operation is disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for sale. When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of cash flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as from the first day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated income statement, “Profit from discontinued operations”, which includes the net profit or loss of the discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment loss recognised to write down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or any after-tax disposal gains or losses. The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method starting from consolidated net profit (loss) and is organised in three sections: - cash flows from operating activities, including taxes, transaction costs for acquisitions of subsidiaries, dividends received from associates and joint ventures and payments received in respect of government grants; - cash flows from (used in) investing activities, including acquisitions of subsidiaries (excluding transaction costs), proceeds from disposals of subsidiaries (including transaction costs), acquisitions and disposals of investments in non-consolidated companies, associates and joint ventures (including transaction costs), contingent consideration paid for business combinations during the measurement period and up to the amount of the identified liability, and acquisitions and disposals of intangible assets and property plant and equipment (including transaction costs and deferred payments). - cash flows from (used in) financing activities, including new borrowings and repayments of borrowings, issues of equity instruments, transactions between shareholders (including transaction costs and any deferred payments), repayments of lease liabilities, net interest paid (cash flows related to finance costs, non-recourse factoring and associated transaction costs, and interest on leases), treasury share transactions and dividend payments. This category also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt. In accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis as the Group’s internal reporting system used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group’s reportable segments are as follows: - France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments (mainly the sub-group banners Casino, Monoprix, Franprix and Vindémia – the latter until its sale on 30 June 2020); - Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin America (mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco-Devoto and Libertad sub-group banners); - E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding company. In 2019, the Franprix-Leader Price operating segment was separated into Franprix, Leader Price and Geimex. The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms of product type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution methods, marketing offer and longterm financial performance. These reportable segments reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual strategy and the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real estate asset management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities (GreenYellow). Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales, trading profit (which includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group’s business units) and EBITDA. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense. Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information. Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.127,6.1 Total revenue Accounting principle Total revenue:,28.127.1,,"Total revenue is analysed between “Net sales” and “Other revenue”. ""Net sales"" include sales by the Group’s stores, service stations, E-commerce sites and restaurants, franchise fees, revenues from business leases and financial services revenues. Most of the amount reported under Group “Net sales” corresponds to revenue included in the scope of IFRS 15. “Other revenue"" consists of revenue from the property development and property trading businesses, rental revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and revenues from the energy business. The majority of amounts reported under “Other revenue” are included in the scope of IFRS 15, while rental revenues are included in the scope of IFRS 16. Revenue is measured at the contract price, corresponding to the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of goods or services. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, which represent the units of account for revenue recognition purposes. Revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of the good or service passes to the customer. Revenue may therefore be recognised at a specific point in time or over time based on the stage of completion. The Group’s main sources of revenue are as follows: - Sales of goods (including through the property trading business): in this case, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, that of delivering the good to the customer. Revenue from these sales is recognised when control of the good is transferred to the customer upon delivery, i.e., generally: - at the checkout for in-store sales; - on receipt of the goods by the franchisee or affiliated store; - on receipt of the goods by the customer for E-commerce sales. - Sales of services, for example sales of subscriptions, franchising fees, logistics services, rental revenue and property management services: in this case, for operations included in the scope of IFRS 15, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, to supply the service. The related revenues are recognised over the period in which the services are performed. - Property development revenues: in this case, the Group generally has several performance obligations, some of which may be satisfied at a given point in time and others over time based on the project's percentage of completion. Profit from property development activities is generally calculated on a percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the projected margin on completion weighted by the percentage of completion determined by the inputs method. - Revenues from the energy business, for which the Group generally identifies a performance obligation when the solar power plant is delivered (in exchange for variable consideration in some cases) or when the energy performance contracts are sold. The Group also sells energy services for which the related revenue is recognised when the service is performed. The vast majority of revenues are recognised at a given point in time. If settlement of the consideration is deferred for an unusually long time and no promise of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms, revenue is recognised by adjusting the consideration for the ----- effects of the time value of money. If significant, the difference between this price and the unadjusted transaction price is recognised in ""Other financial income"" over the payment deferral period, determined using the effective interest method. The Group operates loyalty programmes that enable customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future purchases. Award credits granted to customers under loyalty programmes represent a performance obligation that is separately identifiable from the initial sales transaction. This performance obligation gives rise to the recognition of a contract liability. The corresponding revenue is deferred until the award credits are used by the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.128,"Contract assets and liabilities, incremental costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract",28.128.1,,"- A contract asset corresponds to an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Based on this definition, a receivable does not constitute a contract asset. The Group recognises a contract asset when it has fulfilled all or part of its performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to payment (i.e., the Group does not yet have the right to invoice the customer). In light of its business, contract assets recognised by the Group are not material. - A contract liability corresponds to an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. The Group recognises contract liabilities mainly for award credits granted under its loyalty programmes, advances received and sales for which all or part of the performance obligation has not yet been fulfilled (e.g., sales of subscriptions and gift cards, and future performance obligations of the property development business for which the customer has already been invoiced followed by payment of consideration). - The incremental costs to obtain a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained and which it expects to recover. The costs to fulfil a contract are costs related directly to a contract that generate or enhance the resources that will be used by the Group in satisfying its performance obligations and which it expects to recover. For the Group, the costs to obtain and fulfil contracts correspond primarily to the costs incurred in connection with its franchising and affiliation business. These costs are capitalised and amortised over the life of the franchise or affiliation contract. The capitalised amounts are tested regularly for impairment.

It also includes property development and property trading business costs and changes in the related inventories. Commercial cooperation fees are measured based on contracts signed with suppliers. They are billed in instalments over the year. At each year-end, an accrual is recorded for the amount receivable or payable, corresponding to the difference between the value of the services actually rendered to the supplier and the sum of the instalments billed during the year. Change in inventories Changes in inventories, which may be positive or negative, are determined after taking into account any impairment losses. Logistics costs Logistics costs correspond to the cost of logistics operations managed or outsourced by the Group, comprising all warehousing, handling and freight costs incurred after goods are first received at one of the Group’s sites.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis takes into account the business unit's operating environment and the type, age, turnover characteristics and sales pattern of the products concerned. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by the GPA sub-group which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA’s inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method was applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in the carrying amount together with supplier discounts deducted from ""Cost of goods sold"".

The Group generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount these future lease payments. Future fixed lease payments include adjustments for payments that depend on an index or a contractually defined growth rate. They can also include the value of a purchase option or estimated early termination penalties, when Casino is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Any lease incentives receivable at the lease commencement date are deducted from the fixed lease payments; ‐ right-of-use assets are recognised for the value of the lease liabilities, less any lease incentives received from the lessor, plus any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in respect of any contractual restoration obligations. The Group only includes the lease component of the contract when measuring its lease liabilities. For certain categories of assets where the lease includes a service component as well as a lease component, the Group may recognise a single lease contract (i.e., with no distinction between the service and lease components).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.177,Accounting principle Group as lessee,28.177.2,SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT,"After the commencement date, lease liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease liabilities are: ‐ increased by interest expenses, as calculated by applying a discount rate to the liabilities at the start of the financial period. These interest expenses are recognised in the income statement within “Other financial expenses”; ‐ reduced by any lease payments made. ----- Cash payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities along with cash payments for the interest portion of those liabilities are included within net cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. These lease payments are generally shown on the “Repayments of lease liabilities” and “Interest paid, net” lines. However, lease payments under leases where the underlying asset can be shown to have suffered a prolonged decline in value are presented on a separate line. This is the case, for example, when assets have been written down in full: these lease payments are then presented within “Other repayments” within cash flow from financing activities. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured against right-of-use assets to reflect any lease modifications and in the event of: ‐ changes in the lease term; ‐ changes in the assessment of whether or not a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised; ‐ changes in amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee granted to the lessor; ‐ changes in variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate when the index or rate adjustment takes effect (i.e., when the lease payments are effectively modified). In the first two cases, lease liabilities are remeasured using a discount rate as revised at the remeasurement date. In the last two cases, the discount rate used to measure the lease liabilities on initial recognition remains unchanged. Right-of-use assets are measured using the amortised cost model as from the lease commencement date and over the estimated term of the lease. This gives rise to the recognition of a straight-line depreciation expense in the income statement. Right-of-use assets are reduced by any impairment losses recognised in accordance with IAS 36 (Note 10.5) and are readjusted in line with the remeasurement of lease liabilities. In the event a lease is terminated early, any gains or losses arising as a result of derecognising the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are taken to the income statement within other operating income or other operating expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.177,Accounting principle Group as lessee,28.177.3,ESTIMATING THE LEASE TERM,"The lease term corresponds to the enforceable period of the lease (i.e., the period during which the lease cannot be cancelled by the lessor, plus all possible contractual extensions permitted that are able to be decided unilaterally by the lessee), and takes account of any periods covered by an option to terminate or extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain respectively to not exercise or exercise that option. In estimating the reasonably certain term of a lease, the Group considers all of the characteristics associated with the leased assets (local laws and regulations, location, category – e.g., stores, warehouses, offices, apartments, property/equipment leases, expected useful life, etc.). Under leases of store properties, the Group may also consider economic criteria such as the performance of the leased assets, and whether or not significant recent investments have been made in the stores. Generally, the term of property leases and equipment leases corresponds to the initial term provided for in the lease contract. More specifically, for “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France, the Group generally recognises a term of nine years as the enforceable period of the lease as of the lease commencement date, in accordance with the ANC’s 3 July 2020 position statement. For contracts with automatic renewal clauses, the Group considers that it is unable to anticipate this automatic renewal period at the inception of the lease and that this tacite renewal period only becomes reasonably certain upon expiry of the initial lease term. The right-of-use asset and lease liability are re-estimated at that date, provided that no previous modifying events have occurred, based on an automatically renewable period of nine years. Lastly, the Group may be required to revise the lease term in the event significant leasehold improvements are made during the lease term that could lead to a significant penalty which is reflected in the residual value of the leasehold improvements at the end of the lease.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Within the Group, these exemptions apply mainly to leases of store equipment and office equipment such as tablets, computers, mobile telephones and photocopiers.

Accordingly, the sellerlessee only recognises the net disposal gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor; ‐ the buyer-lessor accounts for the purchase of the asset applying applicable standards and for the lease applying IFRS 16. If the sale of the asset by the seller-lessee does not meet the definition of a sale under IFRS 15, the sale-and-leaseback is accounted for as a financing transaction. Accordingly: ‐ the seller-lessee recognises the transferred asset in its statement of financial position and recognises a financial liability equal to the consideration received from the buyer-lessor; ‐ the buyer-lessor does not recognise the transferred asset in its statement of financial position but recognises a financial asset equal to the considered transferred.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. - **Under defined benefit plans, the Group's obligation is measured using the projected unit credit method based on the agreements effective in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to measure the obligation vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the relevant country. The obligation is measured by independent actuaries annually for the most significant plans and for the employment termination benefit, and regularly for all other plans. Assumptions include expected rate of future salary increases, estimated average years of service, life expectancy and staff turnover rates (based on resignations only). Actuarial gains and losses arise from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (differences between results based on previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred). All actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Past service cost, corresponding to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from the introduction of a new benefit plan or modification of an existing plan, is expensed immediately. The expense in the income statement comprises: - service cost, i.e., the cost of services provided during the year, recognised in trading profit; - past service cost and the effect of plan curtailments or settlements, generally recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses""; - interest cost, corresponding to the discounting adjustment to the projected benefit obligation net of the return on plan assets, recorded in ""Other financial income and expenses"". Interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate defined in IAS 19 to the net obligation (i.e., the projected obligation less related plan assets) recognised in respect of defined benefit plans, as determined at the beginning of the year. The provision recognised in the statement of financial position is measured as the net present value of the obligation less the fair value of plan assets. Provisions for other in service long-term employee benefits - **Other in-service long-term employee benefits, such as jubilees, are also covered by provisions, determined on the basis of an actuarial estimate of vested rights as of the reporting date. Actuarial gains and losses on these benefit plans are recognised immediately in profit or loss. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The grant-date fair value of the options is recognised in ""Employee benefits expense"" over the option vesting period or in ""Other operating expenses"" when the benefit relates to a transaction that is also recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses"" (Note 6.5). The fair value of options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, based on the plan attributes, market data (including the market price of the underlying shares, share price volatility and the risk-free interest rate) at the grant date and assumptions concerning the probability of grantees remaining with the Group until the options vest.

The introduction of IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments did not result in any significant changes to the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements at 31 December 2018. The impact of applying IFRIC 23 was not material, decreasing equity by €7 million at 1 January 2019. In the first half of 2019, the IFRIC was consulted on the classification of liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statement of financial position. In September 2019, the IFRIC decided that these should be presented within current tax liabilities and/or deferred taxes. This classification was not previously applied by the Group, which reported provisions for uncertain income tax positions within provisions for risks and expenses. As a result of applying IFRIC 23 using the modified retrospective method (i.e., with no restatement of comparative information), the Group reclassified €9 million at 1 January 2019. ----- The cost of non-current assets corresponds to their purchase cost plus transaction expenses including tax.

The French corporate value-added tax (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises – CVAE) which is based on the value-added reflected in the separate financial statements, is included in ""Income tax expense"" in the consolidated income statement. When payments to holders of equity instruments are deductible for tax purposes, the tax effect is recognised by the Group in the income statement. ----- The cost of non-current assets corresponds to their purchase cost plus transaction expenses including tax. For intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property, these expenses are added to the assets' carrying amount and follow the same accounting treatment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually, at the end of the year, for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Cash Generating Units (CGUs) A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Group has defined its cash generating units as follows: - for hypermarkets, supermarkets and discount stores, each store is treated as a separate CGU; - for other networks, each network represents a separate CGU. Impairment indicators Apart from the external sources of data monitored by the Group (economic environment, market value of the assets, etc.), the impairment indicators used are based on the nature of the assets: - land and buildings: loss of rent or early termination of a lease; - operating assets related to the business (assets of the CGU): ratio of net carrying amount of store assets divided by sales (including VAT) higher than a defined level determined separately for each store category; - assets allocated to administrative activities (headquarters and warehouses): site closure or obsolescence of equipment used at the site. Recoverable amount The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is generally determined separately for each asset. When this is not possible, the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the asset belongs is used. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal. In the retail industry, fair value less costs to sell is generally determined on the basis of a sales or EBITDA multiple. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of an asset plus a terminal value. It is determined internally or by external experts on the basis of: - cash flow projections contained usually in business plans covering three years. Cash flows beyond this projection period are usually estimated over a period of three years by applying a growth rate as determined by management (generally constant); - a terminal value determined by applying a perpetual growth rate to the final year's cash flow projection. The cash flows and terminal value are discounted at long-term after-tax market rates reflecting market estimates of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset. Impairment losses An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or the CGU to which it belongs is greater than its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recorded as an expense under ""Other operating income and expenses"". Impairment losses recognised in a prior period are reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. However, the increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot be reversed. The procedure to be followed to ensure that the carrying amount of assets does not exceed their recoverable amount (recovered by use or sale) is defined in IAS 36. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually, at the end of the year, for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. Cash Generating Units (CGUs) A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Group has defined its cash generating units as follows: - for hypermarkets, supermarkets and discount stores, each store is treated as a separate CGU; - for other networks, each network represents a separate CGU. Impairment indicators Apart from the external sources of data monitored by the Group (economic environment, market value of the assets, etc.), the impairment indicators used are based on the nature of the assets: - land and buildings: loss of rent or early termination of a lease; - operating assets related to the business (assets of the CGU): ratio of net carrying amount of store assets divided by sales (including VAT) higher than a defined level determined separately for each store category; - assets allocated to administrative activities (headquarters and warehouses): site closure or obsolescence of equipment used at the site. Recoverable amount The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. It is generally determined separately for each asset. When this is not possible, the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the asset belongs is used. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of disposal.

Following the tests carried out in 2019, impairment losses totalling €111 million had been recognised on goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment property and right-of-use assets, of which €52 million arose from restructuring operations mainly in the France Retail segment and €59 million related to individual assets primarily in the France Retail segment. ----- Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated and comparing them with the carrying amounts of the relevant assets. Goodwill arising on the initial acquisition of networks is allocated to the groups of CGUs in accordance with the classifications presented in Note 10.1.1. Some goodwill may also occasionally be allocated directly to CGUs. Annual impairment testing consists of determining the recoverable amount of each CGU based on value in use, in accordance with the principles described in Note 10.1. Value in use is determined by the discounted cash flows method, based on after-tax cash flows and using the following rates.

(ii) The discount rate corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each country. WACC is calculated at least once a year during the annual impairment testing exercise by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk premium and the Group's cost of debt for France and the local cost of debt for subsidiaries outside France. (iii) At 31 December 2020, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €3,160 million, €1,481 million and €1,036 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based on their value in use (see below). No impairment loss was recognised at 31 December 2020 from the annual goodwill impairment test conducted at the end of the year. The tests carried out at 30 June 2020 on CGU goodwill for which there was evidence of impairment resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of €15 million for the Catering business, leading to the write-down of the full amount of goodwill relating to this business. In view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key assumptions set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 25-basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point decrease in the EBITDA margin for the cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Financial assets are classified as current if they are due in less than one year at the closing date and non-current if they are due in more than one year.,N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Transaction costs and issue and redemption premiums directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability are deducted from the liability’s carrying amount. The costs are then amortised over the life of the liability by the effective interest method. Within the Group, some loans and other financial liabilities at amortised cost are hedged. Several subsidiaries have set up reverse factoring programmes with financial institutions to enable their suppliers to collect receivables more quickly in the ordinary course of the purchasing process. The accounting policy for these transactions depends on whether or not the characteristics of the liabilities concerned have been changed. For example, when trade payables are not substantially modified (term and due date, consideration, face value) they continue to be recorded under ""Trade payables"".

WACC is calculated at least once a year during the annual impairment testing exercise by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk premium and the Group's cost of debt for France and the local cost of debt for subsidiaries outside France. (iii) At 31 December 2019, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €5,202 million, €1,683 million and €856 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based on their value in use (see below). At 31 December 2019 the Group recognised a €17 million impairment loss against the catering business in France as a result of the year-end goodwill impairment test. In view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key assumptions set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 25-basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point decrease in the EBITDA margin for the cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The contract's maturity was extended on 23 December 2016 and again on 27 October 2017. The interest rate is currently set at 3-month Euribor plus 199 bps and the contract expires in June 2020. It will start to be unwound as from 1 April 2020. This TRS is a derivative instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2019, it concerned 7.8 million ADRs (2.9% of GPA’s capital) representing a notional amount of €332 million, and had a negative fair value of €177 million (31 December 2018: 7.8 million ADRs, a notional amount of €332 million and a negative fair value of €172 million). This instrument’s fair value is determined based on the estimated settlement price on 31 December, using the share price on that date. A 10% increase in the share price would have reduced the loss for the period by €15 million. A 10% decline in the share price would have produced the opposite effect. - At the end of December 2012, the Group entered into a 2-year forward contract with a financial institution on 5.8 million GPA shares. On 28 July 2016, the maturity was extended and the notional amount was reduced by USD 105 million (€95 million), resulting in a cash payment made by the Group on the same day. The maturity was extended again in June 2017. The forward concerned 5.8 million shares at 31 December 2018 and was unwound between August and December 2019. A cash payment of €109 million was made in 2019 (versus a negative fair value of €101 million at 31 December 2018). ----- The total return swap (TRS) and forward contracts on GPA shares are cash-settled instruments. The documentation states that when the contracts expire, the shares will be sold on the market by the banking counterparties, and the Group will receive or pay the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid by the counterparties to purchase the shares at the contracts' inception.

On 28 July 2016, the maturity was extended and the notional amount was reduced by USD 105 million (€95 million), resulting in a cash payment made by the Group on the same day. The maturity was extended again in June 2017. The interest rate currently corresponds to the 3-month Libor plus 204 bps and the contract expires in February 2020. This forward is a derivative instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31 December 2018, it related to 5.8 million shares (2.2% of GPA's capital) representing a notional amount of USD 239 million (€209 million), and had a negative fair value of €101 million (31 December 2017: 5.8 million shares, a notional amount of USD 239 million (€199 million) and a negative fair value of €83 million). These instruments' fair value is determined based on the estimated settlement price on 31 December, using the share price on that date. The instruments had a negative fair value of €272 million as at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: negative fair value of €260 million) (Note 11.5.1). A 10% increase in the share price would have reduced the loss for the period by €25 million. A 10% decline in the share price would have produced the opposite effect. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In 2017, deferred taxes were measured at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, taking into account the adoption on 21 December 2017 of the 2018 Finance Act providing for a gradual reduction in the corporate tax rate to 25.825% in 2022 and beyond. This change had a positive impact on deferred taxes of €13 million. (v) Tax laws in some countries cap the deductibility of interest paid by companies. In France, since the 2012 amended Finance Act, companies are required to add back 25% of interest expense to their taxable profit. The resulting income tax amounts disclosed for the periods presented mainly concern French entities. (vi) See Note 6.3. (vii) Corresponding to the non-deductible negative foreign currency translation reserve reclassified to profit or loss (Note 6.5). (viii) In 2017, the Group recorded a tax benefit of €60 million corresponding to a refund of the tax on distributed earnings received from the French State at the end of the year, including €54 million relating to previous years. (ix) This concerns dividends paid by Brazilian subsidiaries in the form of interest on equity. (x) Corresponding to taxation of intra-group dividends. (xi) In 2017, a deferred tax liability of €10 million was recorded on the taxable temporary difference between the carrying amount of Mercialys shares and their tax basis, in accordance with IAS 12. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

(ii) The discount rate corresponds to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each country. WACC is calculated at least once a year during the annual impairment testing exercise by taking account of the sector's levered beta, a market risk premium and the Group's cost of debt for France and the local cost of debt for subsidiaries outside France. (iii) As at 31 December 2018, the market capitalisation of the listed subsidiaries GPA, Éxito and Cnova was €4,863 million, €1,490 million and €1,243 million, respectively. With the exception of Cnova, these market capitalisations were less than the carrying amount of the subsidiaries' net assets. Impairment tests on GPA and Éxito goodwill were performed based on their value in use (see below). No impairment loss was recognised as at 31 December 2018 from the annual goodwill impairment test conducted at the end of the year. With the exception of Franprix-Leader Price, in view of the positive difference between value in use and carrying amount, the Group believes that on the basis of reasonably foreseeable events, any changes in the key assumptions set out above would not lead to the recognition of an impairment loss. The Group considers reasonably foreseeable changes in key assumptions to be a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 25-basis point decrease in the perpetual growth rate used to calculate terminal value or a 50-basis point decrease in the EBITDA margin for the cash flow projection used to calculate the terminal value. The recoverable amount of the Franprix-Leader Price CGU was determined by reference to its value in use, calculated from cash flow projections based on three-year financial budgets approved by Senior Management, extrapolation of projections over a period of three years, a terminal value calculated from perpetual capitalisation of notional annual cash flow based on cash flows taken from the last year of forecasts, and a 5.6% discount rate (2017: 5.6%). ----- The cash flow projections for the budget period were based on the following assumptions: - optimisation of the Leader Price store base. - ongoing deployment of a banner strategy based on a balance between integrated management stores and franchisees. - restoration of the two banners’ profitability (EBITDA margins) to a rate in line with the historical average, led by larger product volumes and optimised store and upstream function cost bases. Management believes that a change in a key assumption could result in a carrying amount greater than the recoverable amount.

In 2020, the Group continued to strengthen its financial structure by carrying out several transactions. It redeemed its unsecured bond issues on the financial markets and launched two public buyback offers in November and December 2020. In all, the redemptions represented a nominal amount of €1,400 million, of which €467 million was due to mature in May 2021, €122 million in June 2022, €448 million in January 2023, €289 million in March 2024, and €74 million in February 2025. ----- The December 2020 buyback offer was accompanied by two new sources of financing: - issue of €400 million worth of unsecured bonds, paying a coupon of 6.625% and maturing in January 2026.

This new credit line was subscribed by 21 French and international banks. The refinancing transactions extended the average maturity of the Group’s confirmed credit facilities by two years, from 1.6 years at 31 December 2018 to 3.6 years at end-2019. The Group also proved its ability to raise funds on the capital and private placement markets in two transactions carried out in November 2019 in the form of a €1 billion secured term loan and an €800 million secured bond issue. These two instruments fall due in January 2024 and were heavily oversubscribed. They enable the Group to finance the tender offer on the bonds maturing in 2020, 2021 and 2022 for a nominal amount of €784 million and to repay the drawn credit lines to date for a total amount of €630 million. The average maturity of the Group's debt increased to 3.8 years from 3.3 years previously.

The Term Loan B and high-yield bond also include incurrence covenants, which only apply upon the occurrence of certain specific events or to enable certain transactions to proceed, in particular: - an incurrence covenant will apply in the event special dividends are paid in addition to ordinary dividends[1], as follows: gross debt/EBITDA (France Retail + E-commerce): < 3.5x; - leverage and secured debt leverage covenants or a fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR) as defined in the documentation may be applied on an independent or additional basis, depending on the transactions planned: - FCCR: EBITDA[2]/Fixed charges[2]: > 2 - Secured debt leverage: Consolidated leverage[2]/EBITDA[2]: < 2 |Main types of debt subject to covenant|Frequency of tests|Ratio at 31 December 2020| |---|---|---| |RCF for €2,000 million|Quarterly|5.03| |||4.01| ----- 1 50% of net profit attributable to owners to the parent, with a minimum of €100 million per year from 2021 and an additional €100 million that may be used for one or several distributions during the life of the debt. 2 As defined in the loan agreements. The Group's loan and bond agreements include the usual clauses for such contracts, notably pari passu, negative pledge and cross-default clauses. Change-of-control clauses are included in all of Casino’s bond financing documentation issued up to 2018, except for the documentation relating to the €600 million deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI) issued in 2005. Change of control is established when two criteria are met: - a third party, other than Rallye and its affiliates, acting alone or in concert, acquires shares conferring more than 50% of Casino's voting rights; and - this change of control directly triggers a downgrade of Casino’s long-term credit rating (by at least one notch in the event that Casino’s rating is not investment grade). The impact on the Group’s bond issues are as follows: - for bonds issued under the EMTN programme, representing a cumulative nominal amount of €2,222 million at 31 December 2020, each bond investor would be entitled to request from Casino the early redemption of all its bonds at par, at its individual discretion; - for €750 million worth of TSSDI issued in 2013, the interest would be raised by an additional spread of 5% per annum and Casino would be entitled to buy back all of the bonds at par. The documentation for the 2019 and 2020 refinancing transactions also includes change-of-control clauses for three entities: - Casino, Guichard-Perrachon (RCF/Term Loan B/Quatrim high-yield borrowings/2026 high-yield bond): an entity other than Rallye or one of its affiliated entities holds more than 50% of Casino’s share capital or if substantially all of the Group’s assets are sold/transferred; - Casino Finance (RCF): a third party (other than Rallye or its affiliates) takes control of Casino Finance; - Monoprix (RCF): Monoprix is no longer controlled by Casino and/or its subsidiaries or if the percentage of ownership interest or voting rights held (by Casino and/or its subsidiaries) is lower than 40%. A change of control would offer the lenders the possibility of cancelling their commitments at their individual discretion (limited to one-third of the nominal amount of the RCF in the event of a change of control of Monoprix). In the case of the high-yield bond issue, Quatrim, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon that issued the bonds, would launch a tender offer (at a specified price) in which investors could participate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2926,EXPOSURE TO LIQUIDITY RISK,2926.5,Accounting principle,2926.5.1,,"Equity is attributable to two categories of owner: the owners of the parent (Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shareholders) and the owners of the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries. A non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Transactions with the owners of non-controlling interests resulting in a change in the parent company’s percentage interest without loss of control affect only equity as there is no change of control of the economic entity. Cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a fully consolidated subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control (including increases in percentage interest) are classified as cash flows from financing activities. In the case of an acquisition of an additional interest in a fully consolidated subsidiary, the Group recognises the difference between the acquisition cost and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests as a change in equity attributable to owners of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon. Transaction costs are also recognised in equity. The same treatment applies to transaction costs relating to disposals without loss of control. In the case of disposals of controlling interests involving a loss of control, the Group derecognises the whole of the ownership interest and, where appropriate, recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value. The gain or loss on the entire derecognised interest (interest sold and interest retained) is recognised in profit or loss under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses"", which amounts to remeasuring the retained previously-held investment at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flows arising from the acquisition or loss of control of a subsidiary are classified as cash flows from investing activities. Equity instruments and hybrid instruments The classification of instruments issued by the Group in equity or debt depends on each instrument’s specific characteristics. An instrument is deemed to be an equity instrument when the following two conditions are met: - the instrument does not contain a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; and - in the case of a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that does not include a contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments, or it is a derivative that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments. The Group also examines the special provisions of contracts to ensure the absence of an indirect obligation to buy back the equity instruments in cash or by delivering another financial asset or by delivering shares with a value substantially higher than the amount of cash or the other financial asset to be delivered. In particular, instruments that are redeemable at the Group’s discretion and for which the remuneration depends on the payment of a dividend are classified in equity. When a ""debt"" component exists, it is measured separately and classified under ""financial liabilities"". Equity transaction costs External and qualifying internal costs directly attributable to equity transactions or transactions involving equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity, net of tax. All other transaction costs are recognised as an expense. Treasury shares Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares purchased by the Group are deducted from equity at cost. The proceeds from sales of treasury shares are credited to equity with the result that any disposal gains or losses, net of the related tax effect, have no impact in the income statement for the period. Options on treasury shares Options on treasury shares are treated as derivative instruments, equity instruments or financial liabilities depending on their characteristics. Options classified as derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Options classified as equity instruments are recorded in equity at their initial amount and changes in value are not recognised. The accounting treatment of financial liabilities is described in Note 11. ----- Equity is attributable to two categories of owner: the owners of the parent (Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shareholders) and the owners of the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries. A non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Transactions with the owners of non-controlling interests resulting in a change in the parent company’s percentage interest without loss of control affect only equity as there is no change of control of the economic entity. Cash flows arising from changes in ownership interests in a fully consolidated subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control (including increases in percentage interest) are classified as cash flows from financing activities. In the case of an acquisition of an additional interest in a fully consolidated subsidiary, the Group recognises the difference between the acquisition cost and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests as a change in equity attributable to owners of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon. Transaction costs are also recognised in equity. The same treatment applies to transaction costs relating to disposals without loss of control. In the case of disposals of controlling interests involving a loss of control, the Group derecognises the whole of the ownership interest and, where appropriate, recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value. The gain or loss on the entire derecognised interest (interest sold and interest retained) is recognised in profit or loss under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses"", which amounts to remeasuring the retained previously-held investment at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flows arising from the acquisition or loss of control of a subsidiary are classified as cash flows from investing activities. Equity instruments and hybrid instruments The classification of instruments issued by the Group in equity or debt depends on each instrument’s specific characteristics. An instrument is deemed to be an equity instrument when the following two conditions are met: - the instrument does not contain a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; and - in the case of a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that does not include a contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments, or it is a derivative that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments. The Group also examines the special provisions of contracts to ensure the absence of an indirect obligation to buy back the equity instruments in cash or by delivering another financial asset or by delivering shares with a value substantially higher than the amount of cash or the other financial asset to be delivered. In particular, instruments that are redeemable at the Group’s discretion and for which the remuneration depends on the payment of a dividend are classified in equity. When a ""debt"" component exists, it is measured separately and classified under ""financial liabilities"". Equity transaction costs External and qualifying internal costs directly attributable to equity transactions or transactions involving equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity, net of tax. All other transaction costs are recognised as an expense. Treasury shares Casino, Guichard-Perrachon shares purchased by the Group are deducted from equity at cost. The proceeds from sales of treasury shares are credited to equity with the result that any disposal gains or losses, net of the related tax effect, have no impact in the income statement for the period. Options on treasury shares Options on treasury shares are treated as derivative instruments, equity instruments or financial liabilities depending on their characteristics.

At 31 December 2020, Casino holds 41.2% of the capital and voting rights of GPA, which is fully consolidated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

(iv) Other comprehensive income (loss) consists mainly of exchange differences arising on translation of foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements. (v) GPA holds 97% of Éxito’s share capital. Éxito remains the majority shareholder of the Group’s subsidiaries in Argentina (mainly Libertad with a 100% interest) and Uruguay (mainly Disco and Devoto in which it holds 62.5% and 100%, respectively, of the economic rights). At the General Shareholders' Meeting on 30 December 2019, GPA’s shareholders approved the migration of the company’s shares to Brazil’s Novo Mercado B3 listing segment. Accordingly, all preferred shares were converted into ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 1:1, and the migration/conversion was completed at the beginning of March 2020. These transactions marked the final steps in the Group’s efforts to simplify its structure in Latin America (Note 2). At 31 December 2019, Casino holds 99.9% of GPA’s voting rights and 41.3% of its capital. On 2 March 2020, GPA’s share capital comprised a single class of shares, of which Casino held 41.2%. |GPA|Éxito(ii) Colombia 1,149 44.7% 44.7%|Other 42|Total 5,373| |---|---|---|---| |o/w Via Total GPA(i) Varejo Brazil Brazil 4,182 1,222 66.9% 85.7% 0.06% 37.5%|||| |214 (9) (423) 60 (46) (2) 7 1 3,934 1,272 66.9% 85.7% 0.06% 60.6% 88 (20) (56) (104) (39) - (2,226) (1,148) 1,702 - 58.7% 0.06%|35 (29) (24) 93 1,224 44.7% 44.7% 32 8 (34) 525 1,755 60.2% (v)|(5) (4) (33) 49 50 (11) - (19) 47 67|244 (456) (103) 149 5,208 110 (48) (92) (1,654) 3,523| |34.4% 41.3%|52.7% 39.8%||| -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Provisions are discounted when the related adjustment is material. In accordance with the above principle, a provision is recorded for the cost of repairing equipment sold with a warranty. The provision represents the estimated cost of repairs to be performed during the warranty period, as estimated on the basis of actual costs incurred in prior years. Each year, part of the provision is reversed to offset the actual repair costs recognised in expenses. A provision for restructuring expenses is recorded when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure. This is the case when management has drawn up a detailed, formal plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by announcing its main features to them before the period-end. Other provisions concern specifically identified liabilities and expenses. Contingent liabilities correspond to possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Group’s control, or present obligations whose settlement is not expected to require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method starting from consolidated net profit/(loss) and is organised in three sections: - Cash flows from operating activities, including taxes, transaction costs for acquisitions of subsidiaries, dividends received from associates and joint ventures and payments received in respect of government grants. - Cash flows from/(used in) investing activities, including acquisitions of subsidiaries (excluding transaction costs), proceeds from disposals of subsidiaries (including transaction costs), acquisitions and disposals of investments in non-consolidated companies, associates and joint ventures (including transaction costs), contingent consideration paid for business combinations during the measurement period and up to the amount of the identified liability, and acquisitions and disposals of intangible assets and property plant and equipment (including transaction costs and deferred payments). - Cash flows from/(used in) financing activities, including new borrowings and repayments of borrowings, issues of equity instruments, transactions between shareholders (including transaction costs and any deferred payments), repayments of lease liabilities, net interest paid (cash flows related to finance costs, non-recourse factoring and associated transaction costs, and interest on leases), treasury share transactions and dividend payments. This category also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt. In accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis as the Group’s internal reporting system used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group’s reportable segments are as follows: - France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments (mainly the Casino, Monoprix, Franprix and Vindémia sub-group banners); - Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin America (mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco-Devoto and Libertad sub-group banners); - E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding company. During the year, the Franprix-Leader Price operating segment was separated into Franprix, Leader Price and Geimex. The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms of product type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution methods, marketing offer and long-term financial performance. These reportable segments reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual strategy and the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real estate asset management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities. Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales, trading profit (which includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group's business units) and EBITDA. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense. Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information. Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements. Gross margin Gross margin corresponds to the difference between ""Net sales"" and the ""Cost of goods sold"". “Cost of goods sold"" comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees and any tax credits associated with the purchases, changes in retail inventories and logistics costs. It also includes property development and property trading business costs and changes in the related inventories. Commercial cooperation fees are measured based on contracts signed with suppliers. They are billed in instalments over the year. At each year-end, an accrual is recorded for the amount receivable or payable, corresponding to the difference between the value of the services actually rendered to the supplier and the sum of the instalments billed during the year. Change in inventories Changes in inventories, which may be positive or negative, are determined after taking into account any impairment losses. Logistics costs Logistics costs correspond to the cost of logistics operations managed or outsourced by the Group, comprising all warehousing, handling and freight costs incurred after goods are first received at one of the Group’s sites. Transport costs included in suppliers’ invoices (e.g., for goods purchased on a ""delivery duty paid"" or ""DDP"" basis) are included in “Purchases and change in inventories”. Outsourced transport costs are recognised under ""Logistics costs"". A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The case involves a series of credit notes totalling €22 million issued in 2013 and 2014 by 41 suppliers. The DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned together with a fine of €2 million. On 27 April 2020, the Paris Commercial Court handed down its decision, dismissing most of the DGCCRF’s claims. The Court considered that there was no evidence to support DGCCRF’s claims of unlawful behaviour concerning 34 suppliers. It partly accepting the DGCCRF’s claims concerning the other seven suppliers. Casino Group was ordered to refund a series of credit notes issued in 2013 and 2014 by the seven suppliers for a total of €2 million, and to pay a fine of €1 million. In early January 2021, the DGCCRF filed an appeal against the Paris Commercial Court’s decision. As no application was made for provisional enforcement, the appeal has suspensive effect. Casino Group maintains that it acted in accordance with applicable regulations in its negotiations with the suppliers concerned. Based on this and on the advice of its legal counsel, the Group considers that the associated risk on its financial statements is limited. On 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and its parent companies Intermarché and Casino, were prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices that allegedly took place in 2015 against 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a fine of €2 million. The proceedings in both cases are still in progress. The Group considers that it complied with the applicable regulations during negotiations with the suppliers concerned by both sets of proceedings. Based on this and on the advice of its legal counsel, the Group considers that the associated risk on its financial statements is limited. Moreover, the Group is subject to regular inquiries by the French and European competition authorities. In early February 2017, representatives of France’s Competition Authority raided the premises of Vindémia Logistique and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply and distribution activities on Reunion Island. On 7 December 2020, the Competition Authority officially ruled that it no longer has jurisdiction over this case. At the end of February 2017, representatives of the European Commission raided the premises of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon Achats Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino Achats (INCA-A), in connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers. In May 2019, representatives of the European Commission conducted additional raids of the premises of the same companies (except for INCA-A, which has since ceased operations and is in the process of being liquidated). The European Commission has not issued any complaint at this stage. On 5 October 2020, the General Court of the European Union ruled that the raids conducted by the Commission in February 2017 were partially unlawful. The case is currently being appealed before the Court of Justice of the European Union, seeking to have all of the 2017 raids classified as unlawful; proceedings are also currently pending before the General Court of the European Union in respect of the raids carried out in May 2019. The Group is not currently able to reliably predict the outcome of this matter. In June 2018, after giving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, the French Competition Authority launched an investigation into the creation of joint purchasing organisations in the food retailing sector. The investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing organisation set up between Auchan, Casino, Metro d S hi O 22 O t b 2020 th C titi A th it ffi i ll l d it i ti ti i t th H i t l ----- purchasing organisation, subject to Horizon’s compliance with the commitments undertaken to limit the extent of its cooperation on private-label brands. - **Arbitration between GPA and Peninsula On 12 September 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro Península (""Península"") in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related to leasing agreements concerning stores owned by Peninsula and operated by GPA. The agreements have a duration of 20 years as from 2005 and are renewable for another 20-year period at the sole discretion of GPA. They set out the method for calculating rental charges. Despite the discussions concerning application of the lease terms, the request for arbitration has no impact on the operation of the leased stores, which is contractually guaranteed. At this stage of the arbitration process, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the related risk. Based on the opinion of its legal advisors, the Company considers as possible the risk of an unfavourable ruling by the arbitral tribunal. - **Dispute between Cnova and Via Varejo On 31 October 2016, ahead of the GPA’s announcement of its decision to start negotiations for the sale of its stake in Via Varejo, Via Varejo completed its combination with Cnova Brazil, responsible for the Group’s e-commerce business in the country. The combination involved the acquisition by Via Varejo of 100% of Cnova Brazil’s shares from Cnova N.V. (“Cnova”). The combination agreement included the usual vendor warranty compensation clauses. In September 2019, Via Varejo notified Cnova of a guarantee call for an undocumented amount of around BRL 65 million (€11 million), concerning litigation with employees and customers. Following this notification, Cnova and Via Varejo exchanged information in order to determine the substance and, where appropriate, the scope of the compensation claim. In light of the extensive analyses currently in progress and the discussions that are likely to result from the analyses, Cnova is unable to determine the extent of its exposure to this risk. On 20 July 2020, Cnova received notification that Via Varejo had commenced arbitration proceedings. On 22 January 2021, Via Varejo submitted its declaration in connection with these proceedings but no additional evidence has been provided. Accordingly, Cnova remains unable to determine the extent of the risk and/or of its liability, if any. - **GPA tax, social and civil contingent liabilities On 28 February 2017, the French Ministry of the Economy, represented by the Department of Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), brought an action against Casino in the Paris Commercial Court. The case involves a series of credit notes totalling €22.2 million issued in 2013 and 2014 by 41 suppliers. The DGCCRF is seeking repayment of this sum to the suppliers concerned together with a fine of €2 million. Also, on 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and its parent companies Intermarché and Casino, were prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices that allegedly took place in 2015 against 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a fine of €2 million. The proceedings in both cases are still in progress. The Group considers that it complied with the applicable regulations during negotiations with the suppliers concerned by both sets of proceedings. Consequently, no provision has been set aside for these matters. Moreover, the Group is subject to regular inquiries by the French and European competition authorities. In early February 2017, representatives of France’s Competition Authority raided the premises of Vindémia Logistique and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply and distribution activities on Reunion Island. The Competition Authority has not issued a complaint at this stage. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of the investigation. At the end of February 2017, representatives of the European Commission raided the premises of Casino, GuichardPerrachon, Achats Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino Achats (INCAA), in connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers. In May 2019, representatives of the European Commission conducted additional raids of the premises of the same companies (except for INCA-A, which has since ceased operations and is in the process of being liquidated). The European Commission has not issued any complaint at this stage. Applications filed by the Casino Group to contest the legitimacy of the European Commission’s series of raids are pending before the General Court of the European Union. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of this matter. In June 2018, after giving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, the French Competition Authority launched an informal investigation into the creation of joint purchasing organisations in the food retailing sector. ----- Investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing organisation set up between Auchan, Casino, Metro and Schiever.

At 31 December 2020, the estimated amount was €30 million (31 December 2019: €44 million). Moreover, Casino has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax adjustments received from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,432 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: BRL 1,409 million), including penalties and interest. Under the terms of the guarantee, Casino has undertaken to indemnify GPA for 50% of any damages incurred, provided those damages are definitive. Based on the commitment given by Casino to its subsidiary, the risk exposure amounts to BRL 716 million (€112 million) (31 December 2019: BRL 705 million, representing €156 million). As the risks of liability are only considered possible, Casino has not recognised a provision in its financial statements for this amount. - **GPA contingent assets Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base Since the adoption of non-cumulative regime to calculate PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has challenged the right to deduct ICMS taxes from the calculation basis for PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by a Brazilian federal supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the PIS and COFINS tax base. On 29 October 2020, GPA was notified of a final favourable ruling on its main claim initially filed in 2003. Based on this court decision, GPA considered that the uncertainty that had previously led it to consider this asset as “contingent” within the meaning of IAS 37 had resolved. Accordingly, it recognised a tax credit, net of provisions, amounting to BRL 1,608 ----- million (i.e., income of €273 million recorded in profit before tax for the year), of which BRL 995 million (€169 million) recognised in net sales (Note 5.1) and BRL 613 million (€104 million) recognised in “Other financial income” (Note 11.3.2). At 31 December 2020, the only decision pending related to the legal proceedings concerning the former Sendas subsidiaries, which have since been merged into Sendas SA. Consequently, the corresponding tax credit, estimated at BRL 118 million (€19 million) continues to be classified as a contingent asset and is not recognised in the statement of financial position. Pursuant to the shareholder agreements between GPA and the Klein family following the creation of Via Varejo, which were still in force at 31 December 2020, GPA has a legal right to obtain from Via Varejo the aforementioned tax credits in respect of its former subsidiary Globex for the 2003-2010 period. As a result of the final ruling obtained by Via Varejo on its proceedings with the tax authorities in May 2020, GPA has an unconditional right to obtain a refund of these tax credits from Via Varejo. GPA has recognised a gross amount of BRL 231 million (€39 million) in its income statement in this respect (Note 3.4.2). Pending full legal documentation from Via Varejo for the 2003-2007 period, GPA considers these tax credits as a contingent asset with an estimated value of BRL 277 million (€43 million) at 31 December 2020. #### Note 14 Related-party transactions Related parties are: - parent companies (mainly Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris); - entities that exercise joint control or significant influence over the Company; - subsidiaries (Note 17); - associates (primarily Mercialys) (Note 3.2); - joint ventures (Note 3.2); - members of the Board of Directors and Management Committee (Note 8.4). The Company maintains normal relations with all of its subsidiaries in its day-to-day management of the Group. The Company and its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice and assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris (provision of staff and premises). The amount expensed over the year in relation to these agreements with Casino and its subsidiaries totalled €4.7 million, of which €4.2 million for strategic advisory services and €0.5 million for the provision of staff and premises. In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities, Casino and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys (Note 3.2.6). In November 2020, the Group signed an agreement with the Foncière Euris group to incorporate the Centrum Krakow shopping centre into its 2014 partnership agreement concerning the Serenada shopping mall. This agreement provides for a link-up between these two centres with the aim of creating a regional leader in the north of Krakow In 2020, the Group committed to this new partnership by investing €13 million in two companies jointly controlled with the Foncière Euris group. Related-party transactions with individuals (Directors, corporate officers and members of their families) are not material. #### Note 15 Subsequent events - **Approval for the listing of Assaí On 19 February 2021, GPA announced that it had received (i) on 10 February 2021 approval to list the shares issued by Sendas Distribuidora SA (Assaí) on the Novo Mercado segment of the B3 SA – Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão, and (ii) on 12 February 2021, approval to list the American Depositary Securities (ADSs) of Assaí on the New York Stock Exchange.

A review of the substance of FIC's rights under the agreement confirms that their effect is solely to protect FIC's investment and that, consequently, Viva Malls is controlled by Éxito. (vii) Following measures taken at the end of 2019 to streamline the Group’s structure in Latin America, 96.57% of Éxito is now held by GPA. Based on Colombian rules and regulations, a sole shareholder cannot own more than 95% of an entity’s share capital. GPA therefore has 18 months from the date of the restructuring to reduce its direct shareholding in Éxito. This operation is currently in progress at GPA. 100 100 FC 100 100 FC 100 100 FC 100 100 FC 100 100 FC 100 100 FC ----- #### Note 18 Standards, amendments and interpretations published but not yet mandatory",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and financing, and have led to greater uncertainties as to their future prospects. Some of those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on their internal organisation and the performance of audits. It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823 9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. ----- |Impairment tests of goodwill and brands|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 3 “Scope of consolidation”, Note 10.1 “Goodwill”, Note 10.2 “Other intangible assets” and Note 10.5 “Impairment of non-current assets” to the consolidated financial statements|| |As at 31 December 2020, the net carrying amounts of goodwill and brands with an indefinite useful life recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position amount to €6,656 million and €1,262 million respectively, i.e. approximately 26% of total consolidated assets. Within the context of the valuation of these assets, the Group performs impairment tests on its goodwill and brands at least once a year and whenever an indication of impairment is identified, according to the conditions described in Notes 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 to the consolidated financial statements. We considered the valuation of the values in use applied in determining the recoverable amount of goodwill and brands to be a key audit matter due to: - Their materiality in the consolidated financial statements; - The significance of the estimates notably used as a basis for the determination of their value in use, including turnover and margin rate forecasts, the perpetual growth rates used to determine terminal value, and discount rates; - The sensitivity of the valuation of these values in use to certain assumptions.|We assessed the compliance of the methodology implemented by Management with the accounting standards in force. We also assessed the main estimates used, analysing the following in particular: - The consistency of cash flow projections with the budgets and medium-term business plans prepared by Management, as well as the consistency of the turnover and margin rate forecasts with the Group’s historical performance, in the economic context in which the Group operates; - The methods and parameters used to determine the discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to estimated cash flows. With the assistance of the valuation specialists included in our audit team, we recalculated these discount rates using the most recent market data available and compared the results obtained with (i) the rates used by Management and (ii) the rates observed for several players operating in the same business sector as the Group; - The sensitivity scenarios adopted by Management, of which we verified the arithmetical accuracy. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in particular that relating to sensitivity tests.| ----- |Compliance with bank ratios|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 2 “Significant events of the year” and Note 11.5 “Financial risk management objectives and policies” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Certain loan and credit line agreements, as stated in Note 11.5.4 “Liquidity risk” to the consolidated financial statements, provide for the obligation for the Company and certain subsidiaries to comply with bank ratios in respect of the bank covenants. Any non-compliance with the bank covenants is liable to result in all or part of the debts concerned being immediately payable. We considered compliance with the bank covenants to be a key audit matter, as any failure to comply with these ratios could have impacts on the availability of the group’s confirmed credit lines as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the presentation of financial liabilities as current/non-current in the consolidated financial statements, the liquidity position and, if relevant, the continuation of the company as a going concern.|Within the scope of our audit: - We analysed the Group’s bond and bank documentation, including in particular the covenants, in order to understand the definition of the ratios and corroborated our understanding through interviews with Group Management; - We gained an understanding of the internal control procedures relating to the monitoring of the Group’s liquidity and net financial debt, including the processes for (i) establishing cash flow forecasts, (ii) monitoring net financial debt and (iii) calculating the ratios and complying with the bank covenants; - We verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculation of the ratios produced by Management as at 31 December 2020. - We assessed the level of banking ratios calculated with regard to contractual provisions. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, notably the information on the covenants relating to the financing concerned.| ----- |Recognition of tax credits and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 5.1 “Key indicators by reportable sector”, Note 6.8 “Other current assets”, Note 6.9.1 “Analysis of other non-current assets” and Note 13.3 “Contingent assets and liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Within the scope of its retail activities at GPA, the Group recognises ICMS tax credits. The balance of the credits recognised amounts to €431 million as at 31 December 2020. These tax credits were recognised insofar as GPA considers their recoverability to be probable. GPA is also involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in Brazil arising, notably, from tax claims filed by the Brazilian tax authorities. A part of these tax risks, estimated at €1,792 million as at 31 December 2020, were analysed as contingent liabilities and no provisions were recognised as at 31 December 2020, as stated in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements.|We interviewed the various persons who hold responsibilities in the GPA organisation to identify and gain an understanding of the tax credits and existing disputes, as well as the judgements relating thereto. Concerning the tax credits to be received, we analysed the following items with the assistance of the specialists in Brazilian indirect taxes included in our audit team: - The internal control environment relating to the processes set up by Management to monitor the tax credits and ensure their recoverability, and we tested the related key controls; - The assumptions used by Management to draw up the tax credits recovery plan; - The documentation that evidences either the recognition of ICMS tax credits over the year.| ----- |Recognition of tax credits and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities at GPA (continued)|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 5.1 “Key indicators by reportable sector”, Note 6.8 “Other current assets”, Note 6.9.1 “Analysis of other non-current assets” and Note 13.3 “Contingent assets and liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements (cont’d.)|| |We considered the recognition and recoverability of both the tax credits and the valuation and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities in Brazil to be key audit matters for the following reasons: (i) the significance in the accounts of the tax credit balance and the amount of contingent tax liabilities as at 31 December 2020, (ii) the complexity of the Brazilian tax legislation and (iii) the use of judgements and estimates by Management in connection with the recognition of tax credits and the valuation of the contingent tax liabilities.|Concerning the contingent liabilities, with the assistance of our specialists in Brazilian taxation: - We gained an understanding of the internal control environment relating to the processes for the identification, monitoring and estimation of the level of risk associated with the various disputes, and we tested the related key controls; - We reconciled the list of identified disputes with the information provided by the Brazilian subsidiaries’ law firms that we contacted in order to assess the existence, completeness and amounts of tax proceedings and any necessary provisions, where applicable; - We examined the information on the legal or technical proceedings and/or opinions provided by the main law firms or external experts chosen by Management, in order to assess the correct recognition of the various disputes or the relevance of their classification as contingent liabilities; - We reconciled the risk estimates prepared by the Group with the figures relating to contingent tax liabilities disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| ----- |Valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 6.2 “Cost of goods sold” and Note 6.8 “Other current assets” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Within the scope of its retail activities, the Group receives rebates from its suppliers in the form of discounts and commercial cooperation fees. These rebates, generally paid on the basis of a percentage defined contractually according to purchase volumes and applied to purchases made from suppliers, are recorded as a deduction from cost of goods sold. Considering the material impact of these rebates on net profit for the year, the large number of contracts involved and the necessity for Management to estimate the final rebate percentage determined according to the volume of related purchases for each supplier, we considered the valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit: - We gained an understanding of the internal control environment relating to the process of monitoring these rebates in the Group’s various significant subsidiaries and we carried out tests on the key controls set up by Management; - We reconciled, on a sampling basis, the contractual terms relating to rebates to be received from suppliers with their valuation; - We assessed, on a sampling basis, (i) the year- end rebates estimates used by Management to determine the percentage of rebates by product family for each supplier (ii) and the amounts of the invoices to be issued at year-end relating to this sampling; - We reconciled the receivables recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position with the amounts collected subsequent to year-end.|",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. ----- As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgement throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements; - Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

The following texts had no material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements: - _Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation These amendments are applicable on a retrospective basis. The amendments expand the classification of financial assets at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and clarify the application of the ""solely a payment of principal and interest"" test to certain debt instruments with a prepayment feature where the effect of exercising this clause would reasonably lead to repayments that are lower than the amount of principal and interest due. - _Amendments to IAS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement These amendments will be applicable on a prospective basis. to plan amendments, curtailments and settlements of defined benefit plans. They require an entity to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. - _Amendments to IAS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures These amendments are applicable on a retrospective basis. They clarify that IFRS 9 (including the impairment rules) applies to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied. ----- - _IFRS Annual Improvements – 2015-2017 Cycle The main standards concerned are: - IAS 12 – _Income Taxes: these amendments clarify that the tax consequences of dividend payments (i.e., distributions of profits) should be recognised when the distribution liability is recognised, in profit or loss, equity or other comprehensive income according to where the transactions that generated the distributed profits were presented. They will be applicable on a retrospective basis as from the first comparative period presented. - IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs: these amendments clarify that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity borrows generally.

Two other impacts reflected in the “Other” column essentially relate to: - the finalization of the purchase price allocation for Sarenza, acquired in 2018, which primarily led to the recognition of the Sarenza trademark; - the change in the method of presenting costs to obtain contracts. In 2019, the Group reviewed the presentation of these costs in its statement of financial position. Costs to obtain contracts, previously included in other current and non-current assets are now included in ""Other intangible assets”. The Group believes that this voluntary change of presentation improves the quality of its financial disclosures, as it reflects the way in which this investment – related to the management of its franchise – is itself managed, i.e., as though the Group had acquired an intangible asset (customer relationship). In the income statement, costs to obtain contracts are now recognised over the term of the contract as an amortisation expense within selling expenses and no longer as an expense within cost of goods sold. The amortisation expense for 2018 amounted to €39 million (including the portion relating to Leader Price as a discontinued operation). The reclassification qualifies as a change of method and has therefore been applied retrospectively to 2018 as if the new presentation had been adopted at the beginning of that year. The introduction of IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments did not result in any significant changes to the measurement of uncertain tax balances in the financial statements at 31 December 2018. The Group also reclassified a number of statement of financial position items from “Provisions for risks and expenses” to “Current tax liabilities” and/or “Deferred taxes”. These changes in presentation did not have a material impact. IFRIC 23 was applied using the modified retrospective method, i.e., with no restatement of comparative information (Note 9).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2927,SUMMARISED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE MAIN SUBSIDIARIES WITH MATERIAL NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS,2927.101,1.3.2** **Impact of the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 – Leases,2927.101.1,,"IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 and the related interpretations as from 1 January 2019 and removes the distinction between operating and finance leases, introducing a single lessee accounting model and requiring lessees to recognise assets (right to use the underlying leased asset for the estimated term of the lease) and liabilities (lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments) for substantially all leases. Operating lease expense in the consolidated income statement is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset presented in “Cost of goods sold” or “Selling expenses”, and interest expense on the financial liability presented in “Other financial expenses”. Previously, the Group classified most of its leases as operating leases and recognised rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term; no asset or liability was recognised except to reflect any timing difference between the rental payment period and the period in which the related expense is recognised. Compared to IAS 17, applying IFRS 16 has a positive impact on EBITDA (as defined in Note 5.1) as well as, to a lesser extent, on trading profit, and a negative impact on finance costs. ----- Consolidated net profit may be reduced progressively over successive periods because total rental expense is generally higher at the beginning of the lease and decreases over time, unlike the straight-line charge recognised under the previous standard (IAS 17). Additionally, net cash from operating activities is higher as cash outflows corresponding to the repayment of the principal amount of the lease liability and related interest payments as classified within cash flows from financing activities. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented on separate lines of the consolidated statement of financial position. Lease liabilities are not included in the calculation of net debt, the definition of which remains unchanged. Accordingly, applying IFRS 16 has the effect of decreasing net debt due to the restatement of finance lease liabilities, which were included within “Loans and borrowings” under IAS 17. The Group has decided to apply IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the retrospective transition approach, by restating all comparative information presented in accordance with IAS 8 – _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting _Estimates and Errors._ The Group has chosen to apply the recognition exemptions in IFRS 16 concerning: ‐ short-term leases (less than 12 months); and ‐ leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (value of underlying leased asset less than €5,000). Lease payments not included in the initial measurement of the financial liability (for example, variable lease payments) are recorded in operating expense, together with payments for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The assets and finance lease liabilities previously classified under IAS 17 within property, plant and equipment and borrowings have been reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, respectively, except for those related to short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Lease premiums previously classified within intangible assets have been reclassified to “Right-of-use assets”. Rightof-use assets relating to lease premiums are not generally amortised and are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. Sale-and-leaseback transactions prior to 1 January 2019 have not been restated, in accordance with IFRS 16. A net deferred tax effect has been recorded for the difference between the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities within the scope of IFRS 16, as was previously the case for finance lease liabilities. The discount rate used to calculate the value of right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities is determined on a countryby-country basis, depending on the lease term. It is calculated for each asset according to the duration of the lease, using the incremental borrowing rate at inception of the lease. The lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, plus (or minus) periods covered by an option to extend (terminate) the lease when that option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For property leases, the Group determined whether it was reasonably certain to exercise any options to extend (terminate) the leases based mainly on the characteristics of the various leased assets (store formats, warehouses and administrative buildings) and the countries concerned by the leases. For “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France, French law grants lessees the right to extend the lease upon expiry of the lease contract, or the right to eviction compensation (indemnité d’éviction). If the lessor is required to pay the lessee more-than-insignificant compensation in the event it refuses to extend the lease, questions arise as to whether or not the lessee effectively has an extension option. In this respect, the Group has applied the position set out by the French accounting standards-setter (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) in its 16 February 2018 statement of conclusions. The enforceable term of such leases is therefore nine years; beyond this, the lease term adopted in accordance with IFRS 16 for automatically renewable leases corresponds to the notice period (generally six months). On 16 December 2019, the IFRS IC published its decision on a request for clarification regarding the following issues: ‐ determining the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease, or an indefinite-term lease that can be terminated by one of the parties subject to a specified notice period. The question related to the notion of penalties used as a basis to define the enforceable period; ‐ the link between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the IFRS 16 lease term. The IFRS IC: ‐ concluded that the broader economics of the lease, and not only its contractual provisions, should be considered in determining the enforceable period of the lease; ‐ provided a number of clarifications regarding the link between the IFRS 16 lease term and the useful life of nonremovable leasehold improvements. In light of the IFRS IC’s final decision, the Group has begun a further analysis of its leases in order to identify contracts whose initial accounting under IFRS 16 could be affected. In view of the large number of leases and the publication of this decision late in the year, Casino did not apply the decision when preparing its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019, since the potential impact of the guidance is still being analysed. ----- The Group’s analyses are focusing particularly on: ‐ automatically renewable leases or leases that can be terminated at any time; ‐ assets under lease (stores, warehouses), including non-removable leasehold improvements, whose residual net carrying amount at the end of the IFRS 16 lease term could give rise to a significant penalty (within the meaning of the IFRS IC decision) for the Group. These cases could lead the Group to adopt a longer IFRS 16 lease term and/or to re-estimate the useful life of the related non-removable leasehold improvements. Following certain industry discussions and on completion of these analyses, which are expected to be finalised ahead of the 2020 interim financial statements, the Group will be able to decide whether or not this IFRS IC decision significantly modifies its current application of IFRS 16 and/or whether the useful life of the related non-removable leasehold improvements should be re-estimated. In particular, these analyses could call into question the IFRS 16 lease term adopted for “3-6-9”-type leases in France (several thousand contracts concerned), which are currently recognised in accordance with the position published by the ANC in February 2018. It should be noted that the 2019 published financial statements of Group subsidiary GPA applied this IFRS IC decision. In light of the principle whereby the consolidated financial statements are prepared using consistent accounting methods from one year to the next, and pending the findings of the analyses currently in progress for the Group as a whole, the impact of this decision is not reflected in the Group’s financial statements. This impact is essentially limited to an increase in lease liabilities and in right-of-use assets of €188 million and €170 million, respectively, at 31 December 2019. The table below provides a summary of the impact of applying IFRS 16 on the 2019 and 2018 consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of financial position:",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The initial scope of the plan, i.e., €1.5 billion, was increased in March and then in August 2019, and now stands at €4.5 billion. On 31 December 2019, transactions carried out under the plan amounted to €2,100 million, of which €1,105 million in 2018 (the sale of 15% of Mercialys through an equity swap for €213 million, the acquisition by Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance of shares in GreenYellow for €150 million and the sale-leaseback of Monoprix real estate assets for €742 million). The main transactions in 2019 included: -   the sale-leaseback on 8 March 2019 of 13 Géant Casino, 3 Hyper Casino and 10 Casino Supermarkets store properties to funds managed by Fortress for a consideration of €392 million; a variable component was recognised in the consolidated financial statements in this respect for €33 million. The transaction includes a variable component whereby the Casino Group could receive up to an additional €120 million depending mainly on the future yield on the properties sold. The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing annual rent of €32 million; -   the sale-leaseback on 15 October 2019 of 31 store properties (12 Géant Casino and 19 Monoprix and Casino Supermarkets stores) valued at €465 million, to funds managed by companies affiliated with Apollo Global Management. The consideration for the transfer of 30 assets totals €327 million and includes a variable component whereby the Casino Group could receive up to an additional €120 million. The Group will continue to operate these 31 stores under leases representing annual rent of €27 million. These two sale-leaseback transactions generated a capital loss before tax of €25 million (after adjusting for the impact of IFRS 16), presented in “Other operating expenses”. Casino sold its contract catering services subsidiary R2C at the end of June 2019. This transaction had no material impact on the financial statements. On 22 July 2019 the Casino Group announced the signing of an agreement to sell Vindémia for an enterprise value of €219 million. On 20 March 2020, Casino announced the signing of an agreement with Aldi to sell Leader Price in France for an enterprise value of €735 million, including a €35 million earn-out contingent (see below and Note 15).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The proceedings were initiated after the court acknowledged the financial difficulties experienced by the holding companies. They have the effect of freezing these companies’ financial liabilities. Each proceeding only concerns the entity for which it was initiated and none of them applies to either Casino, GuichardPerrachon or its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Casino Group continues to run its operations as usual and remains focused on executing the strategic plan announced to the market in June 2018, including the €4.5 billion disposal plan of nonstrategic assets, a sharp reduction in the Group’s debt in France and the achievement of the business objectives communicated to the market. ----- The initiation of safeguard proceedings for Rallye has had notably two impacts at the level of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon: ‐ rating downgrades by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. On 28 May 2019, Standard & Poor's downgraded the Group’s credit rating to B/negative watch (from BB/negative outlook). On 31 May 2019, Moody’s downgraded Casino’s credit rating to B1/negative outlook (from Ba3/negative outlook); ‐ a reduction in the outstanding amount under the Negotiable European commercial paper (“NEU CP”) programme. On 25 November 2019, Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris announced that the safeguard period was to be extended for a further six months with the aim of obtaining court approval for their plans by the end of first-quarter 2020 at the latest. On 2 March 2020, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was informed by its lead shareholder Rallye that on 28 February, the Paris commercial court approved the safeguard plans for Rallye and its subsidiaries Cobivia, HMB and Alpétrol, and for their parent companies, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris (Note 15).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The refinancing plan included two transactions: ‐ raising €1.8 billion of secured financing via (i) a €1.0 billion term loan (“Term Loan B”) bearing interest at Euribor (floored at 0) plus 5.5%, and (ii) a high-yield 5.875% bond issue for €800 million, with both borrowings falling due in January 2024; ‐ extending €2.0 billion of confirmed credit lines in France as a new confirmed revolving credit facility (“RCF”) maturing in October 2023, or in October 2022 if the bond tranche maturing in January 2023 has not been refinanced at that date. The interest on this facility varies depending on the ratio of loans and borrowings to EBITDA (Note 11.5.4). This facility covers the France Retail and E-commerce segments and is subject to maintenance covenants tested quarterly as from 31 March 2020 (Note 11.5.4). Term Loan B and the secured high-yield bond enabled the Group to finance the tender offer on the bonds maturing in 2020, 2021 and 2022 for a total cash amount of €806 million, to repay the drawn credit lines to date for a total amount of €630 million, to repay 50% (i.e., €198 million) of the Segisor loan, and to pay the fees and commissions related to the transaction. The remaining amount was placed in escrow (Note 6.8.1) to be used solely to pay down loans and borrowings. On 9 March 2020 it was used to redeem a bond issue for €271 million (including interest). On 22 October 2019, Standard & Poor’s decided to maintain its B rating for Casino and for the bonds issued under its EMTN program, and to upgrade its negative watch rating to a negative outlook. S&P’s also decided to maintain its CCC rating for deeply-subordinated perpetual bonds (TSSDI) and to assign a B+/negative outlook rating to the secured highyield bond issue and Term Loan B.

Also, 36 loss-making integrated stores have been closed since 2018. Together, these stores represented net sales of around €483 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €39 million. The gain in trading profit on these stores on a full-year basis including the associated structural costs will therefore be around €50 million.

This involved: ‐ an all-cash tender offer launched by GPA for 100% of Éxito’s shares, to which Casino tendered all of its stake (55%); ‐ the acquisition by Casino of the shares held by Éxito in Segisor (which itself held 99.9% of the voting rights and 37% of the economic rights of GPA); ‐ the migration of GPA shares to the Novo Mercado B3 listing segment, with the conversion of preferred shares (PN) into ordinary shares (ON) at an exchange ratio of 1:1, bringing an end to the existence of two classes of shares and giving GPA access to a broader base of international investors. The migration was completed at the beginning of March 2020. ----- The operation was accounted for as an internal reorganization and for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, as a transaction between non-controlling interests. The impact on the consolidated financial statements can be summarised as follows: ‐ changes in the shareholdings in the different subsidiaries (GPA, Éxito, Libertad and Disco/Devoto) are recognised in equity and represented a negative €931 million impact, including a negative €25 million impact arising from transaction fees (see the consolidated statement of changes in equity); - transaction fees are included in “Other operating expenses” for €36 million (Note 6.5) and in equity for the portion directly attributable to the acquisition of non-controlling interests in Éxito through the public tender offer by GPA, representing €25 million net of tax; - in cash flow terms, the transaction led to a cash outflow of €917 million relating to the acquisition of non-controlling interests (41%) in Éxito (Note 4.8); the transaction also enabled the Group to repay the Segisor loan in an amount of €198 million (Note 11.2.2). The transaction increased GAP’s debt and decreased Éxito’s debt (Note 11.2.2, points (i) and (ii)). Upon completion of this transaction, Casino held 41% of the share capital and voting rights of GPA, which in turn held 97% of Éxito’s share capital. Éxito remains the majority shareholders of the Group’s subsidiaries in Argentina (mainly Libertad with a 100% interest) and Uruguay (mainly Disco and Devoto in which it holds 62.5% and 100%, respectively, of the economic rights).

The transaction was carried out through a block sale on the market at the price of BRL 4.90 per share, representing a total sale price of BRL 2.3 billion (€517 million). Taking into account the two total return swaps (TRS) entered into during the first half of 2019, the total proceeds received from the sale of the stake in Via Varejo amounted to BRL 2.7 billion (€615 million). These transactions led to the recognition of a capital gain after tax of BRL 21 million (€6 million), presented under “Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations” (Note 3.5.2). The sale decreased non-controlling interests by €742 million (see note (vii) to the consolidated statement of changes in equity).

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2927,SUMMARISED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE MAIN SUBSIDIARIES WITH MATERIAL NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS,2927.112,Accounting principles,2927.112.1,,"Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all material subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over which the parent company exercises control, joint control or significant influence, either directly or indirectly (see list of consolidated companies in Note 17). SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group (i) has power over the entity, (ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date when control is acquired to the date at which the Group no longer exercises control. All controlled companies are fully consolidated in the Group’s statement of financial position, regardless of the percentage interest held. POTENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS Control is assessed by taking potential voting rights into account, but only if they are substantive; that is, if the entity has the practical ability to exercise its rights with respect to the exercise price, date and terms. The Group may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible into ordinary shares or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give the Group voting power or reduce another party’s voting power over the financial and operational policies of an entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group has control of another entity. Potential voting rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the occurrence of a future event. JOINT VENTURES A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that exercise joint control over an entity have rights to its net assets. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control over an entity, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. ASSOCIATES Associates are companies in which the Group exercises significant influence over financial and operational policies without having control. They are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING The equity method provides that an investment in an associate or a joint venture be recognised initially at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted by the Group’s share in profit or loss and, where appropriate, in other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Goodwill related to these entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any impairment losses and gains or losses on disposal of investments in equityaccounted entities are recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses"". Profits/losses from internal acquisitions or disposals with equity-accounted associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s percentage interest in these companies. In the absence of any guidance in IFRS concerning cases where the amount to be eliminated is greater than the carrying amount of the investment in the equity-accounted company, the Group has elected to cap the amount eliminated from the accounts in the transaction year and to deduct the uneliminated portion from its share of the equity-accounted company's profits in subsequent years. The Group follows a transparent approach to accounting for associates under the equity method and takes into account, if relevant, its final percentage interest in the associate for the purpose of determining the proportion of profit (loss) to be eliminated. In the absence of any standard or interpretation covering dilution of the Group’s interest in a subsidiary of an equityaccounted company, the dilution impact is recognised in the Group’s share of the profit (loss) of the equityaccounted investee. ----- Business combinations As required by IFRS 3 revised, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) in a business combination is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred on the date of the transaction. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in ""Other operating expenses"", except for those related to the issue of equity instruments. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each business combination, the Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case, the amount of goodwill is limited to the portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method. Under the full goodwill method, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value and goodwill is recognised on the full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial goodwill method, which was the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3. In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is remeasured at fair value at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the previouslyheld interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses""). The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the information needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new information obtained by the buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted after the measurement period (not exceeding 12 months from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent acquisitions of non-controlling interests do not give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill. Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair value, whatever the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration due to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded by adjusting goodwill if they occur during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss for the period under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses"" if they arise after the measurement period, unless the obligation is settled in equity instruments. In that case, the contingent consideration is not remeasured subsequently. Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the following principle: ‐ the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is eliminated in full from the accounts of the acquirer; ‐ non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a corresponding adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total equity. Costs and expenses related to intra-group transfers of shares and to internal restructuring in general are included in ""Other operating expenses"". Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the Group’s parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their financial transactions are measured in that currency. The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent company are translated using the closing rate method, as follows: - assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated into euros at the closing rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date; - income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the period unless significant variances occur. The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on translation of the net investment in the operation concerned at successive reporting dates are reclassified to profit or loss. Because the Group applies the step-by-step method of consolidation, the cumulative translation differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if the foreign operation disposed is part of a sub-group. This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the sub group. Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and the resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement under ""Foreign currency exchange gains"" or ""Foreign currency exchange losses"". Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction date. ----- Exchange differences arising on translation of the net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a separate component of equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. Exchange differences arising on translation of (i) foreign currency borrowings hedging a net investment denominated in a foreign currency or (ii) permanent advances made to subsidiaries are also recognised in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. In accordance with IAS 29, the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies are (i) restated to take account of changes in the general purchasing power of the local currency, using official price indices applicable on the reporting date, and (ii) converted into euros at the exchange rate on the reporting date. The Group has qualified Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy since 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Under the terms of the transaction, the Group received immediate proceeds amounting to €213 million before disposal costs (€209 million after disposal costs). Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank. Consequently, the shares were not derecognised at 31 December 2018 and a liability was recorded for €198 million corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market (at the price sold to the bank). The sale of the shares and the related capital gains or losses are recognised when the bank sells the shares on the market. The 1% of shares sold by the bank and recognised in the income statement was not material. As of 31 December 2019, 64.6% of the shares underlying the TRS had been sold. A corresponding capital loss of €20 million was recorded in ""Other operating expenses"" and the liability now stands at €102 million. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 30.6% interest in Mercialys at 31 December 2019 (39.2% at 31 December 2018) on an equity-accounted basis, of which 5.3% corresponds to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank. In addition, the remaining portion of the shares unsold under the TRS continues to be classified as “Assets held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5, recognised at their carrying amount for €46 million at 31 December 2019 (€114 million at 31 December 2018). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Sarenza’s contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from 30 April 2018 to 31 December 2018 was €97 million.

The Group considers that it exercises significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the Mercialys group. This position is based on (a) the absence of a majority vote on strategic decisions at meetings of the company's Board of Directors, which is mostly made up of independent directors, (b) the governance rules stipulating that Casino's representatives on the Mercialys Board may not take part in decisions concerning transactions carried out with the Group, (c) business contracts entered into between the Group and Mercialys on an arm's length basis, and (d) an analysis of the votes cast at recent shareholders’ meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related parties do not control shareholder decisions at shareholders’ meetings). The percentage interest is 31% and 39% respectively at 31 December 2019 and 2018. (ii) Tuya was set up in partnership with Éxito and Bancolombia to manage the banking services offered to customers of the stores in Colombia, primarily the possibility of signing up for credit cards in the stores. The partnership structure changed in October 2016 when Éxito became a 50% shareholder of Tuya. (iii) FIC was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco SA (“Itaú Unibanco”) to finance purchases by GPA's customers. It is accounted for using the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over its operating and financial policies. (iv) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of Tuya (interest held by the Éxito sub-group) and FIC (interest held by GPA). Following the sale of Via Varejo, GPA now holds 36% of FIC’s share capital and voting rights (42% and 50%, respectively, at end-2018). (v) The current assets of Banque du Groupe Casino, Tuya and FIC primarily concern their credit business. (vi) Stock dividends worth COP 20 billion (€6 million) paid to the joint venture partners.

In both 2019 and 2018, the related management fees amounted to €6 million. ‐ Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by Casino’s Board of Directors on 19 June 2012 and an addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership’s fundamental principle whereby Casino develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth has been maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects offering satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to propose new projects that will be examined by Casino and tracked during monitoring committee meetings. Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary permits have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of projected rental revenues. The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on the basis of (i) a rent capitalisation rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by reference to the rates used to value Mercialys’ portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the project. Under the new agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to 10% – may also be taken into account for pricing purposes. The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has been maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed. For example, the price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside) difference between the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at the outset. The contracts require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process. In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that could lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group’s food stores. At the end of January 2017, the partnership agreement was extended by three years, until end-2020. ‐ Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, finance/accounting, IT and real estate support services to Mercialys. In 2019, the related fees amounted to €2 million (2018: €2 million). ‐ Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real estate portfolio enhancement specialists. This agreement had no material impact in 2019 or 2018. The parties decided to terminate the agreement on 31 December 2018. A new fixed-term agreement has been signed with an initial term of six months (1 January to 30 June 2019), covering asset management services provided by Mercialys’ teams on projects managed on Casino’s behalf. The agreement is automatically renewable for successive six-month terms up to a maximum of 48 months in total. ‐ Sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. ‐ Current account agreement: on 8 September 2005, Mercialys entered into a current account and cash management agreement with Casino. Under this agreement, Mercialys and Casino set up a shareholder current account for all eligible payments, withdrawals or advances of funds between the two companies. Following the reduction in Casino’s interest in Mercialys’ share capital in 2012, the two parties decided to terminate the existing current account and cash management agreement and to enter into a new current account agreement. This agreement maintained Mercialys’ current account with Casino, enabling it to benefit from cash advances of up to €50 million from Casino. The term of the agreement was extended on several occasions and expired on 31 December 2019. An addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2019, reducing the cash advance limit to €35 million. This amended agreement will expire on 31 December 2021. ‐ The Annual General Meeting of 25 April 2019 approved a related-party agreement between Mercialys and Casino, Guichard-Perrachon, pursuant to which Casino agreed to bear the specific costs incurred by Mercialys in connection with the sale by Casino, Guichard-Perrachon of all or some of its shares in Mercialys.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Group has decided to apply two different accounting methods for these NCI puts, depending on whether they were granted before or after 1 January 2010, as recommended by France's securities regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers): - NCI puts granted before the effective date of IAS 27 revised are accounted for using the goodwill method whereby the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests is recognised in goodwill. In subsequent years, this liability is remeasured and any changes adjust goodwill. - NCI puts granted since IAS 27 revised came into effect are accounted for as transactions between shareholders, with the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests recognised as a deduction from equity.

A non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion of a sale within one year of the date of this classification. Considering these characteristics, net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction from net debt (Note 11). Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and: - represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when the operation is disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for sale. When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of cash flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as from the first day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated income statement, “Profit from discontinued operations”, which includes the net profit or loss of the discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment loss recognised to write down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or any after-tax disposal gains or losses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Most of the amount reported under Group “Net sales” corresponds to revenue included in the scope of IFRS 15. “Other revenue"" consists of revenue from the property development and property trading businesses, rental revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and revenues from the energy business. The majority of amounts reported under “Other revenue” are included in the scope of IFRS 15, while rental revenues are included in the scope of IFRS 16. Revenue is measured at the contract price, corresponding to the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of goods or services. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, which represent the units of account for revenue recognition purposes. Revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of the good or service passes to the customer. Revenue may therefore be recognised at a specific point in time or over time based on the stage of completion. The Group’s main sources of revenue are as follows: - Sales of goods (including through the property trading business): in this case, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, that of delivering the good to the customer. Revenue from these sales is recognised when control of the good is transferred to the customer upon delivery, i.e., generally: - at the checkout for in-store sales, - on receipt of the goods by the franchisee or affiliated store; - on receipt of the goods by the customer for e-commerce sales. - Sales of services, for example sales of subscriptions, franchising fees, logistics services, rental revenue and property management services: in this case, for operations included in the scope of IFRS 15, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, to supply the service, and the related revenues are recognised over the period in which the services are performed. - Property development revenues: in this case, the Group generally has several performance obligations, some of which may be satisfied at a given point in time and others over time based on the project’s percentage of completion. Profit from property development activities is generally calculated on a percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the projected margin on completion weighted by the percentage of completion determined by the inputs method. - Revenues from the energy business, for which the Group generally identifies a performance obligation when the solar power plant is delivered (in exchange for variable consideration in some cases) or when the energy performance contracts are sold. The Group also sells energy services for which the related revenue is recognised when the service is performed. The vast majority of revenues are recognised at a given point in time. ----- If settlement of the consideration is deferred for an unusually long time and no promise of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms, revenue is recognised by adjusting the consideration for the effects of the time value of money. If significant, the difference between this price and the unadjusted transaction price is recognised in ""Other financial income"" over the payment deferral period, determined using the effective interest method. The Group operates loyalty programmes that enable customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future purchases.

Based on this definition, a receivable does not constitute a contract asset. The Group recognises a contract asset when it has fulfilled all or part of its performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to payment (i.e., the Group does not yet have the right to invoice the customer). In light of its business, contract assets recognised by the Group are not material. - A contract liability corresponds to an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. The Group recognises contract liabilities mainly for award credits granted under its loyalty programmes, advances received and sales for which all or part of the performance obligation has not yet been fulfilled (e.g., sales of subscriptions and gift cards, and future performance obligations of the property development business for which the customer has already been invoiced followed by payment of consideration). - The incremental costs to obtain a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained and which it expects to recover. The costs to fulfil a contract are costs related directly to a contract that generate or enhance the resources that will be used by the Group in satisfying its performance obligations and which it expects to recover. For the Group, the costs to obtain and fulfil contracts correspond primarily to the costs incurred in connection with its franchising and affiliation business. These costs are capitalised and amortised over the life of the franchise or affiliation contract. The capitalised amounts are tested regularly for impairment (Note 1.3). Contract assets and the costs to obtain and fulfil contracts are tested for impairment under IFRS 9.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Other changes in scope of consolidation relate mainly to the France Retail and Latam Retail segments and include fees of €36 million arising on the reorganisation of operations in Latin America.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis takes into account the business unit's operating environment and the type, age, turnover characteristics and sales pattern of the products concerned. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by the GPA sub-group which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA’s inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method was applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in the carrying amount together with supplier discounts deducted from ""Cost of goods sold"". The cost of inventories also includes gains or losses on cash flow hedges of future inventory purchases initially accumulated in equity.

The Group applies the simplified approach for the measurement of expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables, which are determined based on credit losses observed for receivables with the same profile, as adjusted to take into account forward-looking factors such as the customer’s credit status or the economic environment.

They can also include the value of a purchase option or estimated early termination penalties, when Casino is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Any lease incentives receivable at the lease commencement date are deducted from the fixed lease payments; ‐ right-of-use assets are recognised for the value of the lease liabilities, less any lease incentives received from the lessor, plus any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in respect of any contractual restoration obligations. The Group only includes the lease component of the contract when measuring its lease liabilities.

Lease liabilities are: ‐ increased by interest expenses, as calculated by applying a discount rate to the liabilities at the start of the financial period. These interest expenses are recognised in the income statement within “Other financial expenses”; ‐ reduced by any lease payments made. Cash payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities along with cash payments for the interest portion of those liabilities are included within net cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured against right-of-use assets to reflect any lease modifications and in the event of: ‐ changes in the lease term; ‐ changes in the assessment of whether or not a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised; ‐ changes in amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee granted to the lessor; ‐ changes in variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate when the index or rate adjustment takes effect (i.e., when the lease payments are effectively modified). In the first two cases, lease liabilities are remeasured using a discount rate as revised at the remeasurement date. In the last two cases, the discount rate used to measure the lease liabilities on initial recognition remains unchanged. Right-of-use assets are measured using the amortised cost model as from the lease commencement date and over the estimated term of the lease. This gives rise to the recognition of a straight-line depreciation expense in the income statement. Right-of-use assets are reduced by any impairment losses recognised in accordance with IAS 36 (Note 10.5) and are readjusted in line with the remeasurement of lease liabilities. In the event a lease is terminated early, any gains or losses arising as a result of derecognising the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are taken to the income statement within other operating income or other operating expenses. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

In estimating the reasonably certain term of a lease, the Group considers all of the characteristics associated with the leased assets (local laws and regulations, location, category – e.g., stores, warehouses, offices, apartments, property/equipment leases, expected useful life, etc.). Under leases of store properties, the Group may also consider economic criteria such as the store format, the longterm nature and performance of the leased assets, and whether or not significant recent investments have been made in the stores. Generally, the term of warehouses and office leases along with equipment leases corresponds to the initial term provided for in the lease contract. More specifically, for “3-6-9”-type commercial leases in France, the Group recognises a term of nine years as the maximum enforceable period of the lease at the lease commencement date, in accordance with the ANC’s 16 February 2018 position statement. Certain leases may be automatically renewable.

Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. - **Under defined benefit plans, the Group's obligation is measured using the projected unit credit method based on the agreements effective in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to measure the obligation vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the relevant country. The obligation is measured by independent actuaries annually for the most significant plans and for the employment termination benefit, and regularly for all other plans. Assumptions include expected rate of future salary increases, estimated average years of service, life expectancy and staff turnover rates (based on resignations only). Actuarial gains and losses arise from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (differences between results based on previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred). All actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Past service cost, corresponding to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from the introduction of a new benefit plan or modification of an existing plan, is expensed immediately. The expense in the income statement comprises: - service cost, i.e., the cost of services provided during the year, recognised in trading profit; - past service cost and the effect of plan curtailments or settlements, generally recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses""; - interest cost, corresponding to the discounting adjustment to the projected benefit obligation net of the return on plan assets, recorded in ""Other financial income and expenses"". Interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate defined in IAS 19 to the net obligation (i.e., the projected obligation less related plan assets) recognised in respect of defined benefit plans, as determined at the beginning of the year. The provision recognised in the statement of financial position is measured as the net present value of the obligation less the fair value of plan assets.

At 31 December 2019, the estimated amount was €44 million (31 December 2018: €38 million). Moreover, Casino has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax adjustments received from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,409 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: BRL 1,317 million), including penalties and interest. Under the terms of the guarantee, Casino has undertaken to indemnify GPA for 50% of any damages incurred, provided those damages are definitive. Based on the commitment given by Casino to its subsidiary, the risk exposure amounts to BRL 705 million (€156 million) 31 December 2018: (BRL 658 million, representing €148 million). As the risks of liability are only considered possible, Casino has not recognised a provision in its financial statements for this amount. - **GPA contingent assets Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base Since the adoption of the non-cumulative regime of PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has challenged the right to deduct ICMS taxes from the calculation basis for PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by a Brazilian federal supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the PIS and COFINS tax base. Since the supreme court’s ruling on 15 March 2017, the procedure has continued in line with the expectations of GPA and its advisors, without GPA’s judgement being called into question concerning the reversal of the provisions, although the court has not yet handed down its final decision. GPA and its external legal advisors believe that this decision concerning the application method will not limit its rights under the legal proceedings brought since 2003 which are still in progress. However, an asset cannot be recognised for the tax credits until all the stages in the procedure have been completed. GPA estimates that these tax credits represent a potential asset of BRL 1,184 million (€262 million). ----- #### Note 14 Related-party transactions Related parties are: - parent companies (mainly Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris); - entities that exercise joint control or significant influence over the Company; - subsidiaries (Note 17); - associates (primarily Mercialys) (Note 3.3); - joint ventures (Note 3.3); - members of the Board of Directors and Management Committee (Note 8.4). The Company has relations with all of its subsidiaries in its day-to-day management of the Group. The Company and its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice and assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris (provision of staff and premises). The expenses recorded during the year in respect of these agreements with Casino and its subsidiaries totalled €4.1 million, of which €3.5 million for strategic advisory services and €0.6 million for the provision of staff and premises. In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities, Casino and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys (Note 3.3.6). Related-party transactions with individuals (Directors, corporate officers and members of their families) are not material. #### Note 15 Subsequent events - **Vesa Equity Investment On 20 January 2020, Vesa Equity Investment announced that it had crossed the 5%-threshold of Casino, GuichardPerrachon’s share capital to reach 5.64% of the capital. - **Rallye safeguard plan On 2 March 2020, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon was informed by its lead shareholder Rallye that on 28 February, the Paris commercial court approved the safeguard plans for Rallye and its subsidiaries. - **Covid-19 First identified in the Asia-Pacific region, the Covid-19 epidemic has spread rapidly to the rest of the world during the first few months of 2020, prompting governments to take drastic health measures to control the spread of the virus (closure of schools, lockdowns, travel and mobility restrictions, closure of public places, etc.). These measures are having a huge economic impact in every country in which the Group operates and it is currently impossible to predict how long the measures will be in place or their ultimate impact on business and the economy. Sales have increased sharply due to panic buying and the fact that people can no longer eat in restaurants and canteens, and are eating all their meals at home. Given the uncertainty surrounding both future consumer behaviour trends and the pandemic’s economic impact, it would nevertheless be premature to estimate Covid-19’s financial impact on the Group at this stage. - **Signature of an agreement with Aldi France to sell Leader Price stores and warehouses On 20 March 2020, the Casino Group announced it had signed a unilateral purchase agreement with Aldi France to sell 567 Leader Price stores and 3 warehouses for an enterprise value of €735 million (including an earn-out of €35 million contingent on the achievement of certain operating indicators during the transaction period). The Group remains owner of the Leader Price brand and will continue to distribute Leader Price-branded products to the Group’s other banners and franchisees, particularly outside France. The transaction is expected to be completed after consultation with employee representative bodies and is subject to approval by the French Competition Authority. ----- #### Note 16 Statutory Auditors' fees",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The agreement also states that Éxito is the sole provider of property management, administrative and marketing services for Viva Malls and that it is paid an arm’s length fee for these services. A review of the substance of FIC's rights under the agreement confirms that their effect is solely to protect FIC's investment and that, consequently, Viva Malls is controlled by Éxito.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, as approved in the above-mentioned context, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. ----- |Measurement of assets and liabilities held for sale and of the result of the discontinued Leader Price operations|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 2 “Significant events” and Note 3.5 “Assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements|| |As at 31 December 2019, the Leader Price assets and liabilities held for sale amount to 1,362 and 706 million euros respectively, representing net assets amounting to 656 million euros (approximately 8% of consolidated shareholders’ equity), and are measured at the lower of their net carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. The result of the discontinued Leader Price operations in respect of financial year 2019 is a loss of 1,047 million euros. Taking into account the contribution represented by the Leader Price operations in the consolidated financial statements and the significance of Management’s estimates underlying the determination of: (i) The Leader Price assets and liabilities to be presented as assets and liabilities held for sale, including in particular the allocation of the goodwill of the Franprix Leader Price group of cash generating units to the Leader Price operations; (ii) The fair value less costs to sell used by the Group’s Management for the net assets attributable to the Leader Price operations within the context of the sale process in progress and the proposed conditions. The fair value used led the Group to recognize impairment in the amount of 704 million euros for financial year 2019, we considered the measurement of the Leader Price net assets held for sale and the result of the corresponding discontinued operations to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit: - We gained an understanding of the method of allocation of the Franprix Leader Price goodwill to the activities of Franprix, Leader Price and Geimex, which is based on the relative values of each of these activities, and we assessed the compliance of this method with IAS 36. We assessed the bases on which these relative values were established and verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations made; - We analyzed the conditions of allocation of other assets and liabilities and the result of the Franprix Leader Price operations to the Leader Price activities, as well as the underlying agreements used by Management to perform certain allocations, in particular those concerning the shared services between Franprix and Leader Price; - We assessed Management’s estimates necessary for determining the fair value less expected costs to sell based on i) the information available at this stage of the sale process and ii) the conditions envisaged by Management, together with the buyer, for the implementation of the sale; - We verified the methodology of calculation of the impairment loss. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| ----- |Impairment tests of goodwill and brands|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 3 “Consolidation scope”, Note 10.1 “Goodwill”, Note 10.2 “Other intangible assets” and Note 10.5 “Impairment of non-current assets” to the consolidated financial statements|| |As at 31 December 2019, the net carrying amounts of goodwill and brands with an indefinite useful life recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position amount to 7,489 and 1,509 million euros respectively, i.e. approximately 26% of total consolidated assets. Within the context of the valuation of these assets, the Group allocates its goodwill and brands to the groups of cash generating units (CGUs) as described in Note 10.1.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the implementation of impairment tests. In 2019, these CGUs take into account the reorganization performed by the Group in France, which led to dividing the Franprix- Leader Price group of CGUs into three groups of CGUs: Franprix, Leader Price and Geimex. The impairment tests are performed at least once a year and whenever a trigger for impairment is identified, according to the conditions described in Notes 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 to the consolidated financial statements. We considered the valuation of goodwill and brands to be a key audit matter due to the following: - Their materiality in the consolidated financial statements; - The significance of the estimates notably used as a basis for the determination of their recoverable amount, including turnover and margin rate forecasts for these activities, the perpetual growth rates used to determine terminal value, and discount rates; - The sensitivity of the valuation of these recoverable amounts to certain assumptions.|We assessed the compliance of the methodology implemented by Management with the accounting standards in force. We also assessed the main estimates used, analyzing the following in particular: - The consistency of cash flow projections with the budgets and medium-term business plans prepared by Management, as well as the consistency of the turnover and margin rates with the Group’s historical performance, in the economic context in which the Group operates; - The methods and parameters used to determine the discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to estimated cash flows. With the assistance of the valuation specialists included in our audit team, we recalculated these discount rates using the most recent market data available and compared the results obtained with (i) the rates used by Management and (ii) the rates observed for several players operating in the same business sector as the Group; - The sensitivity scenarios adopted by Management, of which we verified the arithmetical accuracy. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in particular that relating to sensitivity tests.| ----- |First-time application of IFRS 16 “Leases”|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 1.3 “Changes in accounting methods and restatement of comparative information” and Note 7 “Leases” to the consolidated financial statements|| |The Group applies IFRS 16 “Leases” as from 1 January 2019, retrospectively for each prior period for which it presents financial information. The comparative information relating to the previous financial year has thus been restated and the cumulative effect has been recognized as at 1 January 2018. The first-time application of the standard has led to presenting, as at 1 January 2018, right-of-use assets for a net value of 4,491 million euros and lease liabilities amounting to 4,150 million euros. As stated in Note 7 “Leases” to the consolidated financial statements, these leases mainly concern real estate assets. We considered the first-time application of IFRS 16, particularly to real estate assets, to be a key audit matter due to the following: - The significance of the accounting impacts related to the first-time application of the standard to these leases in the consolidated accounts; - The volume of the leases to be identified and analyzed within the Group, taking into account the exemptions applied by Management; - The considerable use by Management of estimates, judgments and assumptions, especially in respect of the determination of the non-cancellable period and the discount rate to determine the value of the right- of-use assets and lease liabilities related to the real estate leases based at the date of the start of the lease on the discounted future payments.|Within the scope of our audit: - We gained an understanding of the internal control procedures including in relation to the information system, and tested the key application and manual controls set up by Management to ensure (i) the completeness and accuracy of the contractual data relating to the leases and (ii) the correct valuation of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that we considered the most relevant; - We analyzed and assessed the relevance of the main assumptions used by the Group, especially the discount rate and the lease term, in particular for leases with an extension or termination option, on which the value of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of the real estate is based; - We tested the completeness of the real estate databases used, by analyzing the residual lease costs based, notably, on the exemptions offered by the standard and applied by the Group: leases with a lease term of 12 months or less and leases where the underlying asset has a low value; - We reconciled, for a sample of leases, the information used to determine the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities with the underlying contractual documents; - We recalculated, for a sample of leases, the value of the right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, and compared our results with those of the Group. In addition, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| ----- |Compliance with bank covenants|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 2 “Significant events” and Note 11.5 “Financial risk management objectives and policies” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Certain loan and credit line agreements, as stated in Note 11.5.4 “Liquidity risk” to the consolidated financial statements, provide for the obligation for the Group to comply with bank ratios in respect of the bank covenants as at 31 December 2019. In addition, during the 4th quarter of 2019, the Group finalized its refinancing plan, resulting in the raising of secured funding in the amount of 1.8 billion euros maturing in January 2024 and the extension of confirmed credit lines in France for 2 billion euros as a new confirmed revolving credit facility maturing in October 2023, the latter being subject to bank covenants applicable as from 31 March 2020. Any non-compliance with the bank covenants is liable to result in all or part of the debts concerned being immediately payable. We considered compliance with the bank covenants to be a key audit matter, as any failure to comply with these ratios could have impacts on the availability of the group’s confirmed credit lines as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the presentation of financial liabilities as current / non-current in the consolidated financial statements and, if relevant, the continuation of the company as a going concern.|Within the scope of our audit: - We analyzed the Group’s bond and bank documentation, including in particular the covenants, in order to understand the definition of the ratios; - We gained an understanding of the internal control procedures relating to the monitoring of the Group’s liquidity and net financial debt, including the processes for (i) establishing cash flow forecasts, (ii) monitoring net financial debt and (iii) calculating the ratios and complying with the bank covenants; - We verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculation of the ratios produced by Management as at 31 December 2019. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, notably the information concerning compliance with the covenants relating to the financing concerned.| ----- - The assumptions used by Management to draw up the tax credits recovery plan; - The documentation that evidences either the recognition of ICMS tax over the year, or the characterization of the PIS and COFINS tax credits as contingent assets. |Recognition of tax credits and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 5.1 “Key indicators by reportable sector”, Note 6.8 “Other current assets”, Note 6.9.1 “Breakdown of other non-current assets” and Note 13.3 “Contingent assets and liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Within the scope of its retail activities at GPA, the Group recognizes ICMS tax credits. The balance of the credits recognized amounts to 580 million euros as at 31 December 2019. These tax credits were recognized insofar as GPA considers their recoverability to be probable. In addition, as described in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group estimates contingent PIS and COFINS tax credits related to the exclusion of ICMS from the calculation basis of these two taxes to amount to 262 million euros. GPA is also involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in Brazil arising, notably, from tax claims filed by the Brazilian tax authorities. A part of these tax risks, estimated at 2,165 million euros as at 31 December 2019, were analyzed as contingent liabilities and no provisions were recognized as at 31 December 2019, as stated in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements.|We interviewed the various persons who hold responsibilities in the GPA organization to identify and gain an understanding of the tax credits and existing disputes, as well as the judgments relating thereto. Concerning the tax credits to be received, we analyzed the following items with the assistance of the specialists in Brazilian indirect taxes included in our audit team: - The internal control environment relating to the processes set up by Management to monitor the tax credits and ensure their recoverability, and we tested the related key controls; - The assumptions used by Management to draw up the tax credits recovery plan; - The documentation that evidences either the recognition of ICMS tax over the year, or the characterization of the PIS and COFINS tax credits as contingent assets.| ----- |Recognition of tax credits and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities at GPA (continued)|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |We considered the recognition and recoverability of both the tax credits and the valuation and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities in Brazil to be key audit matters for the following reasons: (i) the significance in the accounts of the tax credit balance, the contingent asset relating to PIS and COFINS tax credits and the amount of contingent tax liabilities as at 31 December 2019, (ii) the complexity of the Brazilian tax legislation related to taxes and (iii) the use of judgements and estimates by Management in connection with the recognition of tax credits and the valuation of the contingent tax liabilities.|Concerning the contingent liabilities, with the assistance of our specialists in Brazilian taxation included in our audit team: - We gained an understanding of the internal control environment relating to the processes for the identification, monitoring and estimation of the level of risk associated with the various disputes, and we tested the related key controls; - We reconciled the list of identified disputes with the information provided by the Brazilian subsidiaries’ main law firms that we contacted in order to assess the existence, completeness and amounts of the disputes; - We examined the information on the legal or technical proceedings and/or opinions provided by the law firms or external experts chosen by Management, in order to assess the correct recognition of the various disputes or their characterization as contingent liabilities; - We reconciled the risk estimates prepared by the Group with the figures relating to contingent tax liabilities disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| ----- - We reconciled the receivables recognized in the balance sheet with the amounts collected subsequent to year-end. |Valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |See Note 6.2 “Cost of goods sold” and Note 6.8 “Other current assets” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Within the scope of its retail activities, the Group receives rebates from its suppliers in the form of discounts and commercial cooperation fees. These rebates, generally paid on the basis of a percentage defined contractually according to purchase volumes and applied to purchases made from suppliers, are recorded as a deduction from cost of goods sold. Considering the material impact of these rebates on net profit for the year, the large number of contracts involved and the necessity for Management to estimate the final rebate percentage determined according to the volume of related purchases for each supplier, we considered the valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit: - We gained an understanding of the internal control environment relating to the processes for the monitoring of these rebates in the Group’s various significant subsidiaries and we carried out tests on the key controls set up by Management; - We reconciled, on a sampling basis, the contractual terms relating to rebates to be received from suppliers with their valuation; - We assessed, on a sampling basis, the estimates used by Management to determine these year-end rebates, in particular the estimation of the volumes of purchases at year-end used to determine the final rebate percentage for each supplier and the amounts of the invoices to be issued; - We reconciled the receivables recognized in the balance sheet with the amounts collected subsequent to year-end.|",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: ----- - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit Committee We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors _(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards. ----- Paris-La Défense, 27 March 2020 The Statutory Auditors _French original signed by_ DELOITTE & ASSOCIES ERNST & YOUNG et Autres Frédéric Moulin Patrice Choquet Yvon Salaün Alexis Hurtrel ----- #### CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended 31 December 2018 ----- ### CONTENTS CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT…………………………………………………………...

The following texts have no material impact on the Group’s financial statements: - _IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration This interpretation is applicable either retrospectively or prospectively. IFRIC 22 provides guidance on interpreting IAS 21 – _The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. It clarifies the exchange rate to be used for advance consideration. - _Amendments to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property These amendments are applicable on a prospective basis. They provide guidance on transfers to or from investment property. They also clarify that the list of evidence of a change of use is a non-exhaustive list of examples. - _IFRS Annual Improvements – 2014-2016 cycle The main standard concerned is IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. These amendments are applicable on a retrospective basis. They clarify that IFRS 12 also applies to interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates classified as “held for sale” in accordance with IFRS 5 (except for the requirement to disclose summary financial information which does not have to be applied). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities hedged by a fair value hedge which would otherwise be measured at cost are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros. The figures in the tables have been rounded to the nearest million euros and include individually rounded data.

Due to the inherent uncertainty of assumptions, actual results may differ from the estimates. Estimates and assessments are reviewed at regular intervals and adjusted where necessary to take into account past experience and any relevant economic factors. The main judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the information available when the financial statements are drawn up and concern the following: - classification and measurement of Via Varejo's net assets, assets within France Retail segment and Mercialys shares in accordance with IFRS 5 (Note 3.5); - valuation of non-current assets and goodwill (Note 10.5); - recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets (Note 9); - recognition, presentation and measurement of the recoverable amounts of tax credits or taxes (mainly ICMS, PIS and COFINS in Brazil) (Notes 5.1, 6.9 and 13); - provisions for risks (Note 13), particularly tax and employee-related risks in Brazil. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2928,DELOITTE & ASSOCIES,2928.42,1.3 Changes in accounting methods 1.3.1 Impact of first-time adoption of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers,2928.42.1,,"IFRS 15 defines the principles for recognising revenue and replaces IAS 18 – _Revenue, IAS 11 –_ _Construction _Contracts and all related interpretations. The standard defines a single model for recognising revenue, in five steps._ It introduces new concepts and principles regarding the recognition of revenue, in particular the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price for contracts with multiple performance obligations. The Group has decided to apply IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018 under the full retrospective approach, by restating comparative information. In view of the nature of the Group’s businesses, the application of the standard had no material impact on the revenue and trading profit previously published by the Group. Adoption of IFRS 15 has mainly led to reclassifications between net sales, other revenue, cost of goods sold and selling expenses. This mainly concerns certain services provided to suppliers, certain promotional offers granted directly by suppliers to end-customers, agent/principal qualifications in certain contracts and the presentation of rental revenue. Retrospective application of IFRS 15 to the 2017 financial statements led to a €332 million decrease in net sales and a €30 million decrease in trading profit (including €19 million in the France Retail segment and €10 million in the E-commerce segment) compared to the previously reported amounts. The amended accounting policy applied to revenue is presented in Note 6.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2928,DELOITTE & ASSOCIES,2928.43,1.3.2 Impact of the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments,2928.43.1,,"IFRS 9 defines new principles covering the classification and measurement of financial instruments, the recognition of impairment provisions for credit risk on financial assets and hedge accounting. The Group has applied IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2018 by recording the cumulative impact in opening equity at the transition date. The main individually non-material changes resulting from the application of IFRS 9 are as follows: - In line with the new impairment model for financial assets (including contract assets), incurred losses recorded under IAS 39 have been replaced by lifetime expected credit losses. The Group has applied the simplified model for all these assets, in particular receivables from franchisees and tenants. With respect to continuing operations excluding equity-accounted investees, application of the new model led to a €51 million increase in provisions for asset impairment and a €35 million reduction in equity, net of tax. - Credit card receivables (Brazil) have been classified as debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, resulting in a €3 million reduction in trade receivables and a €2 million reduction in equity. - Equity instruments previously classified as “Available-for-sale financial assets” have been reclassified mainly as equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss. - Bond swaps have been restated, leading to a €19 million increase in debt and a €15 million reduction in equity, net of tax. - With respect to equity-accounted investees (Mercialys, Banque du Groupe Casino and FIC), an €11 million reduction in equity, net of tax was recognised against equity-accounted investees, mainly due to the application of the new impairment model for financial assets. - With respect to Via Varejo’s discontinued operations, a €47 million reduction in equity, net of tax was recognised against assets held for sale, as a result of the application of the new impairment model for consumer finance receivables and to the classification of credit card receivables as debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. ----- The table below shows the original measurement categories under IAS 39 and the new categories used as from 1 January 2018 under IFRS 9 for each class of financial assets.

IAS 29 requires that the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies should be (i) restated by applying a general price index so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period, and (ii) converted into euros at the period-end exchange rate. Moreover, certain changes have been made to the presentation of the consolidated income statement in connection with the application of IFRS 15. These changes concern (i) the addition of a new indicator, “Total revenue”, representing the sum of “Net sales” and “Other revenue”, (ii) the reclassification of the cost of property development and property trading activities and changes in related inventories from “Selling expenses” to “Cost of goods sold”, and (iii) reclassifications between “Net sales” and “Other revenue” of various items including: - rental revenues, which are now reported under “Other revenue”; - franchising and service fees billed to franchisees, which are now reported under “Net sales”.

Throughout 2018, GPA actively sought to sell the company to strategic investors. However, due to external factors that were beyond GPA’s control, related mainly to the macro-economic environment in Brazil, no potential buyer had been found as of 31 December 2018. While continuing the process of seeking out potential buyers, on 21 December 2018, GPA’s Board of Directors authorised management to explore alternative solutions to enable the sale to be completed before 31 December 2019, including by selling the Via Varejo shares in a series of transactions on the stock market. The process to transfer all Via Varejo shares to the New Market segment of the B3-Brasil Bolsa Balcão stock market was completed in November 2018. In this context, at the end of December 2018, GPA signed an agreement for the sale of 50 million Via Varejo ordinary shares (3.86% of the capital) through a total return swap (TRS) with a leading financial institution with the purpose of subsequently selling the shares on the market over a period ending at the latest on 30 April 2019. The sales were completed ahead of this date, with the last transaction carried out on 20 February. The operation had no impact on the control or governance of Via Varejo. As of 31 December 2018, because the TRS did not meet the requirements for derecognition under IFRS 9, the underlying sale was not recorded in the accounts and a liability was recorded for the €49 million received from the counterparty (Notes 11.2.2 and 11.2.4). As at 31 December 2018, GPA held 39.4% of Via Varejo’s voting rights and 43.23% of the shares. Therefore, the sale of Via Varejo in 2019 is considered highly probable, and in accordance with IFRS 5 – _Non- _current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations:_ - the assets and liabilities held for sale are reported on a separate line of the consolidated statement of financial position (Note 3.5.1); - Via Varejo's net profit and cash flows for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 are reported on separate lines in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows; - Via Varejo has been excluded from tables in the notes, in particular those relative to lease commitments (Note 7.2) and GPA's contingent liabilities (Note 13.3). If necessary, specific information for Via Varejo is provided in a footnote. Pursuant to the authorisation given by its Board of Directors on 20 February 2019, GPA has contracted a second total return swap for 40 million Via Varejo shares (see note 15). - **Bond issue On 24 January 2018, Casino placed a €200 million tap of its bond issue due June 2022, at an effective interest rate of 1.58%. The operation issue raised the total nominal amount of the bond from €550 million to €750 million. - **Acquisition of Sarenza (Note 3.1.1) - **Commercial partnership between Monoprix and Amazon On 26 March 2018, Monoprix and Amazon announced that they were forming a commercial partnership to deliver grocery items sourced from Monoprix to Amazon's Prime service customers in Paris and its inner suburbs. On 12 September 2018, the two partners announced the launch of a dedicated virtual store on the Amazon Prime Now app and website, giving Amazon Prime members access to over 6,000 products with delivery to the address of their choice in less than two hours. ----- - **Announcement of an asset disposal plan On 11 June 2018, the Group announced that it was launching an asset disposal plan to support ongoing transformation of the business model and accelerate the deleveraging process in France. The plan concerned non-strategic real estate and other assets identified by the Group with an estimated total realisable value of €1.5 billion. The objective was for half of the plan to be completed in 2018. As at 31 December 2018, disposals under the plan totalled €1,105 million and included: - sale of 15% of Mercialys shares through an equity swap for €213 million (Note 3.1.4); - entry of Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance into the capital of GreenYellow for €150 million (see below); - sale of Monoprix real estate assets: following the synallagmatic agreements signed on 28 September and 17 October 2018, the Group completed the sale of buildings pertaining to 53 Monoprix stores to Generali Group and 14 stores to AG2R La Mondiale on 20 December 2018. After deducting registration fees, these transactions amounted to €742 million and generated a capital gain of €166 million, net of transaction costs (Note 6.5). The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing an annual rent of €35 million. Indicative offers have also been received for other assets included in the disposal plan, some of which have led to agreements being signed since the beginning of 2019 (Note 15). - **Cooperation in purchasing with Auchan Retail, METRO and the Schiever Group On 29 June 2018, the Casino, Auchan Retail, METRO and Schiever groups announced the signature of several agreements covering their cooperation in purchasing, internationally and in France. Previously, the Casino Group and Auchan Retail had announced on 3 April 2018 that they had begun exclusive talks to build a global strategic partnership. This coincided with Casino and Intermarché’s mutually agreed termination of their purchasing alliance. The Dia group joined the partnership at the end of August 2018. The new alliances, called Horizon, will focus on moving away from purely transactional negotiations towards a collaborative, balanced and innovative type of negotiations. After being granted approval by the relevant competition authorities, Horizon International Services has been up and running since 15 February 2019 and covers 47 countries in Europe, Asia and South America in which these companies operate. - **Bond buybacks A total of €128 million worth of bonds maturing at different dates between 2018 and 2026 were bought back in July and August 2018. The bonds were purchased as and when market opportunities arose, at prices that the Group considered attractive. The transactions were in line with the strategy to pay down gross debt. The impact on the consolidated financial statements was as follows: - reduction in debt, including fair value hedges with a negative fair value: €135 million (Note 11.2.2); - reduction in hedging instruments with a positive fair value: €3 million; - recognition in ""Finance costs, net"" of a €4 million gain (not taking into account future interest savings). - **Rating downgrades On 3 September 2018, Standard & Poor’s announced that it was downgrading Casino’s rating from BB+ Stable outlook to BB Negative outlook. On 28 September 2018, Moody’s announced that it was downgrading Casino’s rating from Ba1, stable outlook to Ba1, negative outlook. These changeshave not had any impact on the cost of Casino’s bond debt or on its liquidity position. - **Entry of Tikehau Capital and Bpifrance in the capital of GreenYellow On 12 October 2018, the Group announced the signing of an agreement under which Tikehau Capital, an asset management and investment firm, and Bpifrance would acquire a stake in GreenYellow, Casino's subsidiary dedicated to solar energy and energy efficiency solutions. The operation was completed on 18 December 2018, through a €150 million share issue underwritten by the two new shareholders, giving them a combined 24% stake. The impact (net of transaction costs) on the Group’s consolidated financial statements was a €108 million increase in non-controlling interests and a €35 million increase in equity attributable to equity holders of the parent. ----- - **Partnership with the Quattrucci family On 15 October 2018, the Group announced the signing of a partnership with the Quattrucci family whereby twelve stores specialised in fresh products would join the Casino Group. These stores, located in the Île-de-France region and the Oise department, generated more than €300 million in sales in 2017. Since 1 January 2019, the stores have been supplied by the Casino Group; seven have been converted to the “Marché frais Géant” banner and the other five to the “Marché frais Leader Price” banner. - **Creation of a joint venture with ENGIE On 17 October 2018, GreenYellow and the ENGIE group announced the creation of a joint venture, Reservoir Sun, to help local authorities and companies in France to generate solar power to meet their electricity needs. The joint venture had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018. - **Interim dividend On 5 December 2018, the Company paid an interim dividend of €170 million (Note 12.9). ----- #### Note 3 Scope of consolidation",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2928,DELOITTE & ASSOCIES,2928.73,Accounting principles,2928.73.1,,"Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all material subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over which the parent company exercises control, joint control or significant influence, either directly or indirectly (see list of consolidated companies in Note 17). SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group (i) has power over the entity, (ii) is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries from the date when control is acquired to the date at which the Group no longer exercises control. All controlled companies are fully consolidated in the Group's statement of financial position, regardless of the percentage interest held. POTENTIAL VOTING RIGHTS Control is assessed by taking potential voting rights into account, but only if they are substantive; that is, if the entity has the practical ability to exercise its rights with respect to the exercise price, date and terms. The Group may own share warrants, share call options, debt or equity instruments that are convertible into ordinary shares or other similar instruments that have the potential, if exercised or converted, to give the Group voting power or reduce another party's voting power over the financial and operational policies of an entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group has control of another entity. Potential voting rights are not currently exercisable or convertible when, for example, they cannot be exercised or converted until a future date or until the occurrence of a future event. JOINT VENTURES A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that exercise joint control over an entity have rights to its net assets. Joint control involves the contractually agreed sharing of control over an entity, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. ASSOCIATES Associates are companies in which the Group exercises significant influence over financial and operational policies without having control. They are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING The equity method provides that an investment in an associate or a joint venture be recognised initially at acquisition cost and subsequently adjusted by the Group's share in profit or loss and, where appropriate, in other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. Goodwill related to these entities is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any impairment losses and gains or losses on disposal of investments in equity-accounted entities are recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses"". Profits/losses from internal acquisitions or disposals with equity-accounted associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's percentage interest in these companies. In the absence of any guidance in IFRS concerning cases where the amount to be eliminated is greater than the carrying amount of the investment in the equity-accounted company, the Group has elected to cap the amount eliminated from the accounts in the transaction year and to deduct the uneliminated portion from its share of the equity-accounted company's profits in subsequent years. The Group follows a transparent approach to accounting for associates under the equity method and takes into account, if relevant, its final percentage interest in the associate for the purpose of determining the proportion of profit (loss) to be eliminated. In the absence of any standard or interpretation covering dilution of the Group's interest in a subsidiary of an equity-accounted company, the dilution impact is recognised in the Group's share of the profit (loss) of the equity-accounted investee. ----- Business combinations As required by IFRS 3 revised, the consideration transferred (acquisition price) in a business combination is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred on the date of the transaction. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in ""Other operating expenses"", except for those related to the issue of equity instruments. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. At the date when control is acquired and for each business combination, the Group may elect to apply either the partial goodwill method (in which case, the amount of goodwill is limited to the portion acquired by the Group) or the full goodwill method. Under the full goodwill method, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value and goodwill is recognised on the full amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010 were accounted for using the partial goodwill method, which was the only method applicable prior to publication of the revised version of IFRS 3. In the case of an acquisition achieved in stages (step acquisition), the previously-held interest is remeasured at fair value as at the date control is acquired. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the previously-held interest is recognised directly in profit or loss (under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses""). The provisional amounts recognised on the acquisition date may be adjusted retrospectively if the information needed to revalue the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed corresponds to new information obtained by the buyer and concerns facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill may not be adjusted after the measurement period (not exceeding 12 months from the date when control is acquired). Any subsequent acquisitions of non-controlling interests do not give rise to the recognition of additional goodwill. Any contingent consideration is included in the consideration transferred at its acquisition-date fair value, whatever the probability that it will become due. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration due to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are recorded by adjusting goodwill if they occur during the measurement period or directly in profit or loss for the period under ""Other operating income"" or ""Other operating expenses"" if they arise after the measurement period, unless the obligation is settled in equity instruments. In that case, the contingent consideration is not remeasured subsequently. Intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies In the absence of any guidance in IFRS on the accounting treatment of intra-group transfers of shares in consolidated companies leading to a change in percentage interest, the Group applies the following principle: ‐ the transferred shares are maintained at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is eliminated in full from the accounts of the acquirer; ‐ non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share of equity, and a corresponding adjustment is made to consolidated reserves, without affecting profit or total equity. Costs and expenses related to intra-group transfers of shares and to internal restructuring in general are included in “Other operating expenses”. Foreign currency translation The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional currency of the Group's parent company. Each Group entity determines its own functional currency and all of their financial transactions are measured in that currency. The financial statements of subsidiaries that use a different functional currency from that of the parent company are translated using the closing rate method, as follows: - assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, are translated into euros at the closing rate, corresponding to the spot exchange rate at the reporting date; - income statement and cash flow items are translated into euros using the average rate of the period unless significant variances occur. The resulting translation differences are recognised directly within a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative differences recognised in equity on translation of the net investment in the operation concerned at successive reporting dates are reclassified to profit or loss. Because the Group applies the step-by-step method of consolidation, the cumulative translation differences are not reclassified to profit or loss if the foreign operation disposed is part of a sub-group. This reclassification will occur only at the disposal of the sub-group. Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and the resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement under ""Foreign currency exchange gains"" or ""Foreign currency exchange losses"". Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applicable on the transaction date. ----- Exchange differences arising on translation of the net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a separate component of equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. Exchange differences arising on translation of (i) foreign currency borrowings hedging a net investment denominated in a foreign currency or (ii) permanent advances made to subsidiaries are also recognised in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. In accordance with IAS 29, the statements of financial position and income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies are (i) restated to take account of changes in the general purchasing power of the local currency, using official price indices applicable on the reporting date, and (ii) converted into euros at the exchange rate on the reporting date. The Group has qualified Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy since 2018 (see Note 1.3.3).",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The price paid for 100% of the shares was €22 million (Note 4.5). Sarenza has been consolidated at net book value, leading to the recognition of provisional goodwill of €24 million (corresponding to the difference between the book value of the acquired net assets and the consideration transferred), which has been allocated to the Monoprix CGU. Sarenza’s contribution to consolidated net sales for the period from 30 April 2018 to 31 December 2018 was €97 million. If control of Sarenza had been acquired on 1 January 2018, it would have increased consolidated net sales by €70 million.

Franprix-Leader Price has retained a 49% interest in the group of stores and has a call option exercisable between 2021 and 2023 (Note 3.4.2). The same master franchisee acquired a 40% stake in another group of Franprix-Leader Price stores. The investment was accounted for as a transaction between owners. The master franchisee has a put option on its 40% stake and Franprix-Leader Price has a call option. A debt of €17 million was recognised on the date of the transaction (Note 3.4.1). This transaction had no material impact on consolidated equity. In addition, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of 126 stores during 2018, at a total cost of €79 million, including €68 million paid in cash during the period (Note 4.5). Provisional goodwill on these transactions amounted to €76 million. Some of the stores acquired were previously accounted for by the equity method in the Casino Group’s consolidated financial statements. The previously-held interest was therefore remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value, leading to the recognition of a €22 million gain in “Other operating income”. If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2018, the impact on the Group’s consolidated net sales, trading profit and net profit would not have been material. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Under the terms of the transaction, the Group received immediate proceeds amounting to €213 million (Note 4.6). Under IFRS 9, the block sale is only effective once the shares are actually sold on the market by the bank. Consequently the shares have not been derecognised at 31 December 2018 and a liability was recorded for €198 million corresponding to the value of the shares not yet sold on the market (Note 11.2.2). The income statement impact of the bank’s sale during 2018 of 1% of the capital was not material. At 31 December 2018, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s 39.2% equity in Mercialys, of which 14% corresponds to the shares not sold on the market at that date by the bank.

The amount disbursed for this acquisition was €19 million including transaction costs (Note 4.8). In addition, as part of the ongoing strategy to transform the store network and improve its profitability, Franprix-Leader Price had begun the process of selling a group of 105 Franprix and Leader Price stores to a master franchisee (Note 3.1.2). At 31 December 2017, the assets and liabilities of these stores – representing net assets of €33 million – had been reclassified as ""Assets held for sale"" for €67 million and ""Liabilities associated with assets held for sale"" for €34 million. Lastly, Franprix-Leader Price acquired control of various stores during 2017, at a total cost of €43 million (of which €23 million disbursed during 2017 and the balance in 2018).

The Group considers that it exercises significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the Mercialys Group. This position is based on (a) the absence of a majority vote on strategic decisions at meetings of the company's Board of Directors, which is mostly made up of independent directors, (b) the governance rules stipulating that Casino's representatives on the Mercialys Board may not take part in decisions concerning transactions carried out with the Group, (c) business contracts entered into between the Group and Mercialys on an arm's length basis, and (d) an analysis of the votes cast at recent General Shareholders’ Meetings of Mercialys (showing that Casino and its related parties do not control shareholder decisions at General Meetings). (ii) Tuya was set up in partnership with Éxito and Bancolombia to manage the banking services offered to customers of the stores in Colombia, primarily the possibility of signing up for credit cards in the stores. The partnership structure changed in October 2016 when Éxito became a 50% shareholder of Tuya. (iii) FIC was set up by GPA in partnership with Banco Itaú Unibanco SA (“Itaú Unibanco”) to finance purchases by GPA's customers. It is accounted for using the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over its operating and financial policies. (iv) The percentage interest corresponds to that held by Casino, except in the case of Tuya (interest held by the Éxito sub-group) and FIC (interest held by GPA). GPA holds 50% of the voting rights in FIC and 41.92% of the capital (including 6.16% through Via Varejo which is classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5). (v) The current assets of Banque du Groupe Casino, Tuya and FIC primarily concern their credit business. (vi) Concerning FIC, the adjustment concerns a statutory reserve over which Itaú Unibanco has exclusive rights. (vii) Stock dividends worth COP 20 billion (€6 million) paid to the joint venture partners.

It also includes the previously eliminated share of margin on transactions between Mercialys and the Group, recorded in trading profit for €5 million following the sale on the market of Mercialys shares representing 1% of the capital that were included in the TRS described in Note 2. The €9 million increase in 2017 corresponded mainly to the elimination of gains and losses on purchases and sales of property assets between Casino and Mercialys for the portion corresponding to Casino's percentage interest in Mercialys. (ii) The amount of €54 million in 2018 mainly related to (i) the same type of reclassification concerning the share of these losses from associates as in 2017 for an amount of €20 million; and (ii) and an amount of €20 million subscribed by Franprix-Leader Price to the capital increase of a master franchisee.

In 2018, the related management fees amounted to €6 million (2017: €6 million). ‐ Partnership agreement: this agreement was approved by Casino’s Board of Directors on 19 June 2012 and an addendum was signed on 12 November 2014. The partnership's fundamental principle, whereby Casino develops and manages a pipeline of projects that Mercialys acquires to feed its business growth, has been maintained in the new agreement. The original agreement concerned a pipeline of projects offering satisfactory visibility. The new agreement enables Mercialys to propose new projects that will be examined by Casino and tracked during monitoring committee meetings. Casino will not undertake any work until the order is reconfirmed by Mercialys once the necessary permits have been obtained and leases have been signed on units representing at least 60% of total projected rental revenues from signed leases. ----- The acquisition price of projects developed by Casino was calculated under the original agreement on the basis of (i) a rent capitalisation rate determined using a grid that is updated twice a year by reference to the rates used to value Mercialys' portfolio and (ii) projected rental revenues from the project. Under the new agreement, the projected internal rate of return (IRR) – within the range of 8% to 10% – may also be taken into account for pricing purposes. The principle whereby the upside and downside are shared equally between Casino and Mercialys has been maintained to take into account the actual conditions in which the assets will be marketed. For example, the price will be increased or reduced by 50% of any positive (upside) or negative (downside) difference between the actual rents negotiated during the marketing process and the rents projected at the outset. The contracts require the parties to meet during the pre-acquisition process. In exchange for the exclusive partnership, Mercialys has undertaken not to invest in any operations that could lead to a material increase in competition in the catchment area of any of the Casino Group's food stores. At the end of January 2017, the partnership agreement was extended by three years, until end-2020. No projects were sold under the partnership agreement in 2018. ‐ Support services agreement: the Group provides administrative, finance/accounting, IT and real estate support services to Mercialys. In 2018, the related fees amounted to €2 million (2017: €2 million). ‐ Consulting services agreement: Mercialys makes available to Casino the services of its team of real estate portfolio enhancement specialists. This agreement had no material impact in 2018 or 2017. The parties decided to terminate the agreement on 31 December 2018. A new fixed-term agreement has been signed with an initial term of six months (1 January to 30 June 2019), covering asset management services provided by Mercialys’ teams on projects managed on Casino’s behalf. The agreement is automatically renewable for successive six-month terms up to a maximum of 48 months in total. ‐ Exclusive sale mandate: Casino seeks buyers for real estate assets on behalf of Mercialys. ‐ Current account and cash management agreement: Casino has provided Mercialys with a €50 million confirmed line of credit expiring in December 2020 at an annual interest rate based on the Euribor plus a spread ranging from 40 bps to 95 bps depending on the amount borrowed under the facility. The Group also charges an annual 38-bps commitment fee (40% of the maximum 95-bps spread) on undrawn amounts. This agreement had no material impact in 2018 or 2017. In 2018, the Group signed a property development contract with Sacré Cœur, a subsidiary of Mercialys. After eliminating a percentage corresponding to the Group's interest in Mercialys, the contract led to the recognition of €24 million in ""Other revenue"" and a non-material contribution to EBITDA. In addition, the Group sold three property development projects of hypermarkets scheduled for transformation to third parties. After eliminating a percentage corresponding to the Group's 10% interest in the associates concerned, the transactions led to the recognition of €47 million in ""Other revenue"" and a €24 million contribution to EBITDA in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Group has decided to apply two different accounting methods for these NCI puts, depending on whether they were granted before or after 1 January 2010, as recommended by France's securities regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers): - NCI puts granted before the effective date of IAS 27 revised are accounted for using the goodwill method whereby the difference between the financial liability and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is recognised in goodwill.

The exercise price is the highest amount obtained using different calculation formulas. The formula applied at 31 December 2018 is based on a multiple of 12 times average net profit for the last two years. A 10% increase or decrease in net profit would lead to a €12 million increase or decrease in the financial liability as at 31 December 2018.

The exercise price of these options generally reflects the fair value of the underlying assets. Under the terms of the option contracts, the exercise price of written put and call options may be determined using earnings multiples of the companies concerned. In this case, the options are valued based on the latest published earnings for options exercisable at any time and earnings forecasts or projections for options exercisable as of a given future date. In many cases, the put option written by the Group is matched by a call written by the other party; in these cases, the value shown corresponds to that of the written put. Written put options on shares in non-controlled companies stood at €15 million as at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: €16 million), and concerned entities within the Monoprix and Franprix-Leader Price sub-groups.

A non-current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this condition to be met, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly probable. Management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset which, in accounting terms, should result in the conclusion of a sale within one year of the date of this classification. Considering these characteristics, net assets held for sale attributable to owners of the parent of the selling subsidiary are presented as a deduction from net debt (Note 11). Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and: - represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. An operation represents a separate major line of business when it constitutes a reportable segment. It is classed as discontinued if the criteria for classifying the related assets as ""held for sale"" have been met or when it has already been disposed of. Classification as a discontinued operation occurs when the operation is disposed of or on a prior date when it fulfils the criteria for classification as held for sale. When an operation is classified as discontinued, the comparative income statement and statement of cash flows are restated as if the operation had fulfilled the criteria for classification as discontinued as from the first day of the comparative period. Discontinued operations are presented on a separate line of the consolidated income statement, “Profit from discontinued operations”, which includes the net profit or loss of the discontinued operation up to the date of disposal, and if appropriate, any impairment loss recognised to write down the net assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell and/or any after-tax disposal gains or losses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

This category also includes cash flows from trade payables requalified as debt. In accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, segment information is disclosed on the same basis as the Group's internal reporting system used by the chief operating decision maker (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Since 2016, the Group's reportable segments are as follows: - France Retail: reportable segment comprising retail operating segments (mainly the Casino, Monoprix, Franprix-Leader Price and Vindémia sub-group banners); - Latam Retail: reportable segment comprising food retailing operating segments in Latin America (mainly the GPA food banners and the Éxito, Disco-Devoto and Libertad sub-group banners); - E-commerce: reportable segment comprising Cdiscount and the Cnova N.V. holding company. The operating segments included in France Retail and Latam Retail have similar businesses in terms of product type, assets and human resources required for operations, customer profile, distribution methods, marketing offer and long-term financial performance. These reportable segments reflect pure retail activities and retail-related activities. Given the dual strategy and the interconnection between retail and real estate, the operating segments include real estate asset management activities, property development activities and energy-related activities. Management assesses the performance of these segments on the basis of net sales, trading profit (which includes the allocation of holding company costs to all of the Group's business units) and EBITDA. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) is defined as trading profit plus recurring depreciation and amortisation expense. Segment assets and liabilities are not specifically reported internally for management purposes and are therefore not disclosed in the Group's IFRS 8 segment information. Segment information is determined on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements. ----- Gross margin Gross margin corresponds to the difference between ""Net sales"" and the ""Cost of goods sold"". “Cost of goods sold"" comprises the cost of purchases net of discounts, commercial cooperation fees and any tax credits associated with the purchases, changes in retail inventories, amortisation of the incremental costs of obtaining contacts and costs to fulfil contracts, and logistics costs. It also includes property development and property trading business costs and changes in the related inventories. Commercial cooperation fees are measured based on contracts signed with suppliers. They are billed in instalments over the year. At each year-end, an accrual is recorded for the amount receivable or payable, corresponding to the difference between the value of the services actually rendered to the supplier and the sum of the instalments billed during the year. Change in inventories Changes in inventories, which may be positive or negative, are determined after taking into account any impairment losses. Logistics costs Logistics costs correspond to the cost of logistics operations managed or outsourced by the Group, comprising all warehousing, handling and freight costs incurred after goods are first received at one of the Group's sites. Transport costs included in suppliers' invoices (e.g., for goods purchased on a ""delivery duty paid"" or ""DDP"" basis) are included in “Purchases and change in inventories”. Outsourced transport costs are recognised under ""Logistics costs"". Selling expenses “Selling expenses” consist of point-of-sale costs. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses correspond to overheads and the cost of corporate units, including the purchasing and procurement, sales and marketing, IT and finance functions. Pre-opening and post-closure costs Pre-opening costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation and post-closure costs are recognised in operating expense when incurred. The Group’s trade receivables are current financial assets (Note 11) that correspond to an unconditional right to receive consideration. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. The fair value of trade receivables usually corresponds to the amount on the invoice. A loss allowance for expected credit losses is recorded upon recognition of the receivable. The Group applies the simplified approach for the measurement of expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables, which are determined based on credit losses observed for receivables with the same profile, as adjusted to take into account forward-looking factors such as the customer’s credit status or the economic environment. Trade receivables can be sold to banks and continue to be carried as assets in the statement of financial position for as long as the contractual cash flows and substantially all the related risks and rewards are not transferred to a third party. At the inception of an agreement, the Group determines whether the agreement is or contains a lease agreement. The Group's lease agreements are recognised in accordance with IAS 17 which distinguishes between finance leases and operating leases. Finance lease agreements Lease agreements for property, plant and equipment that transfer nearly all the risks and benefits inherent to ownership are classified as finance leases. Leased assets are initially recorded at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. After initial recognition, the assets are depreciated over their expected useful life in the same way as other assets in the same category, or over the lease term if shorter, unless the Group has a reasonable certainty that it will obtain ownership at the end of the lease. Minimum finance lease payments are apportioned between the interest expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period covered by the lease agreement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Operating leases The other lease agreements are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the Group's statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Incentives received from the lessor are an integral part of the total net rental expense and are recorded as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term. Operating lease commitments (Note 7.2) correspond to fixed future minimum payments calculated over the non-cancellable term of operating leases.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

1211_2,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2928,DELOITTE & ASSOCIES,2928.136,Accounting principle Total revenue:,2928.136.1,,"Total revenue is analysed between “Net sales” and “Other revenue”. “Net sales"" include sales by the Group’s stores, service stations, e-commerce sites and restaurants, franchise fees, revenues from business leases and financial services revenues. Most of the amount reported under Group “Net sales” corresponds to revenue included in the scope of IFRS 15. “Other revenue"" consists of revenue from the property development and property trading businesses, rental revenues, miscellaneous service revenues, incidental revenues and revenues from secondary activities, and revenues from the energy business. The majority of amounts reported under “Other revenue” are included in the scope of IFRS 15, while rental revenues are included in the scope of IAS 17. Revenue is measured at the contract price, corresponding to the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of goods or services. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, which represent the units of account for revenue recognition purposes. Revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of the good or service passes to the customer. Revenue may therefore be recognised at a specific point in time or over time based on the stage of completion. The Group’s main sources of revenue are as follows: - Sales of goods (including through the property trading business): in this case, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, that of delivering the good to the customer. Revenue from these sales is recognised when control of the good is transferred to the customer upon delivery, i.e., generally: - at the checkout for in-store sales; - on receipt of the goods by the franchisee or affiliated store; - on receipt of the goods by the customer for e-commerce sales. - Sales of services, for example sales of subscriptions, franchising fees, logistics services, rental revenue and property management services: in this case, for operations included in the scope of IFRS 15, the Group generally has only one performance obligation, to supply the service, and the related revenues are recognised over the period in which the services are performed. - Property development revenues: in this case, the Group generally has several performance obligations, some of which may be satisfied at a given point in time and others over time based on the project’s percentage of completion. Profit from property development activities is generally calculated on a percentage-of-completion basis by reference to the projected margin on completion weighted by the percentage of completion determined by the inputs method. - Revenues from the energy business, for which the Group generally identifies a performance obligation when the solar power plant is delivered (in exchange for variable consideration in some cases) or when the energy performance contracts are sold. The Group also sells energy services for which the related revenue is recognised when the service is performed. The vast majority of revenues are recognised at a given point in time. If settlement of the consideration is deferred for an unusually long time and no promise of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment terms, revenue is recognised by adjusting the consideration for the effects of the time value of money. If significant, the difference between this price and the unadjusted transaction price is recognised in “Other financial income” over the payment deferral period, determined using the effective interest method. The Group operates loyalty programmes that enable customers to obtain discounts or award credits on their future purchases. Award credits granted to customers under loyalty programmes represent a performance obligation that is separately identifiable from the initial sales transaction. This performance obligation gives rise to the recognition of a contract liability. The corresponding revenue is deferred until the award credits are used by the customer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Based on this definition, a receivable does not constitute a contract asset. The Group recognises a contract asset when it has fulfilled all or part of its performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to payment (i.e., the Group does not yet have the right to invoice the customer). In light of its business, contract assets recognised by the Group are not material. - A contract liability corresponds to an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. The Group recognises contract liabilities mainly for award credits granted under its loyalty programmes, advances received and sales for which all or part of the performance obligation has not yet been fulfilled (e.g., sales of subscriptions and gift cards, and future performance obligations of the property development business for which the customer has already been invoiced followed by payment of consideration). - The incremental costs to obtain a contract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained and which it expects to recover. The costs to fulfil a contract are costs related directly to a contract that generate or enhance the resources that will be used by the Group in satisfying its performance obligations and which it expects to recover. For the Group, the costs of obtaining and fulfilling contracts correspond primarily to the costs incurred in connection with its franchising and affiliation business. These costs are capitalised and amortised over the life of the franchise or affiliation contract. The capitalised amounts are tested regularly for impairment. Contract assets and the costs of obtaining and fulfilling contracts are tested for impairment under IFRS 9.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions for impairment of inventories is recognised if the probable net realisable value is lower than cost. This analysis takes into account the business unit's operating environment and the type, age, turnover characteristics and sales pattern of the products concerned. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, except for inventories held by the GPA sub-group which uses the weighted average unit cost method, primarily for tax reasons. As GPA’s inventory turnover rate is very high, inventory values would not be materially different if the FIFO method was applied. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. Accordingly, logistics costs are included in the carrying amount together with supplier discounts deducted from ""Cost of goods sold"". The cost of inventories also includes gains or losses on cash flow hedges of future inventory purchases initially accumulated in equity.

Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred. - **Under defined benefit plans, the Group's obligation is measured using the projected unit credit method based on the agreements effective in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured separately to build up the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to measure the obligation vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the relevant country. The obligation is measured by independent actuaries annually for the most significant plans and for the employment termination benefit, and regularly for all other plans. Assumptions include expected rate of future salary increases, estimated average years of service, life expectancy and staff turnover rates (based on resignations only). Actuarial gains and losses arise from the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (differences between results based on previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred). All actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Past service cost, corresponding to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from the introduction of a new benefit plan or modification of an existing plan, is expensed immediately. The expense in the income statement comprises: - service cost, i.e., the cost of services provided during the year, recognised in trading profit; - past service cost and the effect of plan curtailments or settlements, generally recognised in ""Other operating income and expenses""; - interest cost, corresponding to the discounting adjustment to the projected benefit obligation net of the return on plan assets, recorded in ""Other financial income and expenses"". Interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate defined in IAS 19 to the net obligation (i.e., the projected obligation less related plan assets) recognised in respect of defined benefit plans, as determined at the beginning of the year. The provision recognised in the statement of financial position is measured as the net present value of the obligation less the fair value of plan assets.

During its meeting on 12 November 2018, the Board of Directors decided to pay an interim dividend for 2018 of €1.56 per share and this was duly paid on 5 December 2018. The interim dividend was paid on 108,756,207 shares, representing a total payout of €170 million recorded as a deduction from equity.

The lawsuit claimed that misleading information was issued at the time of the IPO concerning the macro-economic situation in Brazil and the irregularities uncovered at Cnova Brazil. On 19 March 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York announced its final approval of the proposed settlement of this class action for an amount of USD 28.5 million. The USD 28.5 million was paid in first-half 2018 (see Note 11.1) and most of the amount was covered by an insurance settlement received from Cnova's insurers. The balance, including estimated related costs, was covered by the provision recorded in 2016. Consequently, the settlement had no material impact on the Group’s net profit. On 14 December 2018, Cnova was informed by the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had completed the investigation into stock management issues and the audit of Cnova’s former subsidiary in Brazil launched in December 2015 and that it was not planning to take any action against Cnova. No penalties were levied on Cnova concerning this matter. - **Arbitration between GPA and Peninsula On 12 September 2017, GPA received a request for arbitration from Fundo de Investimento Inmobiliáro Peninsula (""Peninsula"") in order to discuss the calculation of rental charges and other operational matters related to leasing agreements concerning stores owned by Peninsula and operated by GPA. The lease contracts have a duration of 20 years as from 2005 and are automatically renewable for another 20-year period. Despite the discussions concerning application of the lease terms, the request for arbitration has no impact on the operation of the leased stores, which is contractually guaranteed. At this stage of the arbitration process, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the related risk. Based on the opinion of its legal advisors, the Company considers as possible the risk of an unfavourable ruling by the arbitration board. ----- - **Proceedings brought by the DGCCRF (French competition authority) against AMC and INCAA",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

Also, on 11 April 2017, the common purchasing entity INCA Achats, and its parent companies Intermarché and Casino, were prosecuted for economic imbalance and abusive commercial practices that allegedly took place in 2015 against 13 multinational companies in the hygiene and fragrance industry, with a fine of €2 million. The proceedings in both cases are still in progress. The Group considers that it complied with the applicable regulations during negotiations with the suppliers concerned by both sets of proceedings. Consequently, no provision has been set aside for these matters. Moreover, the Group is undergoing two inquiries by the French and European competition authorities. In early February 2017, representatives of France’s Competition Authority raided the premises of Vindémia Logistique and Vindémia Group and seized certain documents concerning their consumer goods supply and distribution activities on Reunion Island. At this stage, the Competition Authority has not issued any complaint. The Casino Group has contested the legitimacy of the raids before the Court of Cassation. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of the investigation. At the end of February 2017, representatives of the European Commission raided the premises of Achats Marchandises Casino – A.M.C. (formerly E.M.C. Distribution) and Intermarché-Casino Achats (INCA-A), in connection with an investigation into fast-moving consumer goods supply contracts, contracts for the sale of services to manufacturers of branded products and contracts for the sale of fast-moving consumer goods to consumers. INCA-A has ceased operations since the raids took place. At this stage, the European Commission has not issued any complaint. The Casino Group has contested the legitimacy of the raids before the General Court of the European Union. The Group is not currently able to predict the outcome of this matter. The preliminary investigations are still in progress and there were no significant developments in 2018. In June 2018, after giving notice in accordance with French law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015, the French Competition Authority launched an informal investigation into the creation of joint purchasing organisations in the food retailing sector. The investigation concerns in particular the Horizon central purchasing organisation set up between Auchan, Casino, Metro and Schiever. It is still in progress. - **GPA tax, social and civil contingent liabilities",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

GPA employs consulting firms to advise it in tax disputes, whose fees are contingent on the disputes being settled in GPA's favour. As at 31 December 2018, the estimated amount was €38 million (31 December 2017: €40 million). Casino has given a specific guarantee to its Brazilian subsidiary concerning notifications of tax adjustments received from the tax administration, for a total amount of BRL 1,317 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: BRL 1,223 million), including penalties and interest. Under the terms of the guarantee, Casino has undertaken to indemnify GPA for 50% of any damages incurred, provided those damages are definitive. Based on the commitment given by Casino to its subsidiary, the risk exposure amounts to BRL 658 million (€148 million) at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: BRL 611 million, representing €154 million). As the risks of liability are only considered possible, Casino has not recognised a provision in its financial statements for this amount. ----- - **GPA contingent assets Exclusion of ICMS from the PIS/COFINS tax base: Since the introduction of non-cumulative PIS and COFINS tax credits, GPA has asserted the right to deduct ICMS tax from the base used to calculate PIS and COFINS taxes. GPA’s position was supported by a Brazilian federal supreme court (STF) ruling on 15 March 2017 that the ICMS tax should be excluded from the PIS and COFINS tax base. Based on the STF’s ruling and the opinion of its internal and external advisors, GPA considered that the probability of having to settle the amounts deducted in prior periods was low. It therefore released in first-half 2017 the corresponding provisions set up in prior periods for an amount of BRL 117 million (€32 million). Since the supreme court’s ruling on 15 March 2017, the procedure has continued in line with the expectations of GPA and its advisors, without GPA’s judgement being called into question concerning the release of the provisions, although the court has not yet handed down its final decision. GPA and its external legal advisors believe that this decision concerning the application method will not limit its rights under the legal proceedings brought since 2003 which are still in progress. However, an asset cannot be recognised for the tax credits until all the stages in the procedure have been completed. Based on the information available as of 31 December 2018, GPA estimates that these tax credits represent a potential asset of BRL 1,400 million (€315 million) for its Retail business. In the case of Via Varejo, which is classified as a discontinued operation, the estimated potential tax asset amounts to around BRL 1,106 million (roughly €249 million), including an additional amount of BRL 453 million (€102 million) that will be owed exclusively to GPA. #### Note 14 Related-party transactions Related parties are: - parent companies (mainly Rallye, Foncière Euris, Finatis and Euris); - entities that exercise joint control or significant influence over the Company; - subsidiaries (Note 17); - associates (primarily Mercialys) (Note 3.3); - joint ventures (Note 3.3); - members of the Board of Directors and Management Committee (Note 8.4). The Company has relations with all of its subsidiaries in its day-to-day management of the Group. The Company and its subsidiaries receive strategic advice from Euris, the ultimate holding company, under strategic advice and assistance agreements. The Company also receives other recurring services from Euris and Foncière Euris (provision of staff and premises). The expenses recorded during the year in respect of these agreements with Casino and its subsidiaries totalled €3.7 million, of which €3.1 million for strategic advisory services and €0.6 million for the provision of staff and premises. In connection with the deployment of its dual model combining retail and commercial real estate activities, Casino and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of property development operations with Mercialys (Note 3.3.6). Related-party transactions with individuals (directors, corporate officers and members of their families) are not material. ----- #### Note 15 Subsequent events - **Signing of purchase pledges for the sale of six Géant hypermarkets On 19 January 2019, Casino Group announced that it had signed agreements to sell six hypermarkets in France to members of the E. Leclerc Group for a combined consideration of €101 million. The hypermarket disposals do not form part of the non-strategic asset disposal plan announced on 11 June 2018 (Note 2); they result from the Group’s stated intention to dispose of a certain number of structurally loss-making stores. The disposals are expected to close in the first half of 2019. - **Sale of hypermarket and supermarket properties On 21 January 2019, the Group announced that it had signed an agreement with investment fund Fortress Investment Group for the sale of 26 store properties (13 Géant Casino hypermarkets, 3 Casino hypermarkets and 10 Casino supermarkets) based on a total valuation of €501 million. The transaction was completed on 8 March 2019 and the Group received payment of 80% of the value of the assets, i.e., €392 million, net of transfer costs. The Group will now be associated with the value creation of the operation, via an interest held in the new entity created by the buyer to enhance the value of the portfolio and sell the portfolio on the market under the best possible conditions. As such, depending on the entity’s performance, the Casino Group could receive up to an additional €150 million in the next few years. The Group will continue to operate the stores under leases representing annual rent of €32 million. - **Agreement for the sale of R2C On 14 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of an agreement with Compass Group providing for the sale of Casino’s contract catering services, R2C. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2019, subject to consultation with the employee representative bodies and the approval of the French Competition Authority. - **Signing of purchase pledges for the sale of loss-making stores On 15 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of agreements to sell a selection of structurally loss-making stores, both integrated stores and master franchisees’ stores, for a total of €42 million. In the case of the integrated stores, these commitments represent a value of €25 million in sale proceeds and relate to the following: - 17 stores (8 Leader Price, 8 Casino supermarkets and 1 Hyper Casino) to be sold to Lidl, and - the sale of the Géant hypermarket in Roubaix (59) to a Leclerc member with a simultaneous sale of its real estate to the owner of the shopping mall. These 18 stores represented net sales of €88 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €12 million. At the same time, master franchisees of the Group, with which the Casino group has a 49% stake, have signed an agreement to sell 16 stores (9 Leader Price and 7 Casino supermarkets) to Lidl for a total of €17 million. These 16 stores represented net sales of €60 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €9 million. The disposals are expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, subject to prior consultation with the employee representative bodies and the fulfilment of the usual conditions precedent. - **Block sale of Via Varejo shares under a total return swap (TRS) contract Pursuant to the authorisation given by its Board of Directors on 20 February 2019, GPA has sold to a leading financial institution under a total return swap contract 40 million Via Varejo shares, representing 3.09% of the capital, for BRL 200 million (€45 million). The transaction will have the effect of reducing GPA’s interest in Via Varejo to 36.27%. - **Signature of purchase pledges to sell two Géant hypermarkets On 28 February 2019, Casino announced the signature of unilateral purchase agreements with a view to the sale of two Géant hypermarkets located in the towns of Nevers and Montauban to Groupement Les Mousquetaires for a total value of €23.4 million covering the real estate and business assets. These stores represented net sales of €36 million in 2018 for a trading loss of €3.5 million. The disposals are expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, subject to prior consultation with the employee representative bodies with whom a meeting was held on 27 February, and the fulfilment of the usual conditions precedent. ----- #### Note 16 Statutory Auditors' fees",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

(ii) The percentage interests correspond to the percentages held by the GPA sub-group. As regards Via Varejo, GPA held 39.37% of the voting rights and 43.23% of the shares, including 3.86% through a total return swap (TRS) at 31 December 2018 (Note 2). On 20 February 2019, the holding increased to 36.27% following the signature of a second total return swap (Note 15). (iii) FIC and BINV finance purchases made by GPA's customers. These entities were created through a partnership between Banco Itaú Unibanco S.A (""Itaú Unibanco""), GPA, and Via Varejo. They are accounted for by the equity method as GPA exercises significant influence over their operating and financial policies.

On 27 April 2015, Éxito signed a contractual agreement, initially with a two-year term, granting it more than 75% of the Disco voting rights and exclusive control over the sub-group's strategic decisions. On 29 December 2016, the agreement was extended until 30 June 2019. It will then be rolled over automatically until 30 June 2021. (vi) Via Varejo’s main subsidiaries and joint ventures are Cnova Comercio Electronico, BINV and Bartira. The entire sub-group has been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. (vii) The trust's governance is specified in the agreement between the parties. Éxito is the majority partner and FIC has rights with respect to certain Viva Malls business decisions concerning such matters as acquisitions and disposals in excess of a certain amount or the method of setting budgets and business plan targets. The agreement also states that Éxito is the sole provider of property management, administrative and marketing services for Viva Malls and that it is paid an arm's length fee for these services.

Operating lease expense is replaced by depreciation of the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the financial liability. Up to now, the Group has classified most of its leases as operating leases and recognised rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. No asset or liability is recognised except to reflect any timing difference between the rental payment period and the period in which the related expense is recognised. Consequently, adoption of IFRS 16 will have a positive impact on performance indicators such as EBITDA and, to a lesser extent, trading profit, and a negative impact on finance costs. Consolidated net profit may also be reduced because total rental expense is generally higher at the beginning of the lease and decreases over time, unlike the straight-line charge recognised under the current standard. Additionally, net cash from operating activities will be higher as cash outflows corresponding to repayment of the principal amount of the financial liability and to interest payments will be classified as cash flows from financing activities. The Group mostly has property leases; annual rent on the roughly 6,400 property leases amounted to €840 million in 2018, out of total rental expense for the year of €987 million. The adoption of IFRS 16 will affect primarily the accounting for the operating leases on the Group’s stores and warehouses, operated for the most part by the Retail business. In 2018, the Group continued to identify and analyse the data required for the application of IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019. During the year, the Group started to deploy an IT application to manage leases from an operational and financial standpoint on a fully integrated basis. The deployment process will be completed during the first half of 2019. The Group has decided to apply the full retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019, by restating the comparative information for 2018. The Group has chosen to apply the recognition exemptions in IFRS 16 concerning: - short-term leases, and - leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Lease payments not included in the initial measurement of the financial liability (for example, variable lease payments) will be recorded in operating expense, together with payments for short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease term will correspond to the non-cancellable period, together with the period covered by any option to extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and the period covered by any option to terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The Group will apply the position of the French accounting standards authority (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) concerning the lease term to be applied to commercial leases in France. The discount rate used to calculate the value of the right-of-use asset and the financial liability will be determined on a country-by-country basis. At this stage, the estimated effect of applying IFRS 16 has been determined based on property leases, which account for substantially all of the impact. It does not include the effect on equipment leases, which is in the process of being estimated. The estimated effect on the opening statement of financial position at 1 January 2018 would be as follows (excluding equipment leases): - An increase in assets (mainly arising from the recognition of right-of-use assets) of between €3.7 billion and €4.2 billion. - An increase in liabilities (arising from the recognition of a financial liability) of between €4.0 billion and €4.5 billion. - A reduction in equity, before tax, of between €0.2 billion and €0.4 billion. This impact can be broken down by segment as follows: -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

The Group has chosen to present right-of-use assets and the related financial liabilities on separate lines of the consolidated statement of financial position. “Net debt” as defined by the Group (see Note 11) will not be impacted by the application of IFRS 16. The actual effect of applying IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 may be different from the above estimates for the following reasons: - the Group has not yet completed its tests and assessments of controls over the new lease accounting system, and - the Group may change the chosen methods of applying new accounting standards in the period up to the date when its first financial statements presented in accordance with IFRS 16 are published (i.e., the 2019 interim financial statements). As at 31 December 2018, off-balance sheet non-cancellable operating lease commitments (property leases and equipment leases) amounted to €3,252 million based on IAS 17 (Note 7.2). The difference between this off-balance sheet commitment and the estimated financial liability for property leases under IFRS 16 can be explained primarily as follows: - The financial liability is greater because the estimate is based on the period during with the Group is reasonably certain of using the asset, which is longer than the non-cancellable period. - The effect of this is offset by the effect of discounting the future lease payments, unlike under IAS 17. In the absence of any generally accepted position concerning the application of impairment tests, the Group has not performed new impairment tests taking into account the effects of applying IFRS 16. The accounting treatment of leases by the lessor is similar to that under IAS 17; leases continue to be classified as finance leases or operating leases as applicable. Based on the above, the Group does not expect the application of IFRS 16 to have a material impact on the financial statements, with regards to leases where the Group is lessor. However, certain additional disclosures will be made as from 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,821

They require an entity to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. These amendments, which will be applicable on a prospective basis, clarify the definition of a business and the application guidance for the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a group of assets rather than a business. Under the amended definition, to be considered a business, the integrated set of activities and assets must create output in the form of goods and services delivered to customers, rather than being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors or other owners, members or participants. In addition, an optional concentration test has been introduced to simplify the assessment of whether an integrated set of activities and assets is a group of assets and not a business. These amendments, which will be applicable on a prospective basis, amend and expand the definition of materiality in IAS 1 and IAS 8. They also align the definition of materiality with the wording of the _IFRS Conceptual Framework._ These interpretations and amendments are not expected to have any material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. ----- # CASINO, GUICHARD-PERRACHON _Société Anonyme_ 1 cours Antoine Guichard 42000 SAINT-ETIENNE ####  Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2018 ----- Tour First TSA 14444 92037 PARIS-LA DEFENSE Cedex S.A.S. à capital variable 438 476 913 R.C.S.

As part of the valuation of these assets, the Group allocates goodwill and brands to cash- generating units (CGUs) using the method described in Notes 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. The Group performs impairment tests at least once a year and whenever a trigger for impairment is identified. We considered the valuation of goodwill and brands, including the goodwill relating to Franprix - Leader Price and the brand relating to Extra, to be a key audit matter due to the following: - their materiality in the consolidated financial statements; - the importance of management’s estimates, assessments and significant assumptions on the basis of which their recoverable amount is determined, based on the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from these assets; - the sensitivity of the valuation of these recoverable amounts to certain assumptions.|We examined the compliance of the methodology implemented by management with the accounting standards in force. We also assessed the main estimates used and analyzed in particular: - the consistency of cash flow projections with the budget and the medium-term business plan prepared by management, as well as the consistency of these projections with the Group’s historical performance and the economic context in which the Group operates; - the methods and parameters used to determine the discount rates applied to estimated cash flows. With the assistance of our valuation experts, we recalculated these discount rates using the most recent market data available, compared the results obtained with (i) the rates adopted by management and (ii) the rates observed for several players operating in the same business sector as the Group, and assessed the reasonableness of the rates adopted by management; - the relevance of the sensitivity scenarios used by management.

These benefits, generally paid on the basis of a percentage defined contractually, and applied on purchases made from suppliers, are recorded as a deduction from cost of goods sold. Considering the material impact of these accounting entries on net profit for the year, the large number of contracts involved and the necessity for management to estimate the related purchases for each supplier, we considered the valuation of rebates to be received from suppliers at year-end to be a key audit matter.|Within the scope of our audit, we :  examined the internal control measures relating to the process for monitoring these rebates in the Group’s various significant subsidiaries and carried out tests on the key controls;  reconciled, on a sampling basis, the contractual terms relating to rebates to be received from suppliers with their valuation;  examined the estimates used by management to determine these year- end rebates, in particular the valuation of the level of purchases at year-end used to determine the amounts of the invoices to be issued;  - followed up on the collection of these receivables subsequent to the year-end date.| |Recognition of tax credits and follow up on the contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |Please see Notes “5.1 – Key indicators by reportable segment”, “6.8 – Other current assets”, “6.9.1 – Breakdown of other non-current assets” and “13.3 – Contingent assets and liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Within the scope of its retail activities at GPA, the Group recognizes ICMS tax credits. The balance amounts to €519 million as of December 31, 2018. These tax credits are accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold in the income statement.|We interviewed the various persons who hold responsibilities in the GPA organization to identify and to obtain an understanding of the tax credits, existing disputes and liabilities and the related judgements.| ----- |Recognition of tax credits and follow up on the contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |These tax credits are recognized based on: (i) the interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence, in particular in the retail sector in Brazil, (ii) legal opinions provided by the subsidiary’s external tax advisors, when it is considered that they can be estimated and that their recoverability is probable. Furthermore, as described in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group estimated to €315 million the amount of contingent PIS and COFINS tax credit assets in relation to the exclusion of ICMS from the calculation basis of these two taxes. GPA is also involved in various administrative and legal proceedings in Brazil arising, notably, from tax claims filed by the Brazilian tax authorities. These tax risks that are estimated at €2,128 million as of December 31, 2018 were analysed as contingent liabilities and no provisions weere recognized as of December 31, 2018, as indicated in Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements.|Concerning tax credits, we examined: - the internal control environment and process in which these tax credits are monitored and we tested the related key controls using sampling techniques; - the documentation that evidences either the recognition of ICMS tax credits over the year, or the qualification of the PIS and COFINS tax credits as a contingent tax asset; - the legal or technical opinions provided by law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the recognition of the tax credits shown in the consolidated financial statements; - the assumptions used by management to draw up the recovery plan underlying the recognized ICMS tax credits. Concerning contingent liabilities, we: - reconciled the list of identified disputes with the information provided by GPA’s main law firms that we contacted; - examined the information on the legal or technical proceedings and/or opinions provided by the law firms or external experts chosen by management to assess the qualification of the various disputes as contingent liabilities; - examined the risk estimates prepared by the Group and reconciled them with the figures in relation to the contingent tax liabilities that are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| ||| ----- |Recognition of tax credits and follow up on contingent tax liabilities at GPA|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |We considered the recognition and recoverability of both the tax credits and the valuation and monitoring of contingent tax liabilities to be key audit matters for the following reasons: (i) the significance in the accounts of the tax credit balance, the contingent asset relating to PIS and COFINS tax credits and the amount of contingent tax liabilities as of December 31, 2018, (ii) the complexity of the Brazilian tax legislation related to taxes and (iii) the use of judgements and estimates by management in connection with the recognition of tax credits and the valuation of the contingent tax liabilities.|Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.| |Presentation and valuation of the Via Varejo discontinued operations|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |Please see Notes “2 – Significant events of the year” and “3.5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements|| |Via Varejo constitutes the entire “Latam Electronics” operating sector and the e- commerce business in Brazil through its subsidiary Cnova Brazil (hereinafter “Via Varejo”). As of December 31, 2018, the Via Varejo assets and liabilities held for sale are shown on a separate line and total respectively €5,698 million and €4,426 million, hence net assets amounting to €1,272 million (about 11% of the consolidated net assets). As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the disposal of the Group’s investment in Via Varejo initiated in 2016 could not be finalized as of December 31, 2018. However, while seeking to continue with such disposal to strategic investors, the subsidiary’s Board of Directors authorized alternatives to conclude this disposal by December 31, 2019.|Within the scope of our audit: - we analyzed the documentation underlying the ongoing disposal of Via Varejo which led the Group’s management to maintain Via Varejo in assets held for sale and discontinued operations, particularly (i) the minutes of the GPA Board of Directors’ meeting which authorized the alternatives to conclude the sale by December 31, 2019, including the possibility of selling its investment via stock market transactions and (ii) the terms of sale of a portion of the ordinary shares of Via Varejo in December 2018, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements;| ----- |Presentation and valuation of the Via Varejo discontinued operations|Col2| |---|---| |Risk identified|Our response| |Please see Notes “2 – Significant events of the year” and “3.5 – Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations” to the consolidated financial statements|| |As the Group therefore estimated the disposal of Via Varejo to be highly probable in 2019, Via Varejo’s activities were maintained in discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5: - the assets and liabilities as well as the cash flow of Via Varejo were presented on a separate lines respectively of the consolidated statement of financial position and of the consolidated statement of cash flows; - the after tax net profit of the Via Varejo activities was presented in a separate line of the consolidated statement of income (“Net profit from discontinued operations”); - Via Varejo was valued at the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less selling costs. Given the significance of Via Varejo’s contribution to the consolidated financial statements and the degree of judgement in relation to (i) the highly probable nature of the disposal that justifies to maintain the recording of the Via Varejo’s business in the discontinued operations and (ii) the valuation of the investment, we believe the presentation and valuation of the discontinued operations of Via Varejo to be a key audit matter|- we examined the presentation of all of the items comprising the assets and liabilities, the cash flow statement and the after tax net profit of the Via Varejo activities in “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities associated with assets held for sale” (Note 3.5.1), as well as in profit and cash flow from discontinued operations (Notes 3.5.2 and 3.5.3), with regard to IFRS 5. - we assessed the methods for determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities, less estimated selling costs, as of December 31, 2018. In particular, we considered whether the estimate of the fair value of Via Varejo was consistent with the disposal arrangements planned by management.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgement throughout the audit and furthermore: - identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; - evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; - assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; - evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,821
