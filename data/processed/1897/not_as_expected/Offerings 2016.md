**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED NOVEMBER 1, 2016**

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


**AUTODIS S.A.**
**€510,000,000 Senior Secured Notes**
**(in a combination of fixed and floating rate notes)**
**€** **% Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2022**
**€** **Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022**
Autodis S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) € million in
aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and € million in
aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed
Rate Notes, the “Notes”).
The Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate of % and will mature on, 2022. The Issuer will pay interest on the Fixed
Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on, 2017. Prior to, 2018, the Issuer will be
entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium. At any time on or
after, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the
Fixed Rate Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Fixed Rate Notes issued) with the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings. Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Fixed Rate Notes issued) in each calendar year at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof.
The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR plus % per annum, reset quarterly. The Issuer
will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on each of,, and, commencing on,
2017. Prior to, 2017, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes by paying a
“make-whole” premium. At any time on or after, 2017, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at the
redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to
make an offer to purchase the Notes. A change of control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net
senior secured leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future
debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and future
hedging obligations (if any). The Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by Autodis Group S.A.S., a société
_par actions simplifiée organized and existing under the laws of France, the direct parent company of the Issuer (the “Parent Guarantor”),_
and Autodistribution S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France, a direct subsidiary of the Issuer (the
“Subsidiary Guarantor” and together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the
respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee and rank pari passu in right of
payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of Dakar Acquisition S.A., the indirect parent company of the
Issuer (“LuxCo 6”); (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, material bank accounts and material intragroup receivables of the Parent
Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings); (iv) a first-priority
security interests over certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM
S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital
stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A., (B)
Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.’s material intragroup receivables (the “Collateral”). The
Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by first-priority security
interests over, among other things, the Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Notes. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, holders
of Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The validity, enforceability
and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Guarantees and the security interests and the
liability of the Guarantors, are subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity
_and enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests.” The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s_
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries,
including the Super Senior Obligations, that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by, and is secured by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that
do not guarantee or provide security in favor of the Notes.
The Notes will be represented on issuance by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be delivered in bookentry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on or about,
2016 (the “Issue Date”). Interests in each Global Note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited
circumstances. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”
Application will be made to The Channel Islands Securities Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) for the listing of and permission
to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.
**INVESTING IN THE NOTES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. SEE “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 30 FOR A DISCUSSION**
**OF CERTAIN RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN THE NOTES.**

**Issue price of the Fixed Rate Notes:** **%, plus accrued interest from the Issue Date**
**Issue price of the Floating Rate Notes:** **%, plus accrued interest from the Issue Date**


**The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the**
**securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in**

varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in

# Forward-looking statements

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements that are based on our current
expectations and projections about future events. All statements other than statements of
historical fact included in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, statements
regarding our future financial position, risks and uncertainties related to our business, strategy,
capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and objectives for future operations, may be
deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar expressions
or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the
future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forwardlooking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent
written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf
as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, you
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

vi


-----

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. Factors that
could cause such differences in actual results include:

  - the impact of material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network and
increases in transportation costs;

  - the ability of third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements;

  - the impact of French, Polish, Benelux and worldwide economic and other conditions on
demand for our products;

   - the risk that our customers’ financial difficulties require us to write off debts;

  - the impact of competition in the spare parts distribution industry;

  - our reliance on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks and the length of
service intervals;

  - disruption of our information technology ("IT") systems;

  - the increasing use of technology in our industry;

  - failure to maintain or improve our brand image;

  - the risk that our growth strategy may not be successful;

  - our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our network;

  - the impact of price and margin pressures;

  - the termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors;

  - our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

  - the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including in relation to labor, employment
and tax;

  - the deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions;

  - the impact of higher employment costs;

  - the impact of environmental, health and safety regulations;

  - the risk associated with fluctuations in our working capital requirements;

  - the risk of material losses as a result of product liability and warranty claims, including
claims for products we import from outside the European Union;

  - the impact of legal and arbitration proceedings;

  - our failure to comply with tax regulations and actions by tax authorities;

  - the impact of competition and antitrust laws; and

  - other risks associated with our financing, the Notes and our structure discussed under “Risk
_Factors.”_

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations in “Summary,” “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of
_financial condition and results of operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum_
describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk
factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

# Industry and market data

This Offering Memorandum contains market and competitive position data from industry
publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources believed to be reliable
by management. These third-party sources include: L.E.K. M&A (basing itself on a number of
other sources, including public sources), CCFA (Comite´ des Constructeurs Franc¸ais d’Automobiles),
CNPA (Conseil National des Professions de l’Automobile), FEDA (Fe´de´ration des Syndicats de la
_Distribution Automobile), GiPA (aftermarket studies), INSEE (Institut National de la Statistique et_
_des Etudes Economiques), Ministe`re de l’Ecologie, du De´velopement Durable, des Transports et_
_du Logement and Apres-vente-auto.com._

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. We cannot,
however, assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information, and we have not
independently verified such industry and market data. Industry and consultant publications and
forecasts generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not
guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have used is reliable,
neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or
derived from these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their
accuracy or completeness. Market data and statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily
reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is
based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents,
including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the
relevant market.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented
herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various
factors, including those discussed under “Risk factors.” As far as we are aware and have been
able to ascertain from information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted
that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and
our position in the industry based on our experience and our own investigation of market
conditions. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you that any of these statements are
accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or
information has been verified by any independent sources.

# Presentation of financial information and other data

### Financial statements presented

We have included in this Offering Memorandum an English translation of, and primarily discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2016, with corresponding unaudited income statement and cash flow data for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015.

Unless specified otherwise, the consolidated financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum relates to the Parent Guarantor. We do not present in this Offering Memorandum
any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer. The Parent Guarantor guarantees
the Notes on a senior secured basis. Accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the
“Group” in respect of financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Parent
Guarantor and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Both the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer
are holding, management and finance companies with no revenue-generating activities of their
own. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Each of the Issuer and
_the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue-generating operations of its own_
_and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the_
_Notes, as applicable.”_

The audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor, an English translation of
which is included herein, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016, with corresponding unaudited income statement and cash flow
data for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, included herein have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the IFRS standard applicable to interim
financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial
statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Critical accounting_
_policies.”_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should
consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and
generally accepted auditing principles in the United States and how those differences could
affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and
2015, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, are uncertified English translations and
were originally issued in French.

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended August
31, 2016, included in this Offering Memorandum, has been derived by adding the consolidated
financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015,
to the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the eight months ended
August 31, 2016, and subtracting the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor
for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. The financial information for the twelve months
ended August 31, 2016, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any
future date. This information has not been audited or reviewed by any auditors.

### The Doyen Auto Acquisition

We acquired Doyen Auto on September 30, 2016, with the proceeds from the Bridge Facility (as
defined herein), which we intend to repay in full with the proceeds from this Offering. The
financial data of Doyen Auto have historically been prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP
(as defined herein) and are not directly comparable with the financial information of the Parent
Guarantor prepared in accordance with IFRS. We will account for the Doyen Auto Acquisition (as
defined herein) using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that we recognize
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingencies assumed at their fair value as of
the completion of the applicable acquisition. Doyen Auto’s financial results will be consolidated
with ours going forward. As a result, our financial results in the future will not be directly
comparable to those in this Offering Memorandum. See “Management’s discussion and analysis
_of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations—_
_Factors specific to our business—Acquisitions and disposals.”_

We have not included any financial statements for Doyen Auto in this Offering Memorandum.
We have, however, presented certain summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data,
which have been prepared to give effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition as if it had occurred on
September 1, 2015. These pro forma data have been derived through the mathematical addition
of certain unaudited income statement data for the Parent Guarantor for the twelve months
ended August 31, 2016, and certain income statement data derived from the unaudited
management accounts for Doyen Auto for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, prepared
in accordance with Belgian GAAP, and by then applying adjustments to give effect to estimated
future purchasing and cost savings. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available
information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. These unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent
what our results of operations or other financial information would have been if the Doyen Auto
Acquisition had occurred on September 1, 2015, or on any other date, and such data do not
purport to project the results of operations for any future period. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial data have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus Directive.

### Other financial measures

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA,
EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(including Doyen Auto), operating cash flow, cash conversion, change in working capital and
change in working capital margin (collectively, the “Non-IFRS measures”) (each as defined by us)
that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, SEC requirements, IFRS or the
accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We have included these measures because
management uses them to measure operating performance in presentations to our directors and
as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as for monitoring certain aspects of our
cash flows from operating activities and liquidity. Our Non-IFRS measures are defined by us as
follows:

  - “EBITDA” represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax,
financial items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from
operations and depreciation/amortization expense (as included in our financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015 and 2016). For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income/(loss) from
continuing operations, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial
_and other information”;_

  - “EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as EBITDA divided by revenue;

  - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain
items we believe are non-recurring, or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing
performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a
relevant measure for assessing performance and cash flows and thus aids in understanding
our profitability for a given period. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see
footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

x


-----

  - “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue;

  - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto)” represents Adjusted EBITDA after
giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition and to anticipated purchasing and
cost savings from the Doyen Auto Acquisition. These pro forma data have been derived
through the mathematical addition to our results of (i) the Adjusted EBITDA of Doyen
Auto for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, which represents the EBITDA of Doyen
Auto derived from the unaudited consolidated management accounts of Doyen Auto as of
and for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, adjusted for certain shareholder
allowances, certain consulting fees, a one-off donation to the International Society of
Explosive Engineers foundation and certain headcount reduction costs adjustment and (ii)
certain adjustments to give effect to future purchasing and cost savings following the
Doyen Auto Acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize all these
purchasing and cost savings, and the costs we incur to realize these savings may be higher
than expected or may outweigh the benefits. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_business—We may face challenges in integrating acquired businesses and in integrating_
_any future potential acquisition, and may be unable to realize the expected savings from_
_these businesses and any other cost improvement measures we have taken.” For a_
reconciliation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto) to net income/(loss)
from continuing operations, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated
_financial and other information”;_

  - “Operating cash flow” represents Adjusted EBITDA excluding capital expenditure. For a
reconciliation of operating cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 8 under
“Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information—Other financial and
_pro forma data”;_

  - “cash conversion,” expressed as a percentage, represents Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditure, net of disposals, divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

  - “cash conversion (excluding exceptional capital expenditure),” expressed as a percentage,
represents Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure, net of disposals, other than those
incurred in connection with our new logistics platform in Réau, France, divided by
Adjusted EBITDA;

  - “change in working capital” represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade
receivables and other current assets and liabilities; and

  - “change in working capital margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as change in
working capital divided by revenue.

We present Non-IFRS measures for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance that
items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that
similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations of the Non-IFRS measures are
based on various assumptions and management estimates. These amounts have not been and, in
certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm.

We present the Non-IFRS measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures
of our operating performance and ability to service our debt and because our management uses
these measures to assess our liquidity and operating performance. These measures should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any
other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

Our Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Our Non-IFRS measures may not give
an accurate or complete picture of our results or transactions for the periods presented, may not
be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision. The limitations with respect to our Non-IFRS measures include:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

xi


-----

  - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

  - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required
to pay;

  - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
statements of cash flows;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we
consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

  - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to
be replaced in the future, and the Non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements
for such replacements.

Other companies in our industry may calculate the Non-IFRS measures differently than we do,
which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our NonIFRS measures and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations or reduce our indebtedness. You should rely primarily on
our IFRS results and use these Non-IFRS measures only as a supplement to evaluate our
performance.

### Restatements

Since January 1, 2015, we have applied the interpretation IFRIC 21 which clarifies that the
obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant
legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. Since these amendments were applied
retroactively, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2014, reflect the effects of this application of IFRIC 21.

### Rounding

Certain numerical figures contained in this Offering Memorandum, including financial
information, market data and certain operating data, have been subject to rounding
adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column or a row in
tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row or the sum of
certain numbers presented as a percentage may not conform exactly to the total percentage
given.

Our financial statements are presented in euro rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may
occur due to such rounding.

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also
hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle IAM and, since the acquisition of Doyen
Auto on September 30, 2016, in the Benelux light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we generated
revenue of €1,425.8 million, of which 86.6% was generated in France and a Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (including Doyen Auto) of €115.2 million. We believe that as of August 31, 2016, and
giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we held a market share in excess of 22%
in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. Following the Doyen Auto
Acquisition, we believe that we hold a market share of approximately 21.0% in terms of revenue
in the Benelux light vehicle IAM. Our addressable market has demonstrated resilience in recent
years and currently benefits from advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with
significant purchasing power with aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network
throughout France, which we have expanded with the ACR Acquisition in April 2014 and more
recently, the Doyen Auto Acquisition on September 30, 2016, allows us to deliver a broad range
of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 281 suppliers. We have also
distributed light vehicle parts across the Benelux IAM since the completion of the Doyen Auto
Acquisition.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France and Benelux is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy
aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors and online retailers. These
distributors sell these parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fastfitters, fleet garages for light vehicles and trucks, and car centers (“garages”), some of which are
affiliated with us and operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”).

Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to garages represented 75.7% of our revenue in France
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, and sales by us to affiliated independent
distributors represented 24.2% of our revenue in France over the same period. As of August 31,
2016, we had a network of 33 wholly-owned distributors and 44 affiliated independent
distributors in France. These distributors operate out of 493 distribution sites, comprising 307
wholly-owned and 186 affiliated distribution sites, which are supplied either by our four
warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle collision repair parts and one for
truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use a customized IT system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44
distribution sites. In Benelux, we have operated three warehouses and 107 affiliated distribution
sites since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition.


1


-----

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 70,000 regular
professional customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

Of the €846.1 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 52.6%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
16.4%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.2%; and
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.8%. The remaining €270.8 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2016, was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Our strengths

**_Attractive, stable and resilient light vehicle aftermarket_**

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car parc”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has generally proven
resilient during economic downturns, when new car sales tend to decline. This resilience is due in
part to several positive trends that we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a stable
car parc size, a continuing increase in the average age of the car parc, increasingly complex and
technologically advanced vehicle parts, and advantageous regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions
in which we operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in which we
operate has led to an increase in the average age of the car parc, resulting in a growing share of
cars beyond the manufacturer warranty period and in need of repair and maintenance.
Independent garages sourcing IAM-provided spare parts create value for owners of such beyondwarranty period cars looking for an alternative to generally more expensive manufacturers’
dealers’ garages.

**_Leading distributor in the profitable French independent aftermarket sector_**

We are the leading distributor of parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in France, with
over 50 years of experience. As of August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to the Doyen
Auto Acquisition, we held an estimated market share in excess of 22% in terms of revenue in the
fragmented French light vehicle IAM. Our leading position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand
and our extensive distribution network provide us with a strong platform to deliver a broad
range of spare parts, equipment and tools on a timely and efficient basis. We enjoy a strong
regional position in the light vehicle IAM in Poland, through our wholly-owned distributors in
southern Poland, and in Benelux, since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability for customers. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive


2


-----

distribution network organized around our central purchasing departments, four specialized
national warehouses and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for the
direct supply of spare parts and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are
handled separately from our logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the
supplier, we use a customized IT system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain
and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our
distribution system is also capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to
efficiently handle high volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and,
ultimately, driving increased customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution
system taking into account each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our
operational flexibility and efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of
service to our customers. For example, we separated our light vehicles and trucks spare product
lines into two distinct business units in order to optimize their supply chains and capitalize on
their respective efficiencies.

Our vertically integrated distribution system and extensive network of distributors and garages
provide us with a competitive advantage over smaller operators because smaller operators lack
our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a founding partner of
the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest European purchasing networks of
independent distributors for spare parts, which further enhances our purchasing power, allows us
to obtain rebates and gives us access to best practices of other AD International partners abroad.
We believe that the advantages of our vertically integrated distribution system are difficult to
replicate because of the significant time and resources that would be required to reproduce our
existing infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a large
customer base of light vehicle and truck garages across France and Benelux. As of August 31,
2016, we served more than 70,000 regular professional customers in France, including our
approximately 3,200 branded garages, and several hundred thousand individual professional
customers. We service our customers through both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent
distributors. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, 75.7% of our revenue in France was
generated by sales to garages and over-the-counter sales through our wholly-owned distributors,
and 24.2% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors
that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient distribution network and
our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on a timely and efficient
basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to develop and maintain our
large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers targeted by our wholly-owned
distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not overlap due to the commercial
arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated independent distributors. In addition, we
are focused on developing new customer segments, such as online retailers that are major
customers of Doyen Auto. We have also set up a separate sales department dedicated to
insurance clients in order to strengthen our commercial relationships with these companies and
increase our share of the collision repair market.

**_High-quality service based on extensive product portfolio, highly efficient operations and_**
**_customized IT systems_**

Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately one million commonly used spare parts from
over 281 suppliers, including a new product line for windscreens. We believe that our suppliers
view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for the IAM, which allows
us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse range of suppliers. This is
because we are one of the few distributors in our market with the scale, warehouse logistics,
distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and distribute a large number of
spare parts, equipment and tools for an increasingly complex market with high barriers to entry.
We also believe that this gives us an advantage against competition from OES, which need to
combine their historical OES activities with the complex IAM market and would require


3


-----

investment in a broader product assortment, availability of parts and logistics in order to
compete with the range of products we distribute, the availability of parts we offer, our strong
logistics and the quality of our services. The number of car and truck brands and models in the
car park continues to increase and, as a result, the related assortment of car and truck spare parts
increases each year. We believe that our extensive product portfolio, combined with our
extensive range of services, make us attractive to the growing number of multi-brand garages
that are moving away from single-brand, manufacturer specific dealers.

Our logistics platforms are well invested and allow us to operate industry-leading distribution
networks. As of August 31, 2016, Logisteo, our central warehouse from which we distribute spare
parts for light vehicle repair and maintenance, was the largest independent logistics platform for
light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France, with over 20,000 square meters of
storage space that stored approximately 56,800 spare parts references of 124 brands. It supplies
493 distribution sites, comprising 307 wholly-owned and 186 affiliated distribution sites, and
employs approximately 280 people. Since July 2015, we have made significant investments in the
automation of the processes in our Logisteo warehouse in order to improve the accuracy and
speed with which products are delivered to customers and increase our product offering. As of
August 31, 2016, we had already invested €16.4 million in this project and expect that completion
of the project during the course of the next nine months will generate cost savings for us in the
long term. In 2013, we also invested in the expansion of our call center for our collision repair
service in order to improve the quality of our service for our collision business customers.

Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platforms allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items
and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online business-tobusiness car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and Truckissimo,
respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly order from a
large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby improving the
customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe that these web portals
provide us with a competitive advantage, and approximately €138.7 million, or 21.0%, of our
revenue from sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, were placed
through our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services
we offer drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.

Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. In late 2013 and early 2014, we upgraded the warehouse IT management
system of our light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the
process of upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a
tablet-based program that allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and
to make suggestions for purchases based on the customer’s profile. We believe that our IT
systems provide us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a
timely and efficient basis.

As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts, equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to operate
efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our marketleading positions. As a result, we have made, and expect to continue to make in the future,
appropriate investments in IT.

**_Strong financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light_**
**_business model_**

Since 2013 we have generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin from 4.9%
to 7.6%, and maintained stable cash flow generation despite a slowdown in economic activity in
France in recent years, with a cash conversion (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital


4


-----

expenditure, divided by Adjusted EBITDA) of 68.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013,
73.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, 70.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
72.0% for the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2016, and a cash conversion (excluding
exceptional capital expenditure) of 86.9% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We
have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement during the last six years by implementing a
series of profit enhancement measures. Since these measures were implemented, our Adjusted
EBITDA has increased from €29 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, to €93.7 million
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. These measures include, among others: the
maximization of suppliers’ rebates via increased purchasing by our central purchasing
departments and integrated Group-wide purchasing (including our affiliated independent
distributors), cost reductions in the aggregate compensation of local management and
administration through the implementation of shared services, and reductions in transportation
and logistics costs by optimizing the delivery routes between our distribution sites and our
customers and increasing the use of central distribution facilities. In addition, we improved our
cash flows from operating activities (including changes in working capital and other items with
cash effect) from €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to €54.4 million for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We operate a capex-light business model using rented
facilities, and thus our operations do not require us to own or maintain extensive physical
infrastructure. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, our capital expenditures
amounted to 2.8% of our revenue and consisted of maintenance expenditures for our
distribution facilities, and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems, as well
as our first investment in Logisteo’s automation process development. Our low levels of
maintenance capital expenditure requirements (as a percentage of revenue) have allowed us to
invest in our business, maintain our leading market positions, improve operating efficiency and
achieve deleveraging through Adjusted EBITDA growth and cash generation.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, and our Group CFO, Christophe
Gouthière, have more than 70 years of combined experience in the distribution and light vehicle
sectors and have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth
strategies. Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, is the former co-CEO of the Rhiag Group, a leading
distributor in the Italian, Swiss and Eastern European light vehicle aftermarkets, and has
extensive experience in the light vehicle aftermarket. Our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, is the
former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Our Group
CFO, Christophe Gouthière, was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading
distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our Chairman, Group CEO and Group CFO, supported by
an experienced management team, have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated new businesses into our Group. For example, our management team successfully
integrated ACR in 2014 and timely realized slightly higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time of the ACR Acquisition. We believe that
the success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and returning
our business to profitable growth has laid a solid foundation for further growth and increased
profitability. The support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain
Capital, will supplement the leadership and expertise of our management team.

### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience and a focus on the breadth of product
assortment, availability of parts, strong logistics and quality of customer service, we believe that
we are well positioned to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light
vehicle IAM. To accomplish this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our
sales force performance and practices, develop new key accounts, expand our commercial


5


-----

relationships with fast-fitters and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain for express orders.
We may also seek from time to time to make selective acquisitions that are accretive to our
network. As part of this strategy, we acquired ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, and are
currently considering the acquisition of another small spare parts distributor. The latter
transaction is at an early stage, and is subject to completion of due diligence and the negotiation
of contractual documentation. There is therefore no assurance that we will complete it in the
near term or at all. Should we complete such acquisition, we expect to finance it with cash from
operations and existing liquidity lines, and we believe that it would have no materially negative
impact on our ratio of net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Doyen Auto is a distributor of
spare parts for light vehicles in France and Benelux. For the twelve months ended August 31,
2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of €196.0 million and €8.9 million,
respectively.

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a CAGR of 11.9% between 2010 and 2015.
We intend to leverage our logistics platforms, competitive prices and high levels of service to
continue to win new contracts with insurance companies for our collision repair services. We plan
to channel this business to our branded garages in order to strengthen our partnerships with
such garages and insurers and increase demand for the provision of collision repair parts from
our distributors.

**_Enhance customer service_**

We intend to continue to enhance our high-quality service to our customers by ensuring seamless
execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already extensive product
assortment. We believe that timely product delivery, our range of spare parts on offer, and
efficient and effective order execution will continue to drive customer loyalty. We plan to
shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. The ACR Acquisition has
allowed us to benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its specialization
in deliveries within two to four hours of placing an order. With the completion of the Doyen
Auto Acquisition, we have increased our ability to deliver spare parts in rural areas of France,
where a majority of API distributors are located. We will also benefit from Doyen Auto’s
experience in sales to online retailers to enhance the quality of our services in this segment. We
seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to capture
market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand our
portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line for
the light vehicle and truck aftermarket and the private label product line of ACR for the light
vehicle aftermarket. We plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We believe
that this approach will allow us to address different types of customers with different value
propositions, ultimately optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase in
private label product lines as a percentage of our total revenues will improve our
competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources
and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations and reduce
fixed costs in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further standardize our central
administration and enhance our IT support in order to implement these changes. In addition, we
intend to continue to invest in our logistics platforms in order to reduce costs, facilitate
operational efficiencies, strengthen our supply chain and provide our customers with better
product coverage and availability. For example, we aim to open a new logistics platform in Réau,
France in 2017. By further enhancing existing software and installing new software, such as the
recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform,


6


-----

we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of orders. We also intend to
further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our EBITDA margins in Poland pursuant
to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, we expect
Doyen Auto to realize purchasing savings by purchasing spare parts under our existing
arrangements with our suppliers, which provide better commercial terms compared to Doyen
Auto’s contracts. We estimate that the integration of Doyen Auto will result in approximately
€12.6 million of identified annualized anticipated purchasing and cost savings. Additionally, we
are focused on increasing the share of purchases made by our affiliated independent distributors
through our central purchasing departments, which we expect will further increase our sales
volumes and improve our purchasing power.

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 9.3% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, which target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. The integration of ACR in 2014, which serves
online light vehicle spare parts retailers, increased our presence in this segment of the IAM.
Whether an order is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely
over-the-counter product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to onlineonly light vehicle spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts.
We regularly assess our over-the-counter sales vis-à-vis our existing business-to-business sales
objectives in terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our over-the-counter
sales on our business-to-business sales.

**_Integrate Doyen Auto into our business_**

Upon completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, Doyen Auto became an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer. Doyen Auto is a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles in
the IAM in France and Benelux, mainly through its network of affiliated distributors API (165
distributors), and serves a diverse customer base, including online retailers, affiliated distributors
and two networks of branded garages, 1,2,3 AutoService (297 garages) and Requal (435 garages).
The Doyen Auto Acquisition has increased our market share in the French spare parts
aftermarket, has given us a leading position in the fast-growing online retail segment, in which
Doyen Auto is already a leader in France, has expanded our business to Benelux and, we believe,
will enable us to realize further significant procurement, logistics and distribution savings and
cost efficiencies.

Following the integration of Doyen Auto into our business using an approach similar to that used
for the successful integration of ACR, we expect to realize approximately €12.6 million of
annualized anticipated purchasing and cost savings (compared to 2015 costs) based on a report
prepared by Kepler S.A.S., a consultant that we hired in connection with the Doyen Auto
Acquisition. We expect to realize €10.6 million of identified purchasing savings per year resulting
from having Doyen Auto purchase spare parts under our existing arrangements with our
suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms, compared to Doyen Auto’s existing supply
contracts, in line with the renegotiating strategy that we successfully implemented following the
ACR Acquisition. These savings are expected to come into effect simultaneously with the
integration of Doyen Auto into our business, which we expect to be largely completed in the first
half of 2017, and without additional cost. We also expect to realize approximately €2 million of
additional annualized cost savings by the end of 2018 (compared to 2015 costs) from the

integration of corporate, IT and other central functions and through optimization of our
footprint, particularly in France. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We may face
_challenges in integrating acquired businesses and in integrating any future potential acquisition,_
_and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these businesses and any other cost_
_improvement measures we have taken.”_

### The Refinancing

On the Issue Date, we will issue the Notes offered hereby and use the proceeds of the Offering
to: (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Notes Redemption; (ii) make a distribution to HoldCo to
fund the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption; (iii) repay all amounts outstanding
under the Bridge Facility; and (iv) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Refinancing. See “Use of proceeds.”

The Offering and the application of the proceeds from the Offering are collectively referred to in
this Offering Memorandum as the “Refinancing.”

**_Existing Senior Secured Notes Redemption_**

Concurrently with, and conditioned on, the closing of the Offering, the Issuer will redeem the
entire aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes by paying the
redemption price for the Existing Senior Secured Notes set forth in this Offering Memorandum
(the “Existing Senior Secured Notes Redemption”). See “Use of proceeds.”

**_Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption_**

Concurrently with, and conditioned on, the closing of the Offering, the Issuer will distribute,
indirectly, a portion of the proceeds of the Offering to HoldCo. HoldCo will use the proceeds of
such distribution to redeem €140.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior HoldCo PayIf-You-Can Notes by paying the redemption price for the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes set
forth in this Offering Memorandum (the “Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption”).
See “Use of proceeds.” Following the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption, €99.0
million in aggregate principal amount of Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes will remain
outstanding.

**_Repayment of the Bridge Facility_**

Concurrently with, and conditioned on, the closing of the Offering, the Issuer will repay the
€80.0 million outstanding under the Bridge Facility with a portion of the proceeds of the
Offering. We used the proceeds of the Bridge Facility to fund the consideration payable to Doge
Invest for the shares of DA and Ariane, the two holding companies of the Doyen Auto group, on
the completion date of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, to finance the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Doyen Auto Acquisition and for general corporate purposes. See “—Recent
_developments—Doyen Auto Acquisition.”_

### Recent developments

**_Current trading_**

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated revenue of approximately
€918.5 million, an increase of approximately 0.6% compared to our revenue for the
corresponding period in 2015. We generated approximately €834.5 million of our revenue in
France for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately
€829.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €73.5 million, an increase
of approximately 12.4% compared to our Adjusted EBITDA for the corresponding period in 2015.
We generated approximately €72.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA in France for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately €64.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in revenue, excluding the effect of acquisitions and disposals,
was primarily due to an increase in sales of light vehicle spare parts and the continuing positive
performance of our body parts product line. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due
to the higher purchasing power of our central purchasing departments and the performance of
our distributors of spare parts for light vehicles, as well as management initiatives in respect of
cost efficiencies.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA of approximately €130.5 million and approximately €5.5 million, respectively.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, we generated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(including Doyen Auto) of approximately €114.5 million, €0.7 million lower than the Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, due to
lower revenue for Doyen Auto in September, prior to the Doyen Auto Acquisition.

This information is based on internal management accounts and has been prepared under the
responsibility of our management, and has not been audited, reviewed or verified; no procedures
have been completed by our auditors with respect thereto, and you should not place undue
reliance thereon. This information is subject to confirmation in our audited consolidated financial
statements and report for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consequently, upon publication of
our unaudited results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or of our audited results
for the year ended December 31, 2016, we may report results that are different from the ones set
forth in this section.

**_Doyen Auto Acquisition_**

On September 30, 2016, Autodistribution S.A. acquired the entire issued share capital of DA and
Ariane, the two holding companies of the Doyen Auto group, from Doge Invest pursuant to an
acquisition agreement dated June 27, 2016, between the Parent Guarantor and Doge Invest (the
“Doyen Auto Acquisition”) for a cash purchase price of approximately €74.8 million (including
post-closing price adjustments). Doyen Auto is a Belgium-headquartered distributor of
aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles with operations in France and Benelux. For the twelve
months ended August 31, 2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue of €196.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of €8.9 million. We financed the Doyen Auto Acquisition by using drawings under the
Bridge Facility. For more information on Doyen Auto, see “Business—History—Doyen Auto
_Acquisition.”_

We estimate that the integration of Doyen Auto will result in approximately €12.6 million of
annualized anticipated purchasing and cost savings (compared to 2015 costs) based on a report
prepared by Kepler S.A.S., a consultant that we hired in connection with the Doyen Auto
Acquisition. We expect to realize €10.6 million of identified purchasing savings per year resulting
from having Doyen Auto purchase spare parts under our existing arrangements with our
suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms, compared to Doyen Auto’s existing supply
contracts, in line with the renegotiating strategy that we successfully implemented following the
ACR Acquisition. These savings are expected to come into effect simultaneously with the
integration of Doyen Auto into our business, which we expect to be largely completed in the first
half of 2017, and without additional cost. We also expect to realize approximately €2 million of
additional annualized cost savings by the end of 2018 (compared to 2015 costs) from the

_improvement measures we have taken.”_

**_Intercreditor Agreement and Revolving Credit Facility amendments_**

On or about the Issue Date, we will make certain technical amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility, in order to align those agreements with the terms of
the Indenture. See “Description of certain financing arrangements.”

(3) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering to: (i) redeem the entire outstanding principal amount
of the Existing Senior Secured Notes; (ii) repay amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility; (ii) make a distribution to
HoldCo in order to fund the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption; and (iv) pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Refinancing. HoldCo will use the proceeds of the Offering received from the Issuer to fund the Senior
HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption. See “Use of proceeds” and “—The Refinancing.”

(4) The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future
obligation of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer
under the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any), will rank senior in right of payment to any
existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will be
effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any), that are secured by property and assets of the subsidiaries of
the Issuer that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets.

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) by Autodis Group S.A.S. (the “Parent Guarantor”) and
Autodistribution S.A. (the “Subsidiary Guarantor,” and together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors”). As of and for
the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 56.4% of the consolidated total assets, 17.4% of the
consolidated revenue and 35.2% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. The Guarantees will be subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will also be limited as necessary to
prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise reflect limitation under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to
an amount not greater than the amount of existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €134 million and corresponds to
the aggregate of the existing proceeds loan of €54 million made available to on-lend the proceeds of the issuance of the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and the existing proceeds loan of €80 million made available to on-lend the amount drawn
under the Bridge Facility, in each case, to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be
similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance
_laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our_
_indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not_
_be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes,_
_the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability_
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
will be secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of the share capital of LuxCo 6; (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock,
material bank accounts and material intragroup receivables of the Parent Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital
stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over certain assets of the
Issuer, including the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its
material bank accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and (v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of
Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A., (B)
Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.’s material intragroup receivables. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging obligations (if any) (the
“Super Senior Obligations”) are secured by first-priority security interests over, among others, the Collateral, contractually
ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the
event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral
only after the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The security interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to
recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law considerations
_and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

(5) The Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for drawings of up to €50.0 million, all of which will be available for
borrowing on the Issue Date. Our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by security interests over, among
other things, the Collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the
security interests over the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after lenders
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, creditors of any future indebtedness incurred that is permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu on the enforcement of the Collateral with the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to future hedging arrangements (if any) have been repaid in full. Any
remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment of
all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to
be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The indebtedness of
the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by, and is secured by certain assets of, certain
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee, and do not provide security in favor of, the Notes. See “Description of certain
_financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(6) Autodistribution S.A. and several of our other subsidiaries have entered into various factoring, working capital and bilateral
lending facilities with an aggregate principal amount of €23.4 million outstanding as of August 31, 2016, after giving effect
to the Doyen Auto Acquisition and excluding bank overdrafts. These factoring arrangements and the working capital and
bilateral lending facilities will remain in place after the Refinancing. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Other financing arrangements.”_

(7) Certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended August
31, 2016, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries
and intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for 43.6% of the consolidated total assets, 82.6% of the consolidated
revenue and 64.8% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. As of August 31, 2016, and after giving pro forma
effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition and the Refinancing, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor had €23.4
million of debt outstanding (excluding bank overdrafts). See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—
_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

                     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or

As of and for the twelve months ended August 31,

intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for
56.4% of the consolidated total assets, 17.4% of the

consolidated revenue and 35.2% of the consolidated
EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee
will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance
or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law,
or otherwise reflect limitations under applicable law.
By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation
under its Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under
its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of the
Subsidiary Guarantor is expected to be limited in
value to an amount not greater than the amount of
existing proceeds loans, which is approximately
€134 million and corresponds to the aggregate of the
existing proceeds loan of €54 million made available
to on-lend the proceeds of the issuance of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes and the existing proceeds loan
of €80 million made available to on-lend the amount
drawn under the Bridge Facility, in each case, to the
Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the
Guarantors may not be similarly limited See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the_

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes are secured by: (i) a first-priority pledge of
the share capital of LuxCo 6; (ii) a first-priority pledge
of the capital stock, material bank accounts and
material intragroup receivables of the Parent
Guarantor; (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital
stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis
shareholdings); (iv) first-priority security interests over
certain assets of the Issuer, including the capital stock
of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A.
and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, its material bank
accounts and its material intragroup receivables; and
(v) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of
Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad
S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by
Autodistribution S.A., (B) Autodistribution S.A.’s
material bank accounts and (C) Autodistribution S.A.’s
material intragroup receivables. See “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”_

The Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging
obligations (if any) (the “Super Senior Obligations”)
are secured by first-priority security interests over,
among other things, the Collateral, contractually
ranking pari passu with the security interests securing
the Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the
security interests over the Collateral, holders of Notes
will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after
the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The
security interests in the Collateral are limited as
necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those
that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. For a brief description of such
limitations, see “Certain insolvency law considerations
_and limitations on the validity and enforceability of_
_the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the firstpriority security interests securing the Notes are
contractually deemed to rank equally with the
security interests that secure (but only to the extent
that such security is expressed to secure those
liabilities) (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) certain obligations under hedging
arrangements and (iii) certain other future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture (including to the extent such indebtedness
shares in these security interests, future subordinated
notes). Such security interests are, or will be,
evidenced by security documents for the benefit of
(whether directly or through the Security Agent) the
holders of the Notes, the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility and/or the holders of certain other


17


-----

future senior or subordinated indebtedness and
obligations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event
of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes,
including from the enforcement of the Guarantees or
the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness
in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank
_pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and_
future hedging obligations (if any) in priority to the
Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of
the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or
delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other
creditor representative of future senior or
subordinated indebtedness permitted under the terms
of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
relevant security unless instructed by the relevant
Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such
other class of creditors as specified by the
Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain
conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security Agent
to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in
accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement. In the event of conflicting instructions,
the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions as to
which set of instructions will prevail. See “Description
_of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**Optional redemption**

Fixed Rate Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate
Notes on or after, 2018 at the redemption
prices set forth under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional redemption—Senior Secured_
_Fixed Rate Notes,” plus accrued and unpaid interest_
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption.

Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may on any one or
more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes issued under
the Indenture (including the original principal amount
of any additional Notes), using the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal
to of the principal amount of
the Fixed Rate Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the applicable date of redemption;
provided that at least 50% of the original principal
amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (including the
original principal amount of any additional Fixed Rate
Notes) issued under the Indenture (excluding Fixed


18


-----

Rate Notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries)
remains outstanding after each such redemption.

Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed
Rate Notes originally issued (including the aggregate
principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in
each calendar year, commencing on the Issue Date, at
a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, up to the redemption
date. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Optional_ _redemption—Senior_ _Secured_ _Fixed_ _Rate_
_Notes.”_

In addition, prior to, 2018, the Issuer may
redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Fixed
Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable
“make-whole” premium described in this Offering
Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable date of redemption.

Floating Rate Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate
Notes on or after, 2017 at the redemption
prices set forth under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional redemption—Senior Secured_
_Floating_ _Rate_ _Notes,”_ plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption.

Prior to, 2017, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Floating Rate Notes plus the applicable
“make-whole” premium described in this Offering
Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the
applicable date of redemption.

**Additional amounts; Tax Redemption . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a
Guarantor in respect of the Notes or a Guarantee will
be made without withholding or deduction for any
taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction, except to the
extent required by law. If any such withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain
exceptions and limitations, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, will pay additional amounts
so that the net amount received is no less than that
which would have been received in the absence of
such withholding or deduction. See “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” The_
Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in
part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a
result of certain changes in tax law the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay
additional amounts with respect to the Notes. If the
Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it
must pay a price equal to 100% of the principal


19


-----

amount of the Notes plus interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Senior_ _Secured_ _Notes—_
_Redemption for taxation reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control, the
holders of the Notes will have the right to require the
Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
such repurchase. A change of control, however, will
not be deemed to have occurred if a consolidated net
senior secured leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Change of control.”_

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture.
The Indenture limits, among other things, the ability
of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and the restricted
subsidiaries of the Issuer to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and
issue certain preferred stock;

                   - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make
certain investments;

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                       - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries
to pay dividends or make other payments to us;

                       - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including
subsidiary stock;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                    - amend certain documents; and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes.

Additionally, the Indenture limits the ability of LuxCo
5, LuxCo 6, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer to
engage in certain business and other activities.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of
significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_covenants” and the related definitions._

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for
as long as we achieve investment-grade ratings and
following a qualifying initial public offering of the
capital stock of any direct or indirect parent entity of
the Issuer. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain covenants—Suspension of covenants_
_on achievement of Investment Grade Status” and_

# Summary consolidated financial and other information

The following tables set forth our summary consolidated financial information and other data for
the periods ended and as of the dates indicated below. Our summary consolidated financial
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 has been derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, an English translation of which is included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, have been audited by our auditors and free
English-language translations of their audit reports are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The summary consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013, included in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from the
comparative information contained in the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014. The consolidated financial
statements of the Parent Guarantor included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared
in accordance with IFRS.

Our summary consolidated interim financial information as of and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015 and 2016, has been derived from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the eight months ended August 31,
2016, with corresponding income statement and cash flow data for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The historical
unaudited financial information for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, has been
prepared using the same accounting principles as the financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and contains all adjustments that management considers necessary for
a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor
have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the IFRS standard
applicable to interim financial statements. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the eight months ended August 31,
2016, have been reviewed by our auditors and their review report is included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended August
31, 2016, has been derived by adding the consolidated financial information of the Parent
Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, to the consolidated financial
information of the Parent Guarantor for the eight months ended August 31, 2016, and
subtracting the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015. The financial information for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016,
has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our
results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This
information has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors.

We have also presented summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other data
prepared to give effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition as if it had occurred on September 1, 2015.
The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that
we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other
data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of
operations or other financial information actually would have been if the Doyen Auto
Acquisition had occurred on September 1, 2015, or on any other date and such data do not
purport to project the results of operations for any future period.

The following information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s discussion and
_analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial_
statements and the related notes thereto, an English translation of which is included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. Our historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may
be expected for any future period.

(10) Pro forma net interest expense represents our net interest expense for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, as adjusted
as if the Refinancing had been completed as set forth in “Use of proceeds” and the Doyen Auto Acquisition had been
completed on September 1, 2015. Pro forma interest expense is based on the actual interest rate for the Fixed Rate Notes and
assumes a constant EURIBOR rate for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, for the Floating Rate Notes, and reflects the
fact that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn during such period. Pro forma net cash interest expense includes
commitment fees on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility but does not include any charges related to debt issuance costs in
connection with this Offering. Pro forma cash interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issuance of the Notes occurred on the date
assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at any future
date.

# Risk factors

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering carefully, in_
_light of the circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below_
_before investing in the Notes. If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business,_
_results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected and,_
_accordingly, the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or_
_part of any investment in the Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented does not_
_necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the_
_individual risk factor. Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the_
_only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we_
_currently consider to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_results of operations or financial condition._

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein exclude Doyen_
_Auto._

### Risks related to our business

**_Material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network, or significant_**
**_increases in transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As of August 31, 2016, our distribution network infrastructure in France was composed of our
central purchasing departments, four main warehouses (one for each of light vehicle parts, light
vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts, and one for ACR), connected to 33 wholly-owned
distributors (operating 307 sites) and 44 affiliated independent distributors (operating 186 sites).
Of the total value of all products that we purchased from our referenced suppliers in France
during the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, products representing approximately 50% in
value were delivered through our four main warehouses to our wholly-owned and affiliated
distributors and products representing approximately 50% in value were delivered directly to our
distributors by spare parts manufacturers. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44
distribution sites. Since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we also sell vehicles spare
parts in Benelux, where we now operate three logistics platforms. We rely on road
transportation for the prompt transfer of the products that we distribute from our warehouses
or distribution sites directly to our customers.

A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites in France, Poland or
Benelux or to our transportation network caused, for example, by weather-related problems,
employee strikes, lock-outs and inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events,
could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner or at all, which, in turn,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any damages that may arise or to
compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption of our operations.

We are dependent on third parties for the transportation of orders, and this service could also be
disrupted. In the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, transportation costs accounted for 3.7%
of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time,
particularly in connection with oil prices, and increased transportation costs could result in
reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of
transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and are dependent on the ability_**
**_of our third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements._**

We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and, therefore, rely on over 281
third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts, equipment and tools
that are essential to our business. Our business and, ultimately, our results of operations are
dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us with such products. Our suppliers may fail to

30


-----

meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply with our quality
requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may in the
future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production
difficulties, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in
manufacturing costs or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their
production.

Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including
closures of one of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical
breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, terrorist attacks, financial distress or
bankruptcy, as well as political upheaval, adverse economic events or logistical complications,
weather, natural disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing or other events. Any
short-term or prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the
event that one or more of our major suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties
and we are unable to secure alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially beneficial
terms, we may experience inventory shortages which could result in unfilled customer orders and
lost revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery method, as well as damage to our business
reputation.

If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our
presently agreed terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at
favorable prices, our margins will likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if there is
a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a significant increase in
customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or procure in
time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

**_Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic and other conditions in France,_**
**_Poland, Benelux and worldwide._**

The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by economic
conditions in France, Poland, Benelux and worldwide, and our business is impacted by growth in
the French and the global economy. The light vehicle spare parts aftermarket tends to be
affected in the early period of a recession, when end-customers delay the maintenance of their
light vehicles. The truck spare parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare parts
aftermarket, due to the correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic
conditions. Simultaneously, de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which
may cause short- to medium-term decreases in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck
spare parts. France is our principal geographic market, representing 90.8% of our revenue in the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish light
vehicle IAM, where we generated 9.2% of our revenue over the same period. Since the Doyen
Auto Acquisition, we also operate our business in Benelux. Economic uncertainty in our main
markets, especially France, and globally, could decrease consumer confidence and consumer and
business spending on vehicle maintenance, or less frequent visits by our customers to our
garages, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength
of a subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in France. If the light vehicle and truck spare
parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to economic conditions, it could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continued uncertainty in
global economic conditions (particularly in the eurozone) also poses a risk to our existing
contractual arrangements and the fulfillment of obligations by us, our product suppliers or our
customers. If the current economic situation deteriorates significantly or if one or more eurozone
countries were to depart from the euro, our business could be materially adversely impacted.

We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in
forms of increased employee costs and increased costs of operational costs. Any failure to pass
such increases in costs on to our customers could impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

31


-----

Furthermore, our business and financial results may be adversely affected by factors and
conditions that negatively affect the frequency with which our customers visit our garages, such
as terrorism, social unrest and political instability. An actual or perceived terror threat, social
unrest or internal instability in France may negatively affect the frequency of our customers’ visits
to our garages, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operation.

**_Financial difficulties of our customers may require us to write off debts._**

Across each of our business lines, we rely on the ability of our customers to pay for the products
that we distribute. If an affiliated independent distributor or other customer undergoes financial
difficulties, payments can be significantly delayed and ultimately we may not be able to collect
amounts payable to us under our agreements, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain
reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due. There can be no assurance, however, that
such reserves are sufficiently large for the credit risks we face, particularly in relation to our
affiliated independent distributors. Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would
adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our industry is highly competitive._**

We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of
spare parts distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented French, Polish and, since the
completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, Benelux, spare parts aftermarket. We primarily
compete on the basis of product availability, delivery lead time, quality of service, product range
and technical support. Our main competitors are other light vehicle and truck spare parts
distributors in France (such as Groupauto), Poland (such as Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union
Polska) and, since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, Benelux (such as Sator in the
Netherlands and VHIP in Belgium, which are both the property of LKQ), as well as new online
light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors, which mainly compete with us on the basis of
price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before
making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price.

Over time, online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adopt our business-tobusiness distribution and logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare
parts they sell. Furthermore, in certain countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged
that primarily compete on the basis of price and offer lower prices for the spare parts that they
sell, and such low-cost discount distributors may decide to enter the French or one or more of our
main markets. In addition, our competitors that currently purchase spare parts from suppliers on
a decentralized basis may consolidate their purchasing functions across their various operations,
subsidiaries or owned or affiliated distributors, and their purchasing scale may enable them to
purchase spare parts at prices that are lower than we can obtain. As a result, they may be able to
offer certain spare parts to customers at lower prices than we can. Our failure to adapt to these
or other changes in the competitive landscape could result in a low profit margin, decreased
revenue and loss of market share and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers also compete with car dealers such as Peugeot and Renault. Car dealers typically
specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero to four years old and capture a large share of
light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car dealers, however, have
extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term
service programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly
expand (for example, as a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their
warranties beyond the current limits, especially for replacement parts and maintenance items,
these replacements and maintenance parts covered by such extended warranties would likely be
performed by car dealers instead of us. Additionally, car manufacturers such as Peugeot are
increasingly relying on their own logistics platforms to distribute light vehicle and truck spare
parts even outside the usual warranty periods and for all vehicle brands and types, which could
reduce our market share in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our sales depend on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France_**
**_and the length of service intervals._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, number and mileage of
light vehicles and trucks used in France and the length of service intervals. We consider our core
market to be light vehicles and trucks aged over four years. As light vehicles and trucks get older,
expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase. A decline in the age of light
vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and our
services. Likewise, a decline in the number of light vehicles and trucks and in our addressable
spare parts aftermarket could lead to decreased demand for the products that we distribute and
our services. Either of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle
spare parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in
economic conditions, environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs
and the introduction of a road charge for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits in
cities could reduce light vehicle and truck spending. Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting
behavior (for example, through the increased use of public transport or light vehicle sharing) or
continuing urbanization could decrease the average mileage of light vehicles and demand for
the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in demand could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are currently being made at a later date and to a
lesser extent. The technological and qualitative improvements of many light vehicle and truck
components can lead to a decrease in demand for light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could
have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Disruptions in our IT systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

The software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party software companies facilitates
our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other management and
financial information, and to provide management with current inventory levels at our
warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the
availability of any particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend
on the continuous availability and reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the
functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore, subject to operational risks such as the
occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful conduct by third parties. The
performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to effectively
safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to
telecommunication services and from computer viruses. The occurrence of any such events, and
any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services may impair our ability
to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and
to provide management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

For example, we have recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT
management system of our light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our
inventory more efficiently. The implementation of new IT systems may cause organizational
disruptions within our Group. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new warehouse IT
management system, or any future IT systems, will deliver the projected efficiencies.

One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The
implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption
to our existing computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the
implementation of expanded capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our
online sales and/or our business reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid interruptions or disruptions of
such systems. Any failure or inability to maintain and upgrade our IT systems may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative
improvements in new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is
characterized by frequent technical advances and increases in the complexity of existing
components. Certain light vehicle and truck spare parts may feature complex or innovative
technology that can only be maintained by persons with special training or at specialized
garages. This technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation
to a particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air
conditioning systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages
that are the primary end-users of the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the
information and training necessary to maintain the complex technology featured in our endcustomers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be available at
car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the
sophisticated equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in
higher costs or higher capital expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases, it may
no longer be economically feasible for independent garages to offer repair services for particular
light vehicle and truck models or spare parts. Furthermore, sophisticated manufacturing
technology for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their quality and reduces the number
of replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are replaced less
frequently, our revenue could decrease.

The IAM in which we operate differs from the original equipment supplier aftermarket segment
(the “OES”), in which operators are linked to the light vehicle manufacturers who directly supply
them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and repair procedures.
Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks,
independent garages need to develop appropriate technical expertise in newly developed
components. The failure of independent garages to develop the appropriate technical expertise,
or access to the tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand, may
result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by car dealers with
the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small portion of our revenues),
which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and_**
**_enhance our brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient_**
**_number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute._**

We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success
of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand are integral
to the success of our business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require
us to make further investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website
operations. For example, we have developed websites for each of our distributors and garages
and we invest in large customer events, such as an event to develop our brand that we organized
in September 2014. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on
the success of our marketing and merchandising effort, and our ability to provide good customer
experiences. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our
public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may also
be diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and
efficient delivery of quality products, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental
standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and
regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any
failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, we distribute products to approximately 3,200
branded garages and 44 affiliated independent distributors that have entered into affiliation
agreements with us, but which we do not control. These branded garages and affiliated
independent distributors may take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and
reputation.

Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD and Auto
Primo, Autossimo, AD PL and ISOTECH, the “AD” logo, and since the Doyen Auto Acquisition,

34


-----

1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, are key assets of our business. See “Business—Intellectual
_Property.” We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and_
protect our intellectual property rights, but we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken
or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent any violation or challenges to our
intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not be necessary in
order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves
against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other
factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks, which could,
in turn, lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our growth strategy will require us to expand and improve our operations, and risks associated_**
**_with our expansion plans may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Our growth strategy includes, among others, strengthening our market position in France and in
Benelux. We may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or
selected acquisitions, such as the Doyen Auto Acquisition. Acquisitions pose additional risks,
including paying too high a purchase price or the assumption of unexpected liabilities. In
addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise
substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our
acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Our failure to identify suitable
acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. In addition, the
integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel, particularly in
respect of businesses operating in adjacent markets, could be more difficult and time-consuming
than anticipated, which could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees and
customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings.

Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will
require that we continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other
logistics management capabilities, as well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We
will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our information and distribution systems,
controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing new systems, controls and
procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present
challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to
continually evaluate whether personnel with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are
properly allocated in accordance with our growth strategy, and any failure to allocate such
personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth strategy.

Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will
need to make in the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of
our supply chain and make us unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and
new market trends as we have been able to do historically. We may not be able to anticipate all
of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel, systems,
controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands could materially
adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our growth strategy.

**_We may face challenges in integrating acquired businesses and in integrating any future_**
**_potential acquisition, and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these businesses_**
**_and any other cost improvement measures we have taken._**

In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For
example, in 2014, we acquired ACR, and on September 30, 2016, we acquired Doyen Auto. The
integration of an acquired business, such as Doyen Auto or any future potential acquisition,
requires the dedication of management resources that can temporarily divert attention from our
day-to-day business. The process of integration can also interrupt our activities, which can have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For
example, we could face significant challenges in managing and integrating Doyen Auto into our
business. The integration of Doyen Auto into our business will require dedication of
management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business.

35


-----

If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses or any future potential acquisition within
a reasonable time following its acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and
anticipated benefits thereof. In connection with the integration of recently acquired businesses
or integrating any future potential acquisition into our existing operating structure, we will seek
to realize purchasing and cost savings. For example, we acquired Doyen Auto in part with the
expectation that we would be able to integrate into our business the performance of its
distribution network, improve its operating results and realize purchasing and cost savings,
particularly in the areas of procurement. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to fully
integrate Doyen Auto’s operations into our business, or at all, or that we will be in a position to
realize some or all purchasing and cost savings that we anticipated when we acquired Doyen
Auto. To achieve any of the foregoing, we could also be required to make additional capital
expenditures which may be significant. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions
about our ability to implement these measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost
parameters. Our ability to achieve the planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant
number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If one or more of our underlying
assumptions regarding these projects proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to
substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the
anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost measures. Furthermore, pricing
pressure from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the
benefits of the cost measures that we have assumed that we will be able to retain in the
calculation of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto). Also, cost efficiencies from
expected improved logistics and distribution processes may not be sustainable due to changes in
customer needs, environmental law, logistics, transportation costs or other cost variables.

In addition, our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss
of key customers and suppliers. Our inability to realize the anticipated purchasing and cost
savings and revenue enhancements from the Doyen Auto Acquisition or any future potential
acquisition and other measures that we have taken could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a
targeted manner. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify suitable
businesses or investment opportunities and be able to acquire, or make the investment, on
favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all material risks in connection with the acquisition
of a company or the making of investments have been identified in the due diligence process and
may not, therefore, be taken into account when deciding whether to acquire the business or
make the investment. These risks may materialize only after a company has been acquired or an
investment has been made, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related agreements
or by insurance policies. For example, as a result of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we will gain
access to new markets and jurisdictions, including markets in Benelux, and will add Doyen Auto’s
existing distribution network to our network. As a result, we may become exposed to risks
relating to doing business in these markets and jurisdictions, including political, economic and
social risks. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_The products that we provide may be exposed to price and margin pressures, and we may be_**
**_unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers at competitive pricing and_**
**_margin levels._**

We may be forced to decrease prices for the products that we distribute due to a number of
factors, such as challenging macroeconomic conditions or increased competition. In our industry,
both light vehicle and truck spare parts manufacturers set retail prices through official
recommended prices for the end-customer. Each participant in the value chain, including us, then
sets its prices as a percentage of the recommended price on the basis of its targeted gross
margin. We may be unable to compensate for a decrease in recommended retail prices by
obtaining supplier rebates, attracting new business, reducing our operating costs (for example,
through headcount reductions, increases in labor productivity or other gains in cost efficiency) or
otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Price and margin pressures may therefore lead to a reduction in average prices and
margins for our services, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

36


-----

**_A decrease in the number of affiliated independent distributors in our network or a decrease in_**
**_demand for certain key spare parts may adversely impact our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We have entered into affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors and
branded garages. These agreements allow them to use one of our brands, including AD Garage,
Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, 1,2,3 AutoService, Requal and API, and in return the affiliated
distributors designate us as their preferred supplier and the independent garages designate our
distributors as their preferred distributors. We renewed our agreements with our affiliated
independent distributors on April 13, 2015, for a further seven years. Nonetheless, if any of these
distributors were to breach their agreements with us by prematurely terminating their
relationship with us, the size of our distribution network and our customer base could be
reduced and our profitability significantly harmed as a result. In addition, our customers mostly
purchase light vehicle and truck spare parts based on their existing needs, but are not required to
purchase a minimum amount of any of the products that we distribute. Therefore, a significant
decrease in demand for certain key spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the
extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our customers, we will need to
attract new customers or win new business with our existing customers and if we are unable to
do so, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_The departure of members of our management team or other key personnel, or our inability to_**
**_attract and retain qualified management or other key personnel, could have an adverse effect_**
**_on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our success is largely dependent upon the continued service and skills of our existing
management team. If one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or
unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and
our business may be disrupted, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Competition for management and key personnel is intense,
and the pool of qualified candidates is limited, so we may not be able to attract and retain
experienced executive or key personnel in the future, which could hinder our ability to run and
develop our business successfully. In addition, if any of our executives or other key personnel
joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other
key personnel, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and_**
**_employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations
relating to labor, employment, health and safety. The modification, suspension, repeal or
expiration of favorable provisions in labor and employment laws and regulations or, conversely,
any increases of mandatory minimum wages pursuant to laws, regulations or collective
bargaining agreements, or of social security contributions, may negatively impact our business
and profitability. For example, in France we benefit from reductions in employer social security
contributions on certain wages pursuant to law 2003-47 of January 17, 2003, as completed by law
2008–1258 of December 3, 2008 (the “Fillon Law”), as well as from a tax credit for
competitiveness and employment (crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi) (“CICE”).
Pursuant to CICE, French companies receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid in the
course of each calendar year to employees whose wages are less than or equal to 2.5 times the
French statutory minimum wage for 2013 and 6% in 2014 and subsequent years (noting that such
rate could be increased to 7% for salaries paid from January 1, 2017, according to the draft
finance bill for 2017 released by the French government). The Fillon Law allows employers to
benefit from reductions in such social security contributions in respect of wages that amount to
less than 1.6 times the French statutory minimum wage.

Any unfavorable changes in the Fillon Law, CICE or other labor and employment laws and
regulations, or in the terms of collective bargaining agreements applicable to our business, as
well as any increases of the statutory minimum wage in any country or industry in which we
operate, may increase our payroll costs and negatively affect our operating margins and

37


-----

operational flexibility, and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition. In addition, the impact of laws and regulations,
particularly labor and employment laws and regulations, may restrict our ability to achieve cost
reductions and other efficiency gains.

In January 2013, an agreement was reached between national employer representatives and
trade unions in France regarding certain labor market reforms. Many provisions of this
agreement now appear in the law on job security published on June 14, 2013. This law provides,
among other things, additional charges on fixed-term employment contracts, greater regulation
of part-time employment and an extension of the scope of complementary health benefits to all
employees. These measures have been implemented with no material cost impact as of December
31, 2015, but we cannot assess the impact of such new measures on our future operations and
they may have an adverse impact on our costs. Labor market reform in general continues to be a
key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda, and changes in any of the
above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations
could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_French tax legislation may restrict our ability to use French tax loss carry-forwards._**

We may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting
from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in
respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our subsidiaries. The actual realization of these assets in
future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the
future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the
French Tax Code (Code général des impôts), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that
may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to
€1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of the taxable profit exceeding €1 million. Any reduction in
our ability to use these tax assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax
reassessment or lower than expected results could have a negative impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_A deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a failure to extend,_**
**_renew or renegotiate on favorable terms our collective bargaining agreements could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of August 31, 2016, we had 5,995 employees. Maintaining good relationships with our
employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result,
any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. See “Business—Employees.”

Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These
agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other
things, the general working conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours,
holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining
agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability
to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be able to
extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the
expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or
without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to
additional company-specific agreements or amendments to the existing national collective
bargaining agreements. Such additional company-specific agreements or amendments may
increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

While in the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as
a result of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes, such events could disrupt our
operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

38


-----

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

Our labor costs may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce,
salary increases and headcount increases. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs
through increased selling prices or productivity gains. If labor costs increase further, our
operating costs will also increase, which could, if we are unable to recover these cost increases
from our customers through increased selling prices or offset such cost increases through labor
productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Environmental, health and safety regulations relating to our operations could subject us to_**
**_increasing costs or fines._**

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of European directives and
regulations, national, state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment, workers’ health and safety, and the use, management, storage and disposal
of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials. These include, in particular,
requirements governing the disposal of used oil, batteries, tires and other materials processed in
our recycling business. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way in which we conduct
our operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other
penalties.

In addition, various environmental laws also may impose liability on us for the costs of cleaning
up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on our property,
including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and regulations also could require
us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we
disposed of or recycled hazardous substances.

With environmental regulations becoming increasingly stringent, our future costs of complying
with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future,
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and are expected to
continue to be, subject to seasonal and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors.
Factors that could result in cash flow fluctuations include the level of sales and the related
margins of those sales, the collection of receivables, the timing and size of purchases of
inventories and related components, the timing of payments for such purchases, and the terms
and timing of payments for payables and accrued liabilities, as well as prevailing economic
conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we
are unable to manage fluctuations in working capital requirements and cash flow, our business,
results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may be
unable to make required interest payments on our indebtedness.

If our working capital requirements exceed our other cash flows from operations, we would look
to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our financing arrangements to satisfy
those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on
satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our Revolving Credit
Facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are
not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow sufficient funds to meet our
working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures,
refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to sell assets or equity or obtain additional financing on terms
acceptable to us, if at all.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty or recall_**
**_claims that may be brought against us._**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the products that
we sell, particularly the truck spare parts we sell, actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected,

39


-----

or the use of our product results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.
Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and
incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of the products that we
distribute are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of
that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. We may not be able to pass
these liabilities through to the product manufacturer, whether due to unfavorable supplier
warranties or supplier credit issues. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We could face exposure to product liability claims for products that we import from countries_**
**_outside the European Union and sell under our own trademark._**

As a distributor of spare parts, we may be held liable for defective products if we brand products
with our trademark, such as ISOTECH, and present ourselves as the producer of such products or
we distribute products imported from countries outside the European Union. Some of the
products that we distribute are branded with our ISOTECH trademark. In addition, we sell
products imported from countries outside the European Union. By selling products under our
trademark or imported from countries outside the European Union, we may be held liable for
any unforeseen defects in products requiring repair under warranty or recall, which,
notwithstanding possible recourse against the relevant manufacturer and supplier, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, the outcomes
of which are difficult to predict. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which
may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. Although individually these
proceedings do not typically involve substantial amounts, in the aggregate such proceedings or
any increase in the number of such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. As of August 31, 2016, our provision for
litigation amounted to €3.0 million.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a
judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, the costs related to litigation proceedings may be significant. Even if there
is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against
our business or products could adversely affect our reputation and we may still have to bear part
or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants,
insurance or otherwise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. See “Business—Legal proceedings.”

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in
tax laws, including the basis on which CICE is calculated or the elimination of CICE altogether,
could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In
addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject
to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax
authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay
taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, as well as the rules and
regulations of the European Union. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and
proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged

40


-----

infringements of antitrust laws, which could result in fines or other forms of liability, or
otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Such laws and regulations could limit or
prohibit our ability to grow in certain markets.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Bain Capital indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, our shareholders
have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital
structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other
changes to our operations and to control the outcome of matters requiring action by our
shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests
as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our
obligations as they mature. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur
additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in
companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly
with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to
our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In
addition, our shareholders may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the Group. Our
shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments,
although such transactions might involve risks to the Noteholders (as defined herein).

### Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes

**_Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue_**
**_generating operations of its own and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be_**
**_able to make payments on the Notes, as applicable._**

Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company with no business operations
other than the equity interests it will hold in its subsidiaries, and in the case of the Issuer, certain
operations related to the management of our Group. Each of the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor will be dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes and the Parent Guarantor’s obligations under the Parent Guarantee.
The amount of dividends and distributions available to each of the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of
those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law or existing contracts. The subsidiaries
of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted
under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor to make payments in respect of their respective obligations, including under the Notes
and the Parent Guarantee. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Issuer (including all of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than Autodistribution S.A.), that do not guarantee the Notes
have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

The amount enforceable under the Guarantees may be limited, and the validity and
enforceability of the Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the security interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its_
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee
of Autodistribution S.A. is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the
amount of existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €134 million and corresponds to the
aggregate of the existing proceeds loan of €54 million made available to on-lend the proceeds of
the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the existing proceeds loan of €80 million
made available to on-lend the amount drawn under the Bridge Facility, in each case, to the
Subsidiary Guarantor. Other indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited.

None of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries will have any obligation to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose, including subsidiaries that are

41


-----

borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility but do not guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders
of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under
bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

  - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Parent Guarantor
will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

  - the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be
entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. As
of August 31, 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition and the
Refinancing, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries would have had total debt of €23.4 million
(excluding bank overdrafts), all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and
the Guarantees. Any of the debt that the Issuer’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future
in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have and, after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of August 31, 2016,
and as adjusted to give effect to the Doyen Auto Acquisition and the Refinancing, our pro forma
third-party borrowings would have been €543.0 million, which reflects external loans and
borrowings (including finance leases), of which €510.0 million would have been represented by
the Notes. The terms of the Indenture permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to
€50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.”

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations,
including, but not limited to:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our
other debt and liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal
growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate
purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage
or greater financial resources than we have;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business
and industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business
opportunities; and

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds
or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and

42


-----

refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will
depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our
ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to
service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our non-Guarantor
subsidiaries incur will be structurally senior to the Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes, and such debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications
and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Borrowings under debt
instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may
as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these
debts in such circumstances. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leveragerelated risks described above. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture do not
prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other arrangements that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization financings. For a
discussion of our cash flow and liquidity, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
_condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources.”_

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_**
**_factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our
debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including
the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to
pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these
alternatives in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at
such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may
restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find
alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms
that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain
additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able
to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event, borrowings under
other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions
may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts,
including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding
indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could
harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and
resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of

43


-----

material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our
indebtedness, including under the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, restrict our ability
to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able
to consummate certain dispositions or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the
proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be
adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are subject to covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default_**
**_under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture contain covenants that impose significant
restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions,
loans or advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted
subsidiary;

  - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

  - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis;

  - change the “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) of the Luxembourg Security Providers;

  - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

   - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants.” These covenants could limit our
ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and
other business activities that may be in our interest. Our ability to comply with these covenants
and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing
economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions,
in addition to being in default under the Indenture and the Notes, we could be in default under
the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the relevant lenders could elect to
declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately
due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. This would also result in
an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we
enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and
our other debt.

The Revolving Credit Facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy a specified financial
maintenance test in certain circumstances. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a
deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including
increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you
that this test will be met. If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
lenders thereunder could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable.
Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or
cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these
circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other
indebtedness then outstanding, including the Notes. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion_**
**_of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to_**
**_service our indebtedness._**

Under Article 212 § I-(b) of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) the deductibility of
interest paid to a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is
subject to a specific requirement: if the lender is a related party to the borrower within the
meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, the French borrower shall demonstrate, at the
French tax authorities’ request, that the lender is, for the current fiscal year and with respect to
the concerned interest, subject to income tax in an amount that is at least equal to 25% of the
corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules. Where the related-party
lender is domiciled or established outside France, the corporate income tax determined under
standard French tax rules shall mean that to which it would have been liable in France on the
interest received if it had been domiciled or established in France. Specific rules apply where the
lender is a pass-through entity for French tax purposes, a collective investment scheme referred
to in Articles L. 214-1 to L. 214-191 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire
_et financier) (which includes UCITSs and AIFs as well as other collective investment schemes such_
as SICAVs and SPPICAVs with a single shareholder) or, subject to certain conditions, a similar
entity organized under a foreign law.

Pursuant to Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-50, n° 230, dated
August 5, 2014, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of Article 212 § I-b) of the
French Tax Code is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Article 109
_et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under_
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code.

Under Article 212 § II of the French Tax Code, the deduction of interest paid on loans granted by
a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code or on loans granted
by a third party that are guaranteed by a related party (a third party assimilated into a related
party) may be subject to certain limitations. Deduction of interest paid on such loans may be
disallowed in the financial year during which they are accrued if such interest exceeds each of
the following thresholds: (i) the amount of interest multiplied by the ratio of (a) 1.5 times the
company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of indebtedness owed to related parties (or
third parties assimilated into related parties) over the relevant financial year; (ii) 25% of the
company’s earnings before tax and extraordinary items (as adjusted for the purpose of these
limitations); and (iii) the amount of interest received by the indebted company from related
parties. Deduction may be disallowed for the portion of interest that exceeds in a relevant fiscal
year the highest of the above three limitations if such portion of interest exceeds €150,000,
unless the company is able to demonstrate for the relevant fiscal year that the indebtedness ratio
of the group to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio. Specific
rules apply to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups.

In addition, Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code imposes restrictions on the deductibility of
interest expense incurred by a French company if such company has acquired shares of another
company qualifying as “titres de participation” within the meaning of Article 219 I (a) quinquies
of the French Tax Code and if such acquiring company cannot demonstrate, with respect to the
fiscal years running over the twelve-month period from the acquisition of the shares (or with
respect to the first fiscal year opened after January 1, 2012, for shares acquired during a fiscal
year opened prior to such date), that: (i) the decisions relating to such acquired shares are
actually taken by the company having acquired them (or, as the case may be, by a company
controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly controlled by such controlling
company, within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 § I of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce), which is located in France), and (ii) where control or influence is exercised over the_
acquired company, such control or influence is exercised by the acquiring company (or, as the
case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly
controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L. 233 3 § I of the French
Commercial Code, which is located in France).

Moreover, Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code provides for a general limitation of deductibility
of net financial charges, subject to certain exceptions. Adjusted net financial charges incurred by
French companies that are subject to French corporate income tax and are not members of a

45


-----

French tax consolidated group are deductible from their taxable result only up to 75% of their
amount, to the extent that such companies’ financial charges (net of financial income) are at
least equal to €3.0 million in a given fiscal year. Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code,
special rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups. The 75%
limitation is factored on the basis of the group’s consolidated taxable result and applies to the
adjusted aggregate net financial charges incurred by companies that are members of the French
tax consolidated group with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group, to
the extent that the tax group companies’ consolidated financial charges (net of financial income)
are at least equal to €3.0 million in a given fiscal year. Pursuant to Bulletin Officiel des Finances
_Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40 n°70, dated April 30, 2014, the portion of net financial_
expenses that is not deductible by virtue of Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code is not to be
recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code
and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French
Tax Code. This position is very likely to be transposed to the limitation set forth by
Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code.

Finally, the above set of rules restricting the deductibility of interest under French tax law will be
completed in the future. On July 12, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted Council
Directive 2016/1164/EU laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the
functioning of the internal market (the “ATAD”).

The ATAD includes, in particular, a mechanism under which adjusted net financial expenses
incurred by an EU company will be deductible from its taxable results only up to 30% of earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), it being noted that net financial
expenses may be deductible up to an amount of €3.0 million in a given fiscal year. The detailed
implementation of such new rule in France remains largely unknown, including whether this rule
will replace existing French limitation regimes or be added in full or in part to them.

The ATAD should in principle enter into force in January 2019, but this remains uncertain at this
stage. Member States that have, at the date of the entry into force of the ATAD, national
targeted rules for preventing base erosion and profit-shifting risk that have effects similar to the
interest limitation rule set out by the ATAD may apply these targeted rules until the adoption by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) members of a minimum
standard with regard to the four OECD Action Items against Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(which purpose is to limit base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial
payments) or, at the latest, until January 1, 2024.

The above-mentioned tax rules may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the
Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax
burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.

**_The liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished if the proposed financial_**
**_transactions tax or any similar tax were adopted._**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a
common financial transactions tax (the “FTT”) to be implemented under the enhanced
cooperation procedure by Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”). Following the ECOFIN
Council meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the
negotiations.

The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to
certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are
exempt. It would call for the Participating Member States to impose a tax of generally at least
0.1% on all such transactions, generally determined by reference to the amount of consideration
paid. The mechanism by which the tax would be applied and collected is not yet known, but if
the proposed directive or any similar tax is adopted, transactions in the Notes would be subject
to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

Under current proposals, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the

46


-----

Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a
Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in
a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including: (i) by transacting with
a person established in a Participating Member State; or (ii) where the financial instrument that
is subject to the transactions is issued in a Participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation. As of October 10, 2016, the European
Commission has been tasked with drafting the legislation that will be submitted to the
Participating Member States in order to reach a political agreement on the FTT by the end of
2016. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
consequences of the FTT associated with subscribing for, purchasing, holding and disposing of
the Notes.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_**
**_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer is required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we
cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would
have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes
or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases.
A change of control may result in an event of default under, or the acceleration of, our Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. Furthermore, the repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of
control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its respective subsidiaries to
allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control,
may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control
occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the
purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Senior_ _Secured_
_Notes—Change of control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not_
necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us
that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting
power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as
defined in the Indenture).

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control
will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a
certain consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and its subsidiaries is met.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially
all,” there is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,

47


-----

in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the_**
**_Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_**
**_Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral._**

The Guarantors guarantee and provide security in respect of, and the Luxembourg Security
Providers provide security in respect of, the payment of the Notes on a senior basis. The
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of France
and Luxembourg, respectively. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the
Guarantors or the enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral will be subject to certain
defenses available to the Guarantors or a Luxembourg Security Provider in the relevant
jurisdiction, as the case may be. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and
defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges,
preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws
and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under its
Guarantee or the security interest in the Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable
depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or security interest in the Collateral
against any the Guarantor or any Luxembourg Security Provider. See “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests.”_

**_The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared_**
**_unenforceable against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
bankruptcy (the “action paulienne”). The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a
decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the person guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third
party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any
other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant
person by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the
creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, and may be declared unenforceable against
third parties under French law if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do
so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was
performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit) in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of
fraudulent conveyance. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity
_and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in_**
**_the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company that is organized and established under the
laws of France, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are also organized under the
laws of France, and secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg). In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the

48


-----

Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the Collateral, experiences
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. In addition, pursuant to the European Council Regulation
(EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, the court that shall have jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings in relation to a debtor is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) where the debtor has its COMI. Therefore, to the extent that the COMI of the Issuer or
any Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular European jurisdiction, the courts of such
jurisdiction may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings with respect to it, irrespective
of its jurisdiction of incorporation. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in
the European Union and various jurisdictions in the European Union, see “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests.”_

Proceedings could also be initiated in France and Luxembourg to enforce your rights against
Collateral located in those jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be
complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay
regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to
enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question
whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not_**
**_be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce_**
**_your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are
organized and exist under the laws of France, and secured by security interests in the Collateral
provided by the Guarantors, the Issuer and the Luxembourg Security Providers (which are
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in France or Luxembourg. The bankruptcy, insolvency,
administrative and other laws of a Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s jurisdiction of organization may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of
rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain postcommencement interest and duration of the proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes
against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability
of the security interests in the Collateral. The court may also in certain circumstances void the
security interest or the Guarantees where the debtor is close to or near insolvency.

In France, among other limitations, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in
connection with Notes previously issued creates hardening periods for such security interests,
where certain arrangements or disposals that are made during the “hardening period” (période
_suspecte) (a specified period preceding the court decision commencing judicial reorganization or_
liquidation proceedings) may be challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy and certain creditors
under applicable rules of avoidance. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests in the Collateral will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted
or perfected. The Indenture will permit the security interests in the Collateral to be released and
retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening
period. If any such security interest granted or recreated were sought to be enforced before the
end of the applicable hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be
possible to enforce it. See “Certain insolvency law proceedings and the validity and enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—The “hardening period” (période suspecte)_
_in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings.”_

In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a business and
protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of proceedings affecting
creditors, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc) proceedings or conciliation
proceedings (procédure _de_ _conciliation)),_ and court-administered proceedings (safeguard
proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial
reorganization proceedings (redressement _judiciaire)_ or judicial liquidation proceedings
(liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes
or the Guarantees could be limited or suspended.

Under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the Issuer, a
Guarantor or any relevant security provider, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by
specific or general defenses available to debtors under French law, as the case may be, in respect
of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the
Issuer, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain insolvency law
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s, the
Guarantors’ or the Luxembourg Security Providers’ jurisdiction of organization may be materially
different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest
and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them,
could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect
your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain _insolvency_ _law_
_considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests—Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are entities organized under
the laws of France and Luxembourg with their registered offices or principal places of business in
France and Luxembourg. The directors, managers, officers and other executives of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are neither residents nor citizens of the
United States. Furthermore, most of the assets of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Luxembourg
Security Providers or directors, managers, officers and other executives of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Luxembourg Security Providers are located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and
entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be
possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities,
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The United States is not party to a treaty with France or Luxembourg providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and
commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would
not directly be recognized or enforceable in France or in Luxembourg. A party in whose favor
such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France
before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter.

Enforcement in France or Luxembourg of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper
(i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if
the French or Luxembourg court is satisfied that certain conditions have been met. For further
information, see “Enforceability of judgments.”

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to future hedging obligations (if_**
**_any) and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be_**
**_repaid with recoveries from the enforcement of the Guarantee claims and proceeds from the_**
**_enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions that govern the sharing of recoveries from
guarantee claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and
enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is
required to pay turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility or future
hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to
discharge the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or the enforcement of
the Guarantees, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under
the Revolving Credit Facility or future hedging obligations (if any) and future indebtedness are
greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of
Collateral or the enforcement of the Guarantees will, after all obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and such hedging obligations and, if applicable future indebtedness that ranks pari
_passu with the Revolving Credit Facility have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment_
of the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain restrictions with respect to
the use of proceeds from the sale of assets representing the Collateral prior to the maturity date
of the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement—Maturity and repayment requirements.”_

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure
the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As
such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account_**
**_by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale_**
**_of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be
enforced following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount that is due
and remaining unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the
pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors)
or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way
of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors,
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. If the
secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or
private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the
foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial
attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure
(pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire,
an expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value of the
collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and
the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such
securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public
auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public
auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect

51


-----

the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process
and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis
of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of
companies or groups of companies. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Limitations_
_on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”).”_

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-priority
security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the
date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of
the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security
interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction
of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the
Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party,
including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We
cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also
cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate
a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on a contractually first-priority
basis with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness and hedging obligations (the “Super
Senior Liabilities”). The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in
the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes
to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to
take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of
(i) creditors holding more than 66.67% of the indebtedness and commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain other indebtedness permitted to rank pari passu
with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral (a
“Credit Facility”) and the certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior
Creditors”) and (ii) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes,
creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and creditors in respect of
certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which
aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the
“Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor
representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities
have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first
being issued or if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of
enforcement instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the Security
Agent has not commenced any enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided
by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail, provided in each case that they are consistent
with certain security enforcement principles.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting
on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may at
any time (if the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement)) provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if

52


-----

the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good
faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the
realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with
respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance
with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by
the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security
enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an
insolvency event that is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the
instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the
Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such
instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed Enforcement
Instructions (as defined herein) from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the
Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor
representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as a creditor
representative acting on behalf of Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement
instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the
Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted
commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the creditors of any other credit
facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging obligations may have interests that
are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents and other
security interests over the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of
the Issuer or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over
any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents or other
transaction security, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a
result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against
the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale_**
**_of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other
Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and
collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent
that it relates to their assets. So long as no enforcement event or acceleration event has occurred,
the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers may, among other things, without
any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and
making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

53


-----

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

For a description of the security over the Collateral, see “Summary—The Offering—Security.” In
the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of
the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many
factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the
ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are
located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business
would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility or certain hedging
obligations will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the
holders of the pledges securing the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such
distribution with respect to the Notes.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares
or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to
us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will
not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes,
and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of
indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to
secure the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time.

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders
of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third
parties have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the
Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies
with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy
our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture,
holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the
Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the
Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Indenture, to certain restrictions on our ability
to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral, including a Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined and described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior_
Secured Indebtedness (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) for the
purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio contains certain
important exceptions and carve-outs.

**_The security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes
and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees are not granted directly
to the holders of the Notes but have been granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent as security
agent, trustee and Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditor has the right to enforce the Security
Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will
not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except
through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim
secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot

54


-----

be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary
(fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the
Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the
beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the
“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors)
towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal
Obligations”).

Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel
Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond
documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights
(especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a
Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before
French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability
under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Security
Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged
by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds
from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly
important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in the interests of the holders of the
Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass.
com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in
safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be
derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law
applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been
generally recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, among others, the Trustee. To the extent
that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders
of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Trustee.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt
construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the
Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of
_the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Parallel Debt—Trust” and “Certain insolvency_
_law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_

**_Upon a Qualifying IPO, certain Collateral over, or granted by, the Luxembourg Security Providers_**
**_will no longer apply and will be released and the Notes and the remaining Collateral may be_**
**_subject to hardening and other risks._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake a Qualifying IPO (as defined under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain definitions”). In connection with a Qualifying IPO, the_
Collateral over, or granted by, the Luxembourg Security Providers will be released without the
consent of the holders of the Notes and certain covenants described under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants” will no longer apply, including:_

  - “—Centre of main interest”;

  - “—Maintenance of Double LuxCo structure”;

  - “—Limitation on Luxembourg Security Providers”; and

  - “—Limitation on Liens” (with respect to any Luxembourg Security Providers).

A Qualifying IPO would also result in the release of any share pledges granted by the
Luxembourg Security Providers and, as such, the holders of the Notes may not be able to enforce
any relevant security interest in Luxembourg in order to control the Group and avoid safeguard
or accelerated safeguard proceedings that might be initiated by the Issuer’s management. See
“Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests—France.”_

The Guarantors will remain Guarantors under the Notes and be subject to the obligations under
the Indenture. In addition, Liens over any Collateral may be released and material amendments
may be made to any Security Document by the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the
Notes for the purpose of implementing a Qualifying IPO. Any substitution of obligors could be
treated for French law purposes as an exchange of the Notes for new notes. In such a case, new
security documents in respect of the permanent collateral that will remain in place following a
Qualifying IPO may need to be executed. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that such a
substitution may not be void or voidable if it occurred during a hardening period. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—Disapplication of covenants and
_release of Liens on a Qualifying IPO.”_

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes._**

If there is an event of default in the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes. In addition, in
the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over
assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in
certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require,
subject to local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the
Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain
a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain
circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things,
the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being
granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security
principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Luxembourg Security Providers.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing
those Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders
of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes.
As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the
claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of
certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The
security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the
Guarantees if we or the Security Agent are not able to or do not take the actions that are
necessary to perfect any such security interests. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall
have any obligation to take any steps or actions to perfect any of these security interests. Such
failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the
Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third
parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the
same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired
after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and
rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will
monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and
rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect
the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to
monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the
perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security
interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the
Guarantees against third parties. See “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France—Rights in_
_the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_
_Collateral.”_

Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the
Notes do not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority
of the security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the security
interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the
Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a
liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes bear_**
**_interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash_**
**_flow._**

The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes bear
interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR (and in respect of certain
utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, LIBOR), as adjusted periodically (and,
in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, a zero floor applying to EURIBOR/LIBOR), plus a
margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. We may enter into certain
interest rate hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required
to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future,
increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available
for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes or on our
other debt instruments.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be
released automatically as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release of
_Liens,” including, but not limited to:_

  - in the case of Collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or
assets constituting Collateral (as applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not
violate the “Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock” covenant, described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” is otherwise permitted in accordance with the
Indenture;

57


-----

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of the Guarantor; as
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Amendments and waivers”;

  - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Satisfaction and discharge”;_

  - in respect of liens over or granted by any Luxembourg Security Provider, as described
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Disapplication of covenants and release
_of Liens on a Qualifying IPO”;_

  - the property, assets and shares of a restricted subsidiary designated as an unrestricted
subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

  - with respect to all or part of the structural security, as may be permitted by the
“Maintenance of Double LuxCo structure” covenant, as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes”;_

  - in respect of the security provided by LuxCo 5 and LuxCo 6, upon a change of control; and

  - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to and subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its
rights to release the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or
disposal is made:

   - for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

  - pursuant to an auction or other competitive sale process, under the consultation of an
internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm which shall (save in
certain circumstances) opine on the consideration received by giving a fairness opinion.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail
foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor
measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on
the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined in “Tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) may also have important tax_
consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely
affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and
trading of the Notes.

58


-----

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not or will not have been, and are not required to
be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they
may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all
other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is
the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the
United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. For further information,
see “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in
exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes
representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect
of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes
and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must
rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other
actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be
permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may
not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity
of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

59


-----

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on The Channel Island Securities Exchange_**
**_Authority Limited._**

Although the Issuer has, pursuant to the Indenture, agreed to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange within a reasonable period
after the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer
cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or remain, listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the
listing on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain
such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the
Exchange, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of
the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be
able to do so. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of
listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable
issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the
Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the
Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the
secondary market.

# Use of proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be €510.0 million. We intend
to use the gross proceeds from the Offering to: (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Redemption; (ii) make a distribution to HoldCo to fund the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes
Redemption; (iii) repay all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility; and (iv) pay the fees

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM
in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish
light vehicle IAM and, since the acquisition of Doyen Auto on September 30, 2016, in the Benelux
light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to
the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we generated revenue of €1,425.8 million, of which 86.6% was
generated in France and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto) of €115.2 million.
We believe that as of August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto
Acquisition, we held a market share in excess of 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented
French light vehicle IAM. Following the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we believe that we hold a
market share of approximately 21.0% in terms of revenue in the Benelux light vehicle IAM. Our
addressable market has demonstrated resilience in recent years and currently benefits from
advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with significant purchasing power with
aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network throughout France, which we have
expanded with the ACR Acquisition in April 2014 and more recently, the Doyen Auto Acquisition
on September 30, 2016, allows us to deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 281 suppliers. We have also
distributed light vehicle parts across the Benelux IAM since the completion of the Doyen Auto
Acquisition.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France and Benelux is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy
aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors and online retailers. These
distributors sell these parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fastfitters, fleet garages for light vehicles and trucks, and car centers (“garages”), some of which are
affiliated with us and operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”).

Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to garages represented 75.7% of our revenue in France
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, and sales by us to affiliated independent

67


-----

distributors represented 24.2% of our revenue in France over the same period. As of August 31,
2016, we had a network of 33 wholly-owned distributors and 44 affiliated independent
distributors in France. These distributors operate out of 493 distribution sites, comprising 307
wholly-owned and 186 affiliated distribution sites, which are supplied either by our four
warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle collision repair parts and one for
truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use a customized IT system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44
distribution sites. In Benelux, we have operated three warehouses and 107 affiliated distribution
sites since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 70,000 regular
professional customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

Of the €846.1 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 52.6%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
16.4%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.2%; and
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.8%. The remaining €270.8 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2016, was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Key factors affecting our results of operations

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and
financial condition and liquidity during the eight months ended August 31, 2015 and 2016 and
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 or which we expect will significantly affect
(or continue to affect) our results of operations in the future.

**_Factors related to our industry_**

_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_

The following factors may affect the amount of light vehicle parts sold in France in any given
period:

  - Size of the car parc. The size of the car parc, which is the number of vehicles on the road,
impacts the size of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision
repair. The size of the car parc in the markets in which we operate is impacted by
population size (which has grown to a limited extent in France over the last five years),
consumer spending power, the use of public transportation (which has increased in recent
years) and the rate at which new cars are introduced and old cars are retired from the car
parc. The size of the car parc in France increased at a CAGR of 0.3% between 2010 and
2015.

  - Age of the car parc. The average age of the car parc in France increased from
approximately 7.7 years in 2005 to approximately 8.8 years in 2015, and this trend is
expected to continue. Vehicles aged ten to fourteen years increased as a percentage of the
total car parc, from approximately 20% in 2004 to approximately 23% in 2015, which

68


-----

typically benefits IAM. In general, older cars require more repair and maintenance services
and spare parts than younger cars, and as a result an increase in the age of the car parc can
have a positive impact on our operations. The age of the car parc is impacted by the sales
price and production quality of new light vehicles because both high sales prices and
increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles to run longer without
repair or replacement) generally lead vehicle owners to delay the purchase of new light
vehicles.

  - Postponement of certain light vehicle repairs. We believe that during an economic
downturn, some of our end-customers postpone light vehicle repairs and maintenance
inspections and repairs and maintenance due to their diminished spending power.
Although key maintenance inspections and repairs cannot be postponed for a prolonged
period, we believe that the IAM for light vehicles in France has in the past been affected
by this temporary postponement of repairs during recent economic downturns despite a
stable car parc size and the increasing age of light vehicles.

  - Miles travelled. Light vehicles that are frequently used and driven many miles typically
require more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than light
vehicles that drive fewer miles. We believe that, following a decrease in miles travelled per
light vehicle due to general economic conditions in Europe, particularly in France, the
annual mileage per car has begun to stabilize. Government incentives that encourage
carpooling and the use of public transportation also adversely impact miles travelled. The
fleet mileage for the Heavy Vehicles segment is expected to grow, mainly driven by the
recovery in Europe of the manufacturing sector and associated transportation needs.

  - Preference for independent garages over manufacturers’ dealers’ garages. We believe
that the diminished spending power of our consumers and the increasing age of the car
parc have encouraged some customers to rely more on garages operating in the
independent segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers’ segment. Certain
customers prefer, however, particularly during the warranty coverage period, to have their
light vehicle serviced in a manufacturer’s dealer’s garage, due to the link between the
manufacturers’ dealers’ garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer despite current
regulation that allows customers to use independent garages without impacting their
warranty. On average, the IAM provides more competitive pricing than the OES.
Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that
generally have higher prices than those offered by us.

  - Composition of the car parc. The number of brands and models of light vehicles in France
has been steadily increasing in recent years, which has resulted in an increase in the variety
of spare parts ultimately ordered by our customers. This increase in the variety of spare
parts benefits large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to stock a
wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop shop for our endcustomers, who increasingly require a wider range of products. We believe that this
increase in brands and models of light vehicles may adversely affect manufacturers’
dealers’ distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale IAM distributors, which
are less able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. We also believe that the increase in
brands and models of light vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM
distributors, thereby further benefiting established, large and integrated distributors such
as us.

The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results for the periods
under review, and we believe have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings
and cash flow.

_Technological trends in our industry_

Our results are impacted by the changing technological trends in our industry and our ability to
respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such
as the increased number of driver assistance systems, control devices and other electronic
components, have resulted in sophisticated and more-expensive repair processes and related
spare parts. The increased use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and
spare parts has also led to an extended lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such

69


-----

as exhaust systems, tires, brakes and motor oil. These trends have adversely affected our
operations in certain of our business segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to
wear out less frequently, which in turn extends maintenance service cycles and leads to lower
demand for spare parts and repair services.

Furthermore, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages need to acquire
the appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to the tools,
instruments and parts that such technological developments demand. Failure by independent
garages to do so may result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services
provided by manufacturers’ dealers’ garages with the necessary technical expertise. Similarly,
given the extended lifespan of spare parts, certain light vehicle manufacturers have extended
their new light vehicle warranties for eight years or more and provide long-term service
programs to customers. Notwithstanding, in many cases, decreasing volumes have been offset by
increased prices for technologically advanced spare parts and complex repair services. In addition,
certain technological advancements may require entire modules or systems to be replaced in
certain types of light vehicles, as opposed to discrete parts, thereby increasing replacement costs
and decreasing market shares for small garages.

_General economic conditions_

Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in
France as a whole have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business
lines responds differently to general economic conditions. Our light vehicles business line tends
to demonstrate resilience during weaker general economic conditions, as light vehicle owners
switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’ dealers’ garages, and the average
age of the car parc increases. This provides our business with an element of counter-cyclicality,
although we may initially experience slower sales due to destocking by distributors and garages
and vehicle owners delaying repairs. Our truck parts distribution business line shows a higher
correlation with general economic cycles, with miles driven by trucks, and therefore demand for
truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve. Our collision repair business
tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles. In addition, certain of our
products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to exhibit inelastic demand, even
during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary items, such as accessories for light
vehicles and trucks, tend to be impacted more by the economic climate.

_Regulation_

The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes,
including those that govern access to the spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors and those
that seek to impact vehicle safety and other driver behaviors.

_New BER_

In recent years, the market for the supply and distribution of spare parts has been generally
liberalized as a result of EU regulatory changes. This development has improved access to the
spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors. The light vehicle and truck wholesale sector in the
European Union is currently regulated by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”), which
was adopted in 2010 and replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) A key aim of
the New BER is to ensure fair competition in the light vehicle and truck wholesale sector. In
general, we believe that the current regulatory framework is favorable to our operations and
ensures (i) full access for independent spare parts manufacturers and garages to the technical
information needed to ensure effective competition within and between the IAM and the OES,
(ii) customers’ rights to engage independent garages throughout the life of the light vehicle with
no warranty limitations, (iii) the unrestricted sale of spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’
rights to use private brands and logos for spare parts sales.

_Traffic laws and policy_

The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a decline in collisions as a
result of the increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws. We have, however,

increased our market share in this declining market by strengthening our relationships with car
insurance companies, providing collision parts at lower prices and improving our supply chain for
the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision repair.

_CICE_

In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments
for certain social charges, such as CICE.

In December 2012, CICE, a new tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs, was adopted
as part of an overall stated French government policy to improve the competitive position of
companies in France. Pursuant to CICE rules, French companies receive a tax credit of 4% of the
gross salaries paid to employees whose gross salary is less than or equal to 2.5 times the French
statutory minimum wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance) for 2013 and 6% of
the gross salaries of such employees for 2014 and subsequent years (noting that such rate could
be increased to 7% for salaries paid from January 1, according to the draft finance bill for 2017
released by the French government). The amount of CICE is calculated on the basis of gross
salaries paid to employees. Under normal circumstances, CICE can be offset against corporation
tax due with respect to the year during which the relevant salaries have been paid. If the amount
of the corporation tax charge is less than the amount of CICE, the balance can be carried forward
for the next three fiscal years and thus be offset against corporation tax charges with respect to
such next three fiscal years. If after these three fiscal years, the amount of CICE has not been fully
utilized, the remaining amount can be refunded by the French tax authorities if requested. We
have assigned a portion of our CICE claim for the years 2013 and 2014 under a factoring
agreement in order to immediately achieve cash flow benefits.

In light of ongoing state budgetary pressures in France, the French government may decide at
any time to change its policy and limit the application of CICE (for example, by changing the
basis upon which CICE is calculated) or eliminate it altogether. There can be no assurance
therefore that we will continue to be able to benefit from CICE.

**_Factors specific to our business_**

_Acquisitions and disposals_

External growth through acquisitions has contributed to the overall growth of our business. We
acquired a truck spare parts distributor in 2013. In December 2013 we acquired Rougon Queyrel,
a distributor of spare parts for light vehicles in southeastern France; in April 2014, we acquired
ACR, a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light vehicles; and on September 30,
2016, we acquired Doyen Auto with the proceeds from the Bridge Facility, which we intend to
repay in full with the proceeds from this Offering. These acquisitions have impacted and will
continue to impact our results, and limit the comparability of our results from period to period.
We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to further expand our network in order
to increase our market share. By further participating in the industry-wide consolidation of the
market and integrating acquired entities into our Group, we believe that we can increase our
purchasing power with suppliers, thereby generating better margins.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue of €196.0 million
and Adjusted EBITDA of €8.9 million. Doyen Auto’s operating results will be consolidated with
ours going forward. As a result, our financial results in the future will not be directly comparable
to those in this Offering Memorandum.

We will account for the acquisition of Doyen Auto using the acquisition method of accounting.
As a result, the purchase price for Doyen Auto will be allocated to the tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of
the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over these allocations will be assigned to
goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment
at least annually. The allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired in the acquisition
will be determined by external experts. This determination of fair values could result in an
increase in our amortization expense. This relates to our acquired intangible assets because we
adjust the book value of the acquired intangible assets to fair value. Under applicable accounting
guidance, we are permitted to continue to make fair value adjustments until twelve months after

the acquisition date. We will evaluate the remaining depreciable lives of the assets to reflect the
estimated useful lives for purposes of calculating periodic depreciation, and we will continue to
amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We will also continue to review
the value of the inventory and may make further adjustments to the fair value, which may
change the costs and expenses recognized by us upon the sale of this acquired inventory.

_Operational improvement measures_

Our results are impacted by operational improvement measures that we implement. Since 2009,
we have developed and continue to implement operating strategies designed to increase
revenues, reduce costs and capital expenditures, and improve margins. Specifically, we have:

  - Installed a new management team. In 2009, we introduced a new, experienced
management team who have been implementing our strategic vision and driving
profitability over the last five years.

  - Implemented a profit improvement plan. We implemented a profit improvement plan
between 2009 and 2015 to reduce the cost of management and administration at our
subsidiaries by implementing shared services, limiting employee costs in our local
businesses, and minimizing transportation and logistics costs by optimizing truck routes
and making greater use of central distribution facilities. We also sought to improve
productivity by eliminating certain loss-making businesses. The plan was also focused on
improving the way our central purchasing departments make purchases, in addition to
refining our enterprise resource system (“ERP”) to allow us to analyze rebates across our
business. As part of such improvements, we segmented purchases among different product
groups, gradually concentrated purchases of core mechanical repair parts among selected
suppliers and used our Group-wide purchasing power to negotiate improved rebates for
purchases of fast-moving spare parts and spare parts with a dominant supplier.

  - Revised margins applied to distributors. Prior to 2009, we charged different margins to
wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors. We have since moved
to a uniform margin for wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.
We have also implemented a loyalty program with both our wholly-owned and our
affiliated independent distributors to encourage them to purchase spare parts and
equipment and tools from our central purchasing departments. As members of our loyalty
program, all our distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by typically
agreeing to purchase at least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.

We believe that one of our most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use
the purchasing power derived from our large size and specialized warehouse and logistics
systems. Through our logistics process, we have been able to obtain more favorable supply terms
from suppliers than those available to many other participants in the light vehicle and truck
aftermarket. We also sought to reduce the number of suppliers we use, and thus we have
concentrated larger volumes of purchases among fewer suppliers, resulting in improved
purchasing terms and conditions for product groups that we distribute. In order to preserve our
flexibility in obtaining favorable prices in the market, we do not generally enter into long-term
supply contracts. We believe this purchasing policy has generally resulted in lower costs. We
expect Doyen Auto to benefit from this as well through purchasing and cost savings. See
“Summary—Recent developments—Doyen Auto Acquisition.”

Since the beginning of 2014, we have implemented a new five-year business plan, which we
review and adjust annually. As part of this business plan, we have developed our business-tobusiness sales of spare parts for light vehicles by increasing the efficiency of our logistics
platforms and our supply model, and by improving our customer service with more efficient call
centers. We also intend to further develop over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts
through over-the-counter loyalty programs, specific marketing efforts and dedicated sales force
training. We intend to further develop our truck business by implementing a new sales strategy,
including redefining our product assortment to better suit local market expectations, launching
new sales tools (such as the eBook sales IT system) and increasing our interaction with our main
customers through a product offering tailored to such customers.

72

In addition, the law dated March 17, 2014 (the “Hamon Law”) added an additional provision to
Article L. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the case of a monthly
invoice, the payment period may not exceed forty-five (45) days from the date of the invoice. We
were able to fully adapt our working capital cycle to such revised payments terms and to pass on
some further changes in such payment terms to our customers.

_Competition_

We compete against online light vehicle spare parts retailers that mainly compete with us on the
basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet
before making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. We
realized at an early stage that the internet offered innovative opportunities for light vehicle and
truck spare parts distributors. As a result, we created the Autossimo online light vehicle repair
and maintenance portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online truck repair and maintenance portal
in 2001 in order to address the demand for ordering spare parts online. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2016, approximately €138.7 million of our revenue from sales of light vehicle
spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors was
generated from the sale of light vehicle spare parts through our online portal, Autossimo.

In addition, we also compete with manufacturers’ dealers’ garages such as Peugeot and Renault.
Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages typically specialize in light vehicles from newly purchased to
three-year-old vehicles, and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by
warranties, as well as a more limited share of repairs of light vehicles and trucks aged four years
and older. Certain vehicle manufacturers have, however, extended their new light vehicles
warranties to up to eight years and cover longer-term maintenance and repairs.

### Explanation of key income statement line items

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line
items of our income statement.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is primarily generated through the sale of products and, to a lesser extent, services to
our customers. We recognize revenue from the sale of products when we deliver goods to the
customer. We recognize revenue from services in the period in which services are rendered. We
deduct customer rebates and bonuses and other taxes on sales.

**_Cost of goods for sale_**

Cost of goods for sale includes purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories and
net allocation to inventories depreciation.

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages, social security contributions, profit-sharing plans and pension
costs.

**_Other purchases and external expenses_**

Other purchases and external expenses relate to non-direct operating costs, including rental
expenses, shipping expenses, maintenance and repair costs, legal and other fees, IT expenses,
advertising expenses, subcontracting costs, travelling and other expenses.

**_Taxes_**

Taxes include taxes on salaries (mainly taxes in respect of vocational training), social construction
tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises), social solidarity contribution (contribution sociale de
_solidarité—a tax calculated based on a percentage of net sales), and other taxes other than_
income taxes.

73


-----

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax, financial
items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from operations and
depreciation/amortization expense.

**_Depreciation/amortization expenses_**

Depreciation/amortization expenses represent the depreciation of property, plant, equipment
and intangible assets (excluding goodwill and our brands, such as AD), which are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant, equipment and intangible assets are tested for
impairment when there are indications of impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in
other expenses from operations when the recoverable amount of an intangible asset is lower
than its carry value.

**_Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations generally relate to one-off events or other events
outside our ordinary business. Other income and expenses from operations can include gains and
losses on the disposal of operations, of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, as
well as costs relating to provisions and expenses relating to restructuring, employee and tax
disputes, and impairment losses/reversals.

**_Financial income and expenses_**

Financial income includes income from financial investments, foreign exchange gains and other
financial income. Financial expenses include interest on external loans and bank overdrafts
payable by the Group, discounting of borrowings and debt, expenses related to financial
instruments and to finance leases, foreign exchange losses and other financial expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes consist of current tax expense, CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des
_Entreprises) and changes in deferred tax assets._

### Description of other key financial indicators

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain items that we consider to be
nonrecurring or exceptional in nature, or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of
our business. See the table set forth in “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other
_information” for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from_
continuing operations for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, and the years
ended December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.

### Restatements

Since January 1, 2015, we have applied the interpretation IFRIC 21 which clarifies that the
obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant
legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. Since these amendments were applied
retroactively, our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, which are
included in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2015, for comparison purposes have been restated to reflect the application of IFRIC 21. See
note 3.2 of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €7.6 million, or 0.9%, from €806.2 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015, to €813.8 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. In France,
revenue increased by €7.8 million, or 1.1%, from €731.2 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015, to €739.0 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by €6.7 million, or 1.2%, from
€562.7 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €556.1 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the disposal of a former

wholly-owned distributor of spare parts for light vehicles (APS Berwald) to an affiliated
independent distributor on January 1, 2016, with a negative impact of approximately €12.7
million on our revenue for the eight months ended August 31, 2016, compared to the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, as well as to the disposals of various distributors of spare parts
for light vehicles and trucks during the eight months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, with a
negative impact of approximately €7.2 million on our revenue for the eight months ended
August 31, 2016. This decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of Automax by ACR on
February 3, 2016, which contributed €5.3 million to our revenue for the eight months ended
August 31, 2016, and the acquisition of a multi-brand light vehicle spare parts distributor
(Manche Calvados) in February 2015, which contributed €1.8 million to our revenue for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals, revenue from
sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by approximately €6.0 million due to increased
sales by certain distributors of spare parts for light vehicles.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors increased by €14.4 million, or 8.6%,
from €168.4 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €182.9 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to organic growth and the
transfer of revenue from a former wholly-owned distributor (APS Berwald) to an affiliated
independent distributor for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

In Poland, revenue remained stable from €75.0 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015, to €74.9 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016, despite unfavorable
exchange rate changes that negatively affected our revenue by €3.8 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2016. This negative effect was offset by an increase in sales volumes.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €1.9 million, or 0.4%, from €494.8 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, to €496.7 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

Cost of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 61.4% for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015, to 61.0% for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. This decrease was
primarily due to an increase in supplier rebates as percentage of revenue from 12.1% for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to 13.3% for the eight months ended August 31, 2016,
mainly due to better purchasing conditions and purchasing savings obtained as a result of higher
sales volumes following the integration of Automax.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs decreased by €4.4 million, or 2.7%, from €164.0 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015, to €159.6 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016, in line
with our headcount reductions, from 6,136 employees for the eight months ended August 31,
2015, to 5,995 for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to
the disposal of a former wholly-owned distributor (APS Berwald) to an affiliated independent
distributor, as well as continued operating costs improvement. Personnel costs as a percentage of
revenue decreased from 20.3% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to 19.6% for the
eight months ended August 31, 2016, primarily due to better cost controls.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €3.9 million, or 4.4%, from €88.6 million for
the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €92.5 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 11.0% for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to 11.4% for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. This
increase was primarily due to increased investments in advertising with our first national
television advertisements, partially offset by lower rental expenses following the disposals of
businesses, mainly APS Berwald, and the lower fixed costs in a context of sales growth excluding
the impact of acquisitions and disposals.

_Taxes_

Taxes remained stable from €6.7 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €6.5
million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. For the eight months ended August 31,
2016, taxes mainly comprised a French vocational training tax of €1.4 million (compared to €1.5
million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015), a social construction tax of €1.6 million
(compared to €1.4 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015), a social solidarity
contribution of €1.7 million (compared to €1.9 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015) and taxes other than income taxes of €1.9 million (compared to €1.9 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015).

_Depreciation/ amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense remained stable with €12.2 million for the eight months
ended, August 31, 2015, compared to €12.1 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €4.2 million, or 200.0%, from €2.1 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €6.3 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016. This increase was primarily due to gains made on the disposal of certain of the APS Berwald
businesses and the disposal of three distribution sites.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €1.1 million, or 19.3%, from €5.7 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €6.8 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016. This increase was primarily due to a goodwill impairment of €2.1 million of the truck
vehicle segment as a result of the negative performance of our truck parts for maintenance and
repairs product line, and the higher net book value on fixed asset disposals of €1.7 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2016, compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015. This
increase was partially offset by a decrease of restructuring charges of €1.8 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016, compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income increased by €0.2 million, or 50.0%, from income of €0.4 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €0.6 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016. This increase was primarily due to the disposal of our shares held in Neoparts on August 1,
2016, which resulted in a gain of €0.3 million.

Financial expenses decreased by €2.5 million, or 14.4%, from €17.4 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015, to €14.9 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. This
decrease was primarily due to an adjustment of €3.5 million in the fair value of the Contingent
Value Instruments for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, which were partly redeemed in
December 2015. The cost of external loans and bank overdrafts, mostly relating to interest
payable on the Existing Senior Secured Notes, slightly increased by €0.3 million, as a result of the
issuance of additional Existing Senior Secured Notes in May 2015, from €11.8 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, to €12.1 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

_Income tax_

Income tax increased by €3.1 million, from a €2.2 million income tax expense for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to a €0.8 million income tax credit for the eight months
ended August 31, 2016. For the eight months ended August 31, 2016, income tax comprised
CVAE of €3.9 million (compared to €4.4 million in 2015), current income tax expense of
€0.4 million (compared to €1.5 million in 2015) and a deferred tax credit of €2.6 million
(compared to a deferred tax credit of €8.1 million in 2015), due to the use of deferred tax credit
for the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €8.1 million, or 14.3%, from €56.5 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015, to €64.6 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 7.0% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015, to 7.9% for
the eight months ended August 31, 2016.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €7.9 million, or 14.3%, from €55.3 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €63.2 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 7.6% for the eight months ended August 30, 2015,
to 8.6% for the eight months ended August 31, 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin
was primarily due to the higher purchasing power of our central purchasing departments and the
lower level of fixed operating costs (mainly personnel expenses and rents), as well as
management initiatives on cost efficiencies.

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €0.1 million, or 7.7%, from €1.3 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015, to €1.4 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 1.7% for the eight months ended August 30, 2015,
to 1.9% for the eight months ended August 30, 2016. This was primarily due to to lower
operating costs, partly offset by an unfavorable exchange rate variance.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €52.6 million, or 4.5%, from €1,169.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €1,222.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In France, revenue
increased by €52.4 million, or 5.0%, from €1,056.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014,
to €1,109.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €36.9 million, or 4.5%, from
€815.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €852.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the full-year impact of our acquisition
(including year-on-year organic growth) of ACR on April 7, 2014, which contributed €24.8 million
of additional revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2014, and our acquisition of businesses (Manche Calvados) in February 2015, which
contributed €8.1 million of additional revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. This
increase was partly offset by the full-year impact of the disposal of a former wholly-owned
distributor (SOFAR) in September 2014, which contributed €7.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014. Excluding the effect of these acquisitions and disposals, revenue from sales
by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €11.2 million, reflecting the strong performance
of the light vehicle segment.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors increased by €15.3 million, or
6.3%, from €241.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €256.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015. This increase was mainly due to the disposal of a former whollyowned distributor (SOFAR) to an affiliated independent distributor and the increasing
contribution of the heavy vehicle platform Bremstar and the light vehicle parts for collision repair
platform Cora.

In Poland, revenue remained stable with €112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to €113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to our low-price strategy
which has contributed to an increase in sales volume despite a more competitive market.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €29.6 million, or 4.1%, from €721.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €750.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Cost of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 61.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to 61.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, mainly resulting from the
better purchasing conditions and full-year purchasing synergies provided by the integration of
ACR in April 2014, higher sales volumes and active cost renegotiation efforts.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €4.1 million, or 1.6%, from €245.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €249.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Personnel costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from 20.9% for the year ended December
31, 2014, to 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, in line with our overall headcount
reductions from 6,315 employees for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 6,145 for the year
ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in the personnel costs as a percentage of revenue was
primarily due to the disposal of a wholly-owned distributor to an independent distributor, as
well as continued operating costs improvement, partly offset by the increase in the cost of a
temporary workforce of €1.9 million, or 18.9%.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €1.1 million, or 0.8%, from €133.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2014, to 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease
was primarily due to lower rental expenses following renegotiation of existant leases and
rationalization of the size of our distribution buildings and a lower level of fixed costs. This
decrease was partly offset by advertising investments in order to strengthen the identity and
reputation of the AD brand and its network.

_Taxes_

Taxes decreased by €0.2 million, or 2.2%, from €9.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2014, to €8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In 2015, taxes mainly comprised a
French vocational training tax of €2.2 million (compared to €2.3 million in 2014), a social
construction tax of €2.0 million (compared to €2.0 million in 2014), a social solidarity contribution
of €2.0 million (compared to €2.0 million in 2014) and taxes other than income taxes of €2.8
million (compared to €3.0 million in 2014).

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense slightly increased by €0.3 million, or 1.6%, from €18.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2014, to €18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations decreased by €10.7 million, or 88.4%, from €12.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2014, to €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This
decrease was primarily due to the valuation of the “AD” brand that we carried out in 2015,
which showed a stability in brand value as a result of which no reversal of impairment of the
“AD” brand was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a reversal of
impairment of the “AD” brand of €9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations decreased by €12.6 million, or 67.0%, from €18.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2014, to €6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This
decrease was primarily due to the valuation of the truck Cash-Generating Unit’s (“CGU”) assets
that we carried out as of December 31, 2015, which showed no decrease in value as a result of
which no goodwill impairment of the truck CGU and no impairment losses on the property, plant
and equipment were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a goodwill
impairment of the truck CGU of €5.8 million in addition to a €3.0 million impairment of certain
non-current assets in the truck CGU for the year ended December 31, 2014. See “—Critical
_accounting policies— Impairment of non-financial assets.”_

81


-----

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income decreased by €9.7 million, or 83.6%, from €11.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was due
to a €0.9 million change in fair value of our Contingent Value Instruments for the year ended
December 31, 2015 (compared to an adjustment of €11.1 million in the fair value of our
Contingent Value Instruments for the year ended December 31, 2014).

Financial expenses increased by €7.4 million, or 34.3%, from €21.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due
to an adjustment of €6.8 million in the fair value of our Contingent Value Instruments for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €3.9 million from a €1.8 million income tax credit for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to a €5.7 million income tax credit for the year ended December 31, 2015.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax comprised CVAE of €5.5 million (compared to
€5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014), current income tax expense of €4.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a deferred tax credit of €16.1 million (compared to a
deferred tax credit of €9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014). This €7.1 million
variation in deferred taxes was mainly due to the use of deferred tax credit in the year ended
December 31, 2015.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €16.2 million, or 23.3%, from €69.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014, to €85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 7.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €16.3 million, or 24.1%, from €67.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014, to €83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 7.6% for the year
ended December 31, 2015. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partly due to profit
improvement in all business segments, notably light vehicles spare parts, as well as the impact of
the ACR Acquisition on April 7, 2014, which contributed directly and indirectly (through
progressive synergies ramp-up) approximately €6.3 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA for the
year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and generated
cost efficiencies.

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €0.1 million, or 5.6%, from €1.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014 to €1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted
EBITDA margin decreased from 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 1.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2015 due to a lower end-pricing strategy which has allowed us to maintain
a constant sales volume in a competitive market albeit with a slightly lower margin, partly offset
by staff costs and rental expenses reductions.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €32.3 million, or 2.8%, from €1,137.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2013, to €1,169.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In France, revenue increased
by €33.3 million, or 3.3%, from €1,023.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, to
€1,056.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €45.5 million, or 5.9%, from
€770.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €815.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the ACR Acquisition, which contributed

83


-----

€47.6 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the acquisition of
Rougon-Queyrel on December 30, 2013, which contributed €14.3 million to our revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was partly offset by the disposal in September 2014
of Sofar, which contributed €7.2 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to €9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the effect of these
acquisitions and disposals, revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by
€14.5 million, or 1.9%, on a like-for-like basis, primarily due to difficult economic conditions
which impacted our truck parts for maintenance and repair product line.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors decreased by €12.1 million, or
4.8%, from €253.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €241.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of Rougon-Queyrel,
previously one of our affiliated independent distributors which became one of our wholly-owned
distributors.

In Poland, revenue remained stable with €113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
compared to €112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, despite difficult market
conditions resulting in lower sales volumes.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €10.5 million, or 1.5%, from €710.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €721.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Cost of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 62.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily
due to higher rebates from our suppliers following the integration of ACR.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €6.4 million, or 2.7%, from €239.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to increased wages and social contributions following the ACR Acquisition. This
increase was partially offset by overall headcount reductions from 6,321 employees for the year
ended December 31, 2013 to 6,315 for the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding ACR, and by
a positive impact of €2.5 million relating to CICE for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to CICE for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in CICE tax credit
from 4% to 6%.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €6.9 million, or 5.5%, from €126.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €133.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in our transportation costs as a result of the ACR
Acquisition.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 11.1% for the
year ended December 31, 2013, to 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase
was primarily due to additional commercial costs related to a major customer and network event.

_Taxes_

Taxes decreased by €0.4 million, or 4.1%, from €9.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, to €9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31,
2014, taxes mainly comprised a French vocational training tax of €2.3 million (compared to €2.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2013), a social construction tax of €2.0 million
(compared to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013), a social solidarity contribution
of €2.0 million (compared to €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013) and taxes other
than income taxes of €3.1 million (compared to €3.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2013).

-----

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense increased by €2.0 million, or 12.3%, from €16.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2013, to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily due to a higher level of software and licenses depreciation and the
depreciation of the acquired customer database of ACR.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €4.7 million, or 63.5%, from €7.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to €12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase
was primarily due to a reversal of impairment of €9.0 million on our AD brand for the year ended
December 31, 2014, following a decrease in the discount rate applied in the yearly valuation of
our brand, from 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 10.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €7.8 million, or 70.9%, from €11.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2013, to €18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily due to the negative impact of difficult economic conditions on the assets
of our truck parts for maintenance and repairs product line, resulting in a goodwill impairment
of €5.8 million and an impairment charge of €3.0 million on property, plant and equipment.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income increased by €0.6 million, or 5.5%, from €11.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due
to an adjustment in the fair value of our Contingent Value Instruments following our improved
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Financial expenses increased by €12.6 million, or 140%, from €9.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in the payment of interest from €4.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, mainly due to the
payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €19.4 million, from a €17.6 million income tax expense for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to a €1.8 million income tax credit for the year ended December 31,
2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax comprised CVAE of €5.4 million
(compared to €5.3 million in for the year ended December 31, 2013), current income tax expense
(which remained stable) at €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and a deferred
tax credit of €9.0 million (compared to a deferred tax expense of €10.5 million in for the year
ended December 31, 2013). This €19.5 million increase in deferred tax was mainly due to
additional deferred tax assets recognized on tax losses carryforward.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €14.0 million, or 25.3%, from €55.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013, to 5.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €14.0 million, or 26.0%, from €53.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to €67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013, to 6.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly due to synergies from the integration of ACR
and tight cost controls in our light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair and light vehicle
parts for collision repair product lines (our EBITDA margin increased from 3.0% for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014).

85


-----

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA remained stable at €1.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2014. Despite lower sales volumes, Adjusted EBITDA margin remained stable at approximately
1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower staff costs and lower rents for our sites
in Poland. On a pro forma basis to give effect to the ACR Acquisition as if such acquisition would
have occurred on January 1, 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014
would have been approximately €74.3 million.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital
expenditures, operating losses, acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our
principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated
from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities and finance leases.

We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents,
cash generated from operations, any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft
facilities, including our Revolving Credit Facility, factoring facilities and finance leases.

Our financial condition and liquidity has been, and are expected to continue to be, influenced by
a variety of factors, including:

  - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

  - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on
such indebtedness, which affect our finance costs;

  - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements;

  - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks;

   - our level of acquisition activity; and

  - our capital expenditure requirements.

Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following:

  - paying operating costs and working capital;

  - funding capital expenditures;

  - servicing indebtedness; and

  - paying taxes.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be adequate
to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we cannot assure
you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these needs or
that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us
to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt when due. If
our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital expenditure
requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional financing, which
may not available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing
generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including general economic
conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions, capital markets,
restrictions in instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to generate_
_sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and may_
_be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not_
_be successful.”_

_Cash flows from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities is mainly impacted by changes in working capital and other
items with a cash effect, in addition to changes in net income and cancellations of unrealized
income and expenses, the elimination of financial expenses and income with a cash effect, and
the elimination of income tax.

87


-----

The monthly variations of the net cash flows from operating activities are largely impacted by
the seasonality of our business. In particular, our working capital is typically high (resulting from
higher inventories and receivables) in July and October, which explains the much lower level of
net cash flow from operating activities during these months.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €40.1 million (or 4.9% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €12.1 million), which was
partly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital due to higher levels of inventory, as a
result of an increase in activity, seasonality effects and the strategy of build-up of inventory in
Poland to ensure products’ availability for customers, as well as the timing of the payments of
other payables, such as tax and employee benefits.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €17.2 million (or 2.1% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €12.2 million) offset by
an unfavorable change in working capital, mainly due to higher levels of inventory and trade
receivables due to an increase in activity and seasonality effects.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €31.5 million (or 2.6% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to improvement of net income after adjustments for
non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €18.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015), which was partly offset by an unfavorable change in working capital as a
result of a higher level of receivables and payables (mainly trade receivables of €12.9 million) and
an amount of CICE receivables of €7.2 million.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €38.7 million (or 3.3% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after adjustments
for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €18.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014) partly offset by an unfavorable change in working capital as a result of a
lower level of CICE receivables, excluding the impact of the ACR Acquisition.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €30.5 million (or 2.7% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after adjustments
for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €16.3 million), which was partly offset
by an unfavorable change in working capital due to higher receivables as a result of an increase
in sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2013.

_Working capital_

Working capital comprises trade working capital and other receivables and payables. Our trade
working capital comprises inventories, trade payables and trade receivables. Other receivables
and payables primarily comprise tax and employee benefit payables.

Our inventory levels are affected by the seasonality of our activity, our product range strategy
and our ability to manage our stocks locally. The change in trade payables and receivables is
mainly linked to the seasonality of our business. The level of receivables may also be impacted by
our ability to recover payments from our customers.

Our working capital requirements are affected by the seasonality of our business. Our typical
working capital cycle is primarily driven by the build-up of inventory during the first semester,
with our working capital reaching its peak in July and October, and a decrease of our inventory
in the second semester, with our working capital reaching its trough in November.

For the eight months ended August 31, 2016, we generated an increase in working capital of
€11.5 million, primarily due to (i) an increase of €10.4 million in inventories, which was mainly
due to an increase in activity, the seasonal build-up of inventories in August, the increase in
painting stock resulting from the opening of a dedicated painting platform, offering new
storage capacity and the strategy of build-up of inventory in Poland to ensure products’
availability for customers; (ii) an outflow of €20.5 million in net other receivables and payables
mainly due to an increase in personnel expenses payables, as well as the increase in taxes payable
(mainly VAT and CICE) due to the timing of such payments, and (iii) a cash inflow of €19.4 million
of the net trade receivables and trade payables, as a result of higher level of payables explained
by higher purchases due to the seasonality of our business.

88


-----

We generated an increase in working capital of €28.4 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase of €10.8 million in inventories resulting from an
increase in activity and the seasonal build-up of inventories in August, (ii) an outflow of
€17.1 million in net other receivables and payables mainly due to a seasonal low point of
personal expenses payables in August and the build-up of the CICE receivables and (iii) a cash
outflow of €0.5 million of the net trade receivables and trade payables (mainly of ACR).
Excluding the impact of ACR, there was a cash inflow of €2.8 million mainly as a result of the
seasonal increase in both suppliers’ rebates (€14.5 million) and customers’ rebates (€10.5 million),
which usually occurs at this time of the year. Net working capital was also significantly affected
by the implementation of the Hamon Law. See “—Key factors affecting our results of
_operations—Factors specific to our business—Operational improvement measures.”_

We experienced an increase in working capital of €34.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2015, which primarily reflected (i) an increase of €6.6 million in inventories, due to lower net
provisions on inventories resulting from an increase in activity, (ii) an outflow of €5.9 million in
net other receivables and payables mainly due to the build-up of CICE receivables, (iii) a decrease
of €8.9 million in trade payables, mainly due to suppliers’ payment terms reduction and (iv) an
increase of €12.9 million in trade receivables, as well as a stabilized level of rebates.

We experienced an increase in working capital of €9.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2014, which primarily reflected a decrease of €9.7 million in trade payables, an increase of
€5.2 million in other receivables and payables, and an increase of €4.2 million in inventories
partly offset by the decrease of €9.0 million in trade receivables. The difference between the
balance sheet and the cash flow statement variations in working capital is mainly due to the ACR
Acquisition. Excluding the impact of ACR, this cash outflow is mainly due to the build-up of CICE
receivables.

We experienced an increase in working capital of €7.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, primarily due to an increase of €8.0 million in trade receivables following the increase in
sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

_Other items_

Other items with a cash impact related solely to the income tax paid of €5.0 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €3.9 million. Other items with a
cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of €3.3 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €4.3 million. Other items with a cash effect
related solely to the income tax paid of €7.0 million for the year ended December 31 2015,
mostly as a result of the CVAE of €5.5 million. Other items with a cash effect related solely to the
income tax paid of €7.2 million for the year ended December 31 2014, mostly as a result of the
CVAE of €5.4 million. Other items with a cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of
€7.3 million for the year ended December 31 2013, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €5.3 million
and an overestimation of income tax prepayments.

_Capital expenditures_

Capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition of fixed assets. Our capital expenditures
include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations.
In particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving
and machinery for the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases
of light vehicles and trucks. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the
capitalization of new functional development costs of our ERP, the purchase of software licenses
relating to management and financial reporting, technical light vehicle and truck databases, and
inventory management.

We have a “capex light” business model, and consequently are not required to make significant
capital investments in our business. Our capital expenditures were, on average, 1.8% of our
revenue and 31.3% of our Adjusted EBITDA in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and
2015.

We expect an increase in our investment in capital expenditures for the years ending
December 31, 2016, mainly due to the automation of our logistics platform. We do not anticipate
any other significant capital expenditure investments in the year ending December 31, 2016.

Capital expenditures increased by €7.9 million, to €24.7 million (or 3.0% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016, from €16.8 million (or 2.1% of revenue) for the eight months
ended August 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to investments in our new logistic
automation platform in Réau, which we expect to be operational by the middle of 2017. This
new logistics platform will cover a surface of 32,000 square meters and is intended to replace one
of our logistics sites. This increase was partially offset by the disposal of APS Berwald (ten sites in
Moselle) to an affiliated independent distributor in January 2016.

Capital expenditures increased by €8.0 million, to €26.7 million (or 2.2% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2015, from €18.7 million (or 1.6% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly due to the acquisition of four distribution sites,
which amounted to €1.7 million, a light vehicle warehouse, which amounted to €2.4 million, and
the construction of our new automated logistics platform in Réau in 2015, which amounted to
€3.7 million.

Capital expenditures decreased by €1.1 million, to €18.7 million (or 1.6% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2014, from €19.8 million (or 1.7% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2013. This decrease was mainly due to decreased investments in the year ended
December 31, 2014.

_Business acquisitions and advances paid_

Business acquisitions and advances paid mainly relate to external acquisitions, and advances paid
in relation to those acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net of cash (or
overdraft) held by such acquired entity.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €3.6 million (0.4% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2016. During the eight months ended August 31, 2016, the Group
acquired three participations in companies: (i) in February 2016 the Group purchased, net of cash,
a majority 70% interest in Automax Marseille for €1.7 million, which will be combined with ACR
to create a leading platform for automotive parts in Marseille; (ii) in March 2016 the Group
purchased a 34% participation in Société Lyonnaise de Pneumatiques et accessoires (SLPA), which
amounted to €1.4 million; and (iii) in June 2016 the Group purchased 100% of Electro Diesel
Service (EDS), specialized in commercial and utility vehicles repair and maintenance, for an
amount of €0.7 million (subject to post-closing price adjustments), net of cash transferred. During
the same period, we disposed of our 20% minority shareholding in Neoparts for €0.3 million (net
of cash).

Business acquisitions and advances paid decreased by €52.5 million, to zero for the year ended
December 31, 2015, from €52.5 million (or 4.5% of revenue) for the year ended December 31,
2014, as we did not acquire or dispose of any business during the year 2015.

Business acquisitions and advances paid increased by €39.4 million, to €52.5 million (or 4.5% of
revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2014, from €13.1 million (or 1.2% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2013. These business acquisitions and advances paid primarily include
the acquisition of ACR.

(€7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014), reflecting the two semi-annual coupon
payments in February and August 2015 compared to one payment made in August 2014, as well
as the issuance of an additional €60.0 million of Existing Senior Secured Notes in May 2015; (ii) an
increase in borrowings of €70.2 million primarily relating to the €62.0 million of additional

**_Credit arrangements following this Offering_**

_Notes offered hereby_

Following this Offering, we expect to have €510.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes
outstanding. We will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in cash at the annual interest rate
and on the dates set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. Interest will accrue
from the Issue Date.

The Indenture will contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of
our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on or make
distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments;
enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise
dispose of assets, including the capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; enter into transactions with
affiliates; create or incur liens; and merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets. These
covenants will be subject to important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants.”_

_Revolving Credit Facility_

We entered into a Revolving Credit Facility on November 12, 2015, with the guarantors named
therein as original guarantors or borrowers, the financial institutions named therein as original
lenders and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as security agent. In connection with the Doyen Auto
Acquisition, we sought an increase of the Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €10.0 million,
as a result of which the Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of
€50.0 million on a committed basis. The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving
Credit Facility will be the aggregate of the applicable margin and LIBOR/EURIBOR (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and subject to a floor of zero). The margin may range
from 2.50% to 3.50% based on a consolidated senior secured leverage ratchet and subject to
certain conditions. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement.”_

_Factoring arrangements and working capital and bilateral lending facilities_

The foregoing table does not include liabilities associated with pension entitlements. As of
August 31, 2016, we had a €24.4 million provision for post-employment defined benefit plan
liabilities.

### Credit management policy

We have adopted credit management procedures adjusted to the characteristics of the market
and of our customers in order to reduce the risk of exposure and to attempt to allow prompt and
proactive management of our business. The proactive customer credit risk monitoring activities
start by grouping consumers based on their type, the duration of credit, the existence of previous
financial difficulties or notifications and of the possible existence of legal or ongoing bankruptcy
procedures. Financial assets are recorded in the financial statements net of the write-off based
on the risk of breach by the counterparty, which is determined based on the available
information regarding the customer’s solvency.

### Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about financial risk

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. We monitor
and manage these risks as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which
recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potential adverse
effects on our results of operations.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The euro is the functional currency in which our financial statements are presented. Our
subsidiary in Poland generates currency in Polish złoty, and for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2016, Polish złoty represented 9.2% of our revenue. We do not hedge this exchange
rate risk.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risks due to our need to finance our operations as well as to
utilize our available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a negative or a
positive impact on our financial results by indirectly influencing the repayment of loans and
investments. Following the Offering, our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be
primarily composed of the Fixed Rate Notes (which have a fixed interest rate) and the Floating
Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (which borrowings will have an interest rate based
on EURIBOR or LIBOR, reset periodically). We do not currently intend to hedge the interest rate
payments on our Floating Rate Notes to be issued on the Issue Date. We may, however, decide to
do so in the future.

93


-----

We evaluate our exposure to changes in interest rates on a regular basis and may decide to
manage the foregoing risks through financial derivatives, according to the directives contained in
the “Interest rate risk management policy” we have adopted. Notwithstanding our potential use
of hedging instruments, unexpected changes in interest rates could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

### Off-balance sheet arrangements

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. For a description of certain
commitments and guarantees that we have given to third parties in connection with our
financing arrangements and other ordinary course rental and other obligations, see note 27 to
the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of
and for the eight months ended August 31, 2016, and note 30 to the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

### Other financial obligations: pension obligations

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see note 21 to our unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the eight months ended August 31,
2016, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

### Critical accounting policies

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various
estimates and assumptions that affect the results we report. Such estimates or assumptions are
based on our historical experience and currently available information, including expectations of
future events that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
significantly from such estimates in light of the uncertainty surrounding the assumptions and
conditions upon which the estimates are based. The following are significant accounting policies
determined on the basis of such estimates and assumptions for which changes during a financial
period could involve a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether there is any indication that a nonfinancial asset might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA plan
for each CGU as defined by us. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the
CGU or group of CGUs most likely to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and
to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by us. The CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or
groups of subsidiaries that are included in the same operating segment and that generate cash
flows largely independent from those generated by other CGUs.

The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result
following the changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment, we carry out impairment tests. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed
separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that
show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that we will
have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The calculation
of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits, with
regard to tax management strategies.

**_Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions regarding discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the

94


-----

rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates.

**_Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

# Industry

_This discussion contains market and competitive position data from industry publications and_
_from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources. Unless otherwise indicated, the_
_financial and operational data presented herein exclude Doyen Auto._

We are the leading distributor in the independent aftermarket segment of France for
aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks, which are used in their mainenance and
repair. These spare parts include mechanical parts, electrical parts and electronic components,
body parts (including headlights), assembly parts, tires, oils and lubricants, car paint, other
chemical products and accessories.

We generated 90.8% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016,
and the remaining 9.2% in Poland. We believe that as of December 31, 2015, we—as a network—
held a market share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light
vehicle IAM.

The light vehicle aftermarket is relatively complex compared to other industries, due to the large
number of market participants with varying business models. In general, the light vehicle
aftermarket can be divided into the following two segments:

  - the original equipment suppliers (“OES”) aftermarket segment, which is operated through
a distribution network directly connected to car manufacturers and generally consists of
authorized garages managed by car dealers; the OES segment’s core target vehicle is aged
between one and six years on average; and

  - the independent aftermarket for spare parts (“IAM”), which is operated by independent
distributors and garages as well as car centers, fastfits, tire specialists and hyper/
supermarkets that are not connected to car manufacturers and which typically service all of
the vehicles operating on the road without making a distinction between brands. The IAM
segment’s core target vehicle is aged beyond seven years on average.

OES and IAM suppliers sell their products to wholesalers and distributors which often operate on
a national level. Regional and local wholesalers frequently buy these products from national
wholesalers and distributors for further sale to garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers.

The following are the key participants in the IAM in France:

  - Purchasing group: A department making purchases on behalf of a larger group of
distributors. Consolidated purchases made through a purchasing group increase
bargaining power with suppliers and enable greater discounts on purchased parts.

  - Distributors: In the French OES, distribution is generally carried out by authorized resellers
of the manufacturers that supply authorized dealers. In the IAM, distribution is carried out
by independent distributors that supply products, depending on the specifics of the
geographic area in which they operate, to wholesalers (which, in turn, supply garages,
body shops, fast-fitters and car centers) or directly to garages, body shops, fast-fitters and
car centers, depending on the specifics of the geographic area in which they operate.

  - Garages (including body shops): Garages are either authorized by a car manufacturer or
manufacturers, or operate independently and do not maintain any relationship with a
particular manufacturer. Authorized garages generally specialize in the OES and, in
general, solely offer products and services relating to the vehicles produced by the
manufacturer to which they are connected. Consequently, authorized garages only provide
services in relation to a limited range of vehicles. By contrast, independent garages that
operate in the IAM generally offer services and repairs on all vehicles, without
distinguishing between vehicle manufacturers and models.

There are often exceptions to the supply chain described above, largely due to the expectations
of end-customers that garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers obtain light vehicle spare
parts in a timely manner. For example, larger garage networks or specialist repair center chains
often source particular light vehicle spare parts from an external wholesaler. In some cases,
authorized dealerships may source spare parts externally.

**Wholly-owned by Autodistribution** **Independent affiliated distributors**

### Differentiating factors between the IAM and the OES

Key factors considered by end-customers when deciding to use the services provided by the IAM,
rather than the OES, include:

  - the high flexibility and professionalism of IAM operators which allows them to provide
products and services for all brands and models;

  - the segment’s competitive pricing compared to OES;

  - the timely execution of maintenance and repair services, due to the efficiency of the IAM
distribution network and the capacity of independent garages to quickly obtain spare
parts that they may not have in stock; and

  - favorable regulation that allows IAM operators to have access to all technical details/
specifications/repairs for all car models.

### Development of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France

We participate in the aftermarket value chain as a business-to-business distributor of spare parts
for light vehicles and trucks.

The size of the French light vehicle aftermarket is estimated between €21 billion and €22 billion,
including product sales and workshop labor (market size estimated at the level of service centers
and not at the level of wholesale).

Within the French light vehicle aftermarket, sales of spare parts (product sales at the level of
service centers, excluding workshop labor, which is our core activity) were estimated at
approximately €12 billion in 2015, with approximately 60% for IAM and approximately 40% for
OES. The share of the market of independent garages, which is our key market segment, reached
approximately 25% in 2015.

The overall aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles is mature and has been broadly stable at
approximately €12 billion between 2010 and 2015. The independent garage segment grew at
approximately 4.5% per annum, hence increasing its share of the market over the same time
frame (at the expense of the OES segment and other IAM players) and should continue to grow
in the future.

### Key factors influencing the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France

We believe there are a number of factors impacting the overall light vehicle spare parts market
and contributing to its stability, including: (i) the number of vehicles on the road; (ii) miles
travelled; (iii) the age of vehicles on the road; (iv) the composition of vehicles on the road; (v)
technological developments and prices; (vi) regulation; and (vii) new distribution channels.

Independent garages are expected, in the near future, to continue to show growth due to a
continuous shift from OES to IAM.

**_Number of vehicles on the road_**

The total number of vehicles on the road is a key factor affecting the development of the spare
parts aftermarket. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 30.8 million light vehicles
(private vehicles only) on the road in France. Growth in the number of vehicles on the road is
measured by the number of new registrations over a certain period, minus the number of
vehicles retired during that period. The number of new registrations is influenced by a variety of
factors, including the purchasing power of the overall population, the density level of light
vehicles on the road and the availability of government incentives to purchase new vehicles (such
as the car-scrapping premium that was implemented in 2009). The number of light vehicles on
the road has slightly increased in recent years, at a CAGR of 0.3% between 2010 and 2015. New
registrations of light vehicles per year are expected to remain at approximately 1.9 million units
per annum in the near future.

2004 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 2015

**_Miles travelled_**

The need for maintenance and repair services is directly related to the number of miles travelled
by vehicles. For example, an increase in fuel prices, the adoption of government incentives to use
public transportation or disincentives to travel by car, may have an impact on the number of
miles travelled over a certain period.

The average number of miles travelled annually per car (private light vehicles) in France is
estimated at 12,990 km in 2015 and has been decreasing at a CAGR of approximately (0.9)%
between 2005 and 2015. Future trends are hard to predict as the negative impact of the
development of public transportation (such as trains or buses) could be offset by the decrease in
fuel prices and other technology changes (e.g., autonomous driving or ride hailing).

**_Age of light vehicles on the road_**

Light vehicles on the road can be divided into four categories of age: (i) zero to four years;
(ii) five to nine years; (iii) 10 to 14 years; and (iv) over 15 years, representing approximately 31%,
31%, 23% and 15%, respectively, of the overall light vehicles fleet in 2015.

-----

Between 2004 and 2015, the share of the ten to 14 years vehicle group increased from
approximately 20% to approximately 23% of the total fleet, which typically benefits IAM, while
the zero to four years vehicle group decreased from approximately 35% to approximately 31%.
In the same period, the five to nine years and over 15 years vehicle groups remained stable at,
respectively, approximately 31% and approximately 15% of the overall fleet.

The average age of light vehicles on the road in France has increased over the last few years,
reaching 8.8 years in 2015 compared to 7.7 years in 2005, and is expected to increase further,
resulting in a positive impact on spare parts sales and the number of workshop entries going
forward.

We believe that consumer preferences for services and repairs vary depending on the age of the
vehicle in question. Despite the fact that the quality of service and the validity or duration of a
vehicle warranty is generally not compromised by using services and parts sourced from
independent garages, consumers who own vehicles that are four years old or less typically use
authorized garages operating in the OES to perform related maintenance and repair services
because their vehicles are typically covered by manufacturer warranties. We believe that
consumers who own vehicles that are more than four years old increasingly prefer to have their
cars serviced by independent garages. This is primarily due to the expiration of car warranties
and the fact that these particular consumers are more concerned with the pricing of services and
parts, which is typically a favorable development for the IAM. As a result, spare parts supplied for
vehicles over six years old constitute the majority of the IAM as cars age. We expect the IAM to
capture a higher share of the market as the average age of vehicles in France increases.

Other factors potentially impacting the industry are linked to political decisions, such as partial or
total diesel banning, incentives for increased adoption of electric vehicle and new car-scrapping
programs that are not foreseeable in the near future but could have an impact on average age of
the fleet, in the medium term.

**_Composition of vehicles on the road_**

The composition of vehicle makes and models on the road is largely determined by the
purchasing power and preferences of end-customers. Such composition influences the frequency
of maintenance and repair services, the average price of spare parts used for repairs and the
overall development of the IAM.

The number of models and OEMs have increased significantly over the past 20 years. This
increasing heterogeneity in vehicle brands has led to an increased need to be able to offer a wide
variety of spare parts. This increasing complexity benefits the IAM over the OES, due to its
management of the proliferation of different brands, ability to address a larger and more diverse
customer base, and greater economies of scale.

**_Technological developments and prices_**

Technological developments in the light vehicle industry generally lead to an increase in the
quality of vehicles available, as well as the components used in car manufacturing becoming
more complex. While an increase in quality generally results in an increase in the durability of
vehicle components, it also tends to lead to an increase in the average price of spare parts.
Furthermore, there is a general trend towards the use of modules in automobiles, which are
more expensive to replace than single parts.

The increasing complexity of vehicle components could also impact the growth potential of the
IAM, because service providers will need to develop their vehicle expertise, technical capabilities
and data accessibility to continue to provide minimum maintenance and repair services. In the
last ten years, approximately 50 sensors on average have been introduced in cars, and this
number is expected to double in the next five years.

**_Regulation_**

The European regulatory environment directly affects the European light vehicle aftermarket,
and has been generally favorable to IAM operators in recent years. The general trend has been
towards granting the IAM full access to the market by limiting restrictions on independent
manufacturers selling automobile parts to authorized or independent distributors and garages,

99


-----

and end-customers. In addition, the current regulatory framework requires that the OES grant
IAM operators full access to relevant technical information and permits only certain limitations
on vehicle warranties.

The Consumer Law of March 2014 is expected to reinforce the public awareness that car owners
are not at risk of jeopardizing their warranty by taking their vehicles to an independent garage.
Since January 1, 2015, it has been a legal requirement to make a vehicle owner aware of its right
to use an independent garage in the vehicle maintenance booklet.

With the average age of vehicles increasing, technical controls could also become stricter, which
would increase the volume of workshop entries, benefiting the IAM, in particular.

**_New distribution channels_**

With the development of web-based databases, both garages and end-customers are able to
identify, source and order required spare parts via the internet. This relatively new distribution
channel will be key in retaining and capturing market share going forward because customers
will formulate their purchasing decisions while engaging with these internet databases.

Online retailers, however, are expected to gain limited additional market shares in the future as
we believe they already have reached their full potential for the type of spare parts they can
address. Going forward, online retailers are expected to continue to focus on easy-to-install wear
and maintenance spare parts such as plugs or brake pads. They are not expected to develop their
presence with respect to complex or technical parts such as turbos for which end-customers
would rather rely on professionals providing installation services.

### Competitive landscape in France

At the end of 2015, the French light vehicle aftermarket spare part sales were estimated to be
approximately €12 billion at the level of service centers and excluding workshop labor. At the
wholesale level, the market is estimated to be approximately €9.6 billion with IAM representing
approximately 52%. The resulting approximately €5.0 billion IAM market is the best estimate of
our addressable market (since we predominantly sell to service centers).

We estimate our market share has reached approximately 11.5% of the overall light vehicle spare
parts market at the wholesale level in 2015, while reaching approximately 22% of the IAM
segment.

- Groupauto France and Precisium/GEFA are both owned by Alliance Automotive Group, our main competitor in France, but
they operate as separate purchasing groups.
** Spare parts market considering product sales at wholesale price, and not at retail price, excluding workshop labor.

Main French OEMs, such as PSA and Renault, seem to be looking into developing their presence
in the multibrands spare parts market. PSA and Renault could thus reach older vehicles of their
own installed base or target vehicles from other brands, which have been the historical
positioning of IAM.

For instance, PSA has recently launched “Distrigo,” a brand aimed at assembling all its
multibrands spare parts activities, including its 37 platforms in France, twelve of which are its
subsidiaries. PSA has also taken a stake in Aramisauto, the French leader in online used-car sales,
in order to develop this activity and associated services.

Notwithstanding, this trend is not likely to result in a significant increase in market share as
OEMs need to balance this strategy with their historical OES activities and would require
investment in broader product assortment, availability of parts and logistics.

### Focus on heavy vehicles

In the heavy goods vehicle (“HGV”) market, Autodistribution provides spare parts and
maintenance/repair services. The HGV repair market is estimated to have been approximately
€5.5 billion in 2014 (including sales of spare parts at service center prices, i.e., not at wholesale
prices, and including workshop labor). The HGV market is driven by the aging of the fleet,
leading to increasing repair costs, the growing sophistication of HGVs and an increase in average
annual mileage.

_HGV fleet: HGVs include different types of motorized vehicles (trucks, road tractors, coaches and_
buses and other specialized vehicles such as ambulances, garbage trucks and fire trucks) and nonmotorized vehicles (semi-trailers and trailers). The French HGV fleet reached 1.10 million units as
of December 31, 2015, with 0.7 million motorized vehicles and 0.4 non-motorized vehicles. The
French HGV fleet has slightly increased over the period from 2011 to 2015 period at a
approximately 1.3% CAGR. After a drop in 2014, registrations are expected to stabilize, and the
car parc should remain stable by 2019.

_Age of French HGV fleet: As a result, the French HGV fleet has aged, leading to increasing repair_
costs. Over the past few years, the HGV fleet has aged as a consequence of fewer registrations,
especially from 2009 to 2010. Tougher economic conditions have forced operators to postpone
fleet renewal programs. The aging of the French HGV fleet has benefited Autodistribution and
the overall independent segment, as Autodistribution typically focuses on seven to eight year old
vehicles, in comparison to OES focusing on vehicles fewer than six years old. Going forward, the
fleet of vehicles fewer than six years old is expected to remain the core market of the OES
players, as new vehicles are increasingly equipped with remote monitoring devices enabling it to
optimize maintenance, resulting in strong captivity for the OES segment. Similarly, the fleet of
vehicles greater than six years old will remain predominantly addressed by the independent
sector as customers value their large network and their capacity to offer lower and harmonized
prices in their entire network.

_Miles travelled: Annual mileage per vehicle is correlated with economic activity and is expected_
to increase over the next few years, driven by an improving economic environment. Average
annual mileage for HGVs reached approximately 32,000 km in 2015, with long-haul trucks easily
covering 120,000 km per annum. As in the light vehicles market, the increase in annual mileage
will impact demand for wear parts, and more generally parts subject to recurrent replacement
(oil change, lubricants, tires, etc.)

_Spare parts price: Increased sophistication of HGVs results in more complex repair operations, as_
HGVs contain more and more embedded electronics and technical parts. Repair operations on
HGVs become increasingly complex, as they require specific and expensive tools and equipment,
such as electronic diagnostic tools, but also highly skilled and well-trained mechanics. The Euro 6
regulation on emission standards for trucks, which became effective in 2014, is typically expected
to contribute to the increase in spare part prices.

_Competitive environment: The French HGV spare parts and maintenance market is shared_
between OES holding approximately 60% of the market, IAM with a approximately 25% market
share and fleet operator internal workshops (only including labor, excluding spare parts sales
which are necessarily purchased via the two other channels) with an approximately 15%
remaining market share. In the approximately €1.3 billion market segment held by IAM players,
Autodistribution holds an approximately 18% market share with approximately €235 million
sales (at wholesale prices). Overall Autodistribution is the number one independent player in
number of outlets, the number two overall market player behind Renault Trucks, and the
number one independent player in terms of awareness.

# Business

_Unless otherwise indicated, the financial and operational data presented herein exclude Doyen_
_Auto._

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM
in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish
light vehicle IAM and, since the acquisition of Doyen Auto on September 30, 2016, in the Benelux
light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to
the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we generated revenue of €1,425.8 million, of which 86.6% was
generated in France and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including Doyen Auto) of €115.2 million.
We believe that as of August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Auto
Acquisition, we held a market share in excess of 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented
French light vehicle IAM. Following the Doyen Auto Acquisition, we believe that we hold a
market share of approximately 21.0% in terms of revenue in the Benelux light vehicle IAM. Our
addressable market has demonstrated resilience in recent years and currently benefits from
advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with significant purchasing power with
aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network throughout France, which we have
expanded with the ACR Acquisition in April 2014 and more recently, the Doyen Auto Acquisition
on September 30, 2016, allows us to deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 281 suppliers. We have also
distributed light vehicle parts across the Benelux IAM since the completion of the Doyen Auto
Acquisition.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France and Benelux is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy
aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors and online retailers. These
distributors sell these parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fastfitters, fleet garages for light vehicles and trucks, and car centers (“garages”), some of which are
affiliated with us and operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”).

Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to garages represented 75.7% of our revenue in France
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, and sales by us to affiliated independent
distributors represented 24.2% of our revenue in France over the same period. As of August 31,
2016, we had a network of 33 wholly-owned distributors and 44 affiliated independent
distributors in France. These distributors operate out of 493 distribution sites, comprising 307
wholly-owned and 186 affiliated distribution sites, which are supplied either by our four
warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle collision repair parts and one for
truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use a customized IT system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44
distribution sites. In Benelux, we have operated three warehouses and 107 affiliated distribution
sites since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 70,000 regular
professional customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

102


-----

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

Of the €846.1 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 52.6%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
16.4%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.2%; and
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.8%. The remaining €270.8 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2016, was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Our strengths

**_Attractive, stable and resilient light vehicle aftermarket_**

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car parc”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has generally proven
resilient during economic downturns, when new car sales tend to decline. This resilience is due in
part to several positive trends that we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a stable
car parc size, a continuing increase in the average age of the car parc, increasingly complex and
technologically advanced vehicle parts, and advantageous regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions
in which we operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in which we
operate has led to an increase in the average age of the car parc, resulting in a growing share of
cars beyond the manufacturer warranty period and in need of repair and maintenance.
Independent garages sourcing IAM-provided spare parts create value for owners of such beyondwarranty period cars looking for an alternative to generally more expensive manufacturers’
dealers’ garages.

**_Leading distributor in the profitable French independent aftermarket sector_**

We are the leading distributor of parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in France, with
over 50 years of experience. As of August 31, 2016, and giving pro forma effect to the Doyen
Auto Acquisition, we held an estimated market share in excess of 22% in terms of revenue in the
fragmented French light vehicle IAM. Our leading position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand
and our extensive distribution network provide us with a strong platform to deliver a broad
range of spare parts, equipment and tools on a timely and efficient basis. We enjoy a strong
regional position in the light vehicle IAM in Poland, through our wholly-owned distributors in
southern Poland, and in Benelux, since the completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability for customers. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive
distribution network organized around our central purchasing departments, four specialized
national warehouses and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for the
direct supply of spare parts and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are
handled separately from our logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the
supplier, we use a customized IT system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain
and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our
distribution system is also capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to
efficiently handle high volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and,

103


-----

ultimately, driving increased customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution
system taking into account each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our
operational flexibility and efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of
service to our customers. For example, we separated our light vehicles and trucks spare product
lines into two distinct business units in order to optimize their supply chains and capitalize on
their respective efficiencies.

Our vertically integrated distribution system and extensive network of distributors and garages
provide us with a competitive advantage over smaller operators because smaller operators lack
our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a founding partner of
the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest European purchasing networks of
independent distributors for spare parts, which further enhances our purchasing power, allows us
to obtain rebates and gives us access to best practices of other AD International partners abroad.
We believe that the advantages of our vertically integrated distribution system are difficult to
replicate because of the significant time and resources that would be required to reproduce our
existing infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a large
customer base of light vehicle and truck garages across France and Benelux. As of August 31,
2016, we served more than 70,000 regular professional customers in France, including our
approximately 3,200 branded garages, and several hundred thousand individual professional
customers. We service our customers through both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent
distributors. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, 75.7% of our revenue in France was
generated by sales to garages and over-the-counter sales through our wholly-owned distributors,
and 24.2% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors
that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient distribution network and
our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on a timely and efficient
basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to develop and maintain our
large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers targeted by our wholly-owned
distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not overlap due to the commercial
arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated independent distributors. In addition, we
are focused on developing new customer segments, such as online retailers that are major
customers of Doyen Auto. We have also set up a separate sales department dedicated to
insurance clients in order to strengthen our commercial relationships with these companies and
increase our share of the collision repair market.

**_High-quality service based on extensive product portfolio, highly efficient operations and_**
**_customized IT systems_**

Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately one million commonly used spare parts from
over 281 suppliers, including a new product line for windscreens. We believe that our suppliers
view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for the IAM, which allows
us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse range of suppliers. This is
because we are one of the few distributors in our market with the scale, warehouse logistics,
distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and distribute a large number of
spare parts, equipment and tools for an increasingly complex market with high barriers to entry.
We also believe that this gives us an advantage against competition from OES, which need to
combine their historical OES activities with the complex IAM market and would require
investment in a broader product assortment, availability of parts and logistics in order to
compete with the range of products we distribute, the availability of parts we offer, our strong
logistics and the quality of our services. The number of car and truck brands and models in the
car park continues to increase and, as a result, the related assortment of car and truck spare parts
increases each year. We believe that our extensive product portfolio, combined with our
extensive range of services, make us attractive to the growing number of multi-brand garages
that are moving away from single-brand, manufacturer specific dealers.

Our logistics platforms are well invested and allow us to operate industry-leading distribution
networks. As of August 31, 2016, Logisteo, our central warehouse from which we distribute spare

104


-----

parts for light vehicle repair and maintenance, was the largest independent logistics platform for
light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France, with over 20,000 square meters of
storage space that stored approximately 56,800 spare parts references of 124 brands. It supplies
493 distribution sites, comprising 307 wholly-owned and 186 affiliated distribution sites, and
employs approximately 280 people. Since July 2015, we have made significant investments in the
automation of the processes in our Logisteo warehouse in order to improve the accuracy and
speed with which products are delivered to customers and increase our product offering. As of
August 31, 2016, we had already invested €16.4 million in this project and expect that completion
of the project during the course of the next nine months will generate cost savings for us in the
long term. In 2013, we also invested in the expansion of our call center for our collision repair
service in order to improve the quality of our service for our collision business customers.

Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platforms allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items
and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online business-tobusiness car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and Truckissimo,
respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly order from a
large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby improving the
customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe that these web portals
provide us with a competitive advantage, and approximately €138.7 million, or 21.0%, of our
revenue from sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, were placed
through our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services
we offer drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.

Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. In late 2013 and early 2014, we upgraded the warehouse IT management
system of our light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the
process of upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a
tablet-based program that allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and
to make suggestions for purchases based on the customer’s profile. We believe that our IT
systems provide us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a
timely and efficient basis.

As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts, equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to operate
efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our marketleading positions. As a result, we have made, and expect to continue to make in the future,
appropriate investments in IT.

**_Strong financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light_**
**_business model_**

Since 2013 we have generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA margin from 4.9%
to 7.6%, and maintained stable cash flow generation despite a slowdown in economic activity in
France in recent years, with a cash conversion (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditure, divided by Adjusted EBITDA) of 68.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013,
73.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, 70.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, and
72.0% for the twelve-month period ended August 31, 2016, and a cash conversion (excluding
exceptional capital expenditure) of 86.9% for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We
have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement during the last six years by implementing a
series of profit enhancement measures. Since these measures were implemented, our Adjusted
EBITDA has increased from €29 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, to €93.7 million
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. These measures include, among others: the
maximization of suppliers’ rebates via increased purchasing by our central purchasing
departments and integrated Group-wide purchasing (including our affiliated independent

distributors), cost reductions in the aggregate compensation of local management and
administration through the implementation of shared services, and reductions in transportation
and logistics costs by optimizing the delivery routes between our distribution sites and our
customers and increasing the use of central distribution facilities. In addition, we improved our
cash flows from operating activities (including changes in working capital and other items with
cash effect) from €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to €54.4 million for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We operate a capex-light business model using rented
facilities, and thus our operations do not require us to own or maintain extensive physical
infrastructure. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, our capital expenditures
amounted to 2.8% of our revenue and consisted of maintenance expenditures for our
distribution facilities, and upgrades to our sales and warehouse IT management systems, as well
as our first investment in Logisteo’s automation process development. Our low levels of
maintenance capital expenditure requirements (as a percentage of revenue) have allowed us to
invest in our business, maintain our leading market positions, improve operating efficiency and
achieve deleveraging through Adjusted EBITDA growth and cash generation.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, and our Group CFO, Christophe
Gouthière, have more than 70 years of combined experience in the distribution and light vehicle
sectors and have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth
strategies. Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, is the former co-CEO of the Rhiag Group, a leading
distributor in the Italian, Swiss and Eastern European light vehicle aftermarkets, and has
extensive experience in the light vehicle aftermarket. Our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, is the
former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Our Group
CFO, Christophe Gouthière, was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading
distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our Chairman, Group CEO and Group CFO, supported by
an experienced management team, have successfully implemented profit improvement initiatives
and integrated new businesses into our Group. For example, our management team successfully
integrated ACR in 2014 and timely realized slightly higher purchasing and cost savings and
revenue enhancements than those identified at the time of the ACR Acquisition. We believe that
the success of our management team in completing our profit improvement plan and returning
our business to profitable growth has laid a solid foundation for further growth and increased
profitability. The support, investment experience and sector expertise of our sponsor, Bain
Capital, will supplement the leadership and expertise of our management team.

### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience and a focus on the breadth of product
assortment, availability of parts, strong logistics and quality of customer service, we believe that
we are well positioned to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light
vehicle IAM. To accomplish this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our
sales force performance and practices, develop new key accounts, expand our commercial
relationships with fast-fitters and enhance the efficiency of our supply chain for express orders.
We may also seek from time to time to make selective acquisitions that are accretive to our
network. As part of this strategy, we acquired ACR in 2014 and Doyen Auto in 2016, and are
currently considering the acquisition of another small spare parts distributor. The latter
transaction is at an early stage, and is subject to completion of due diligence and the negotiation
of contractual documentation. There is therefore no assurance that we will complete it in the
near term or at all. Should we complete such acquisition, we expect to finance it with cash from
operations and existing liquidity lines, and we believe that it would have no materially negative
impact on our ratio of net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA. Doyen Auto is a distributor of
spare parts for light vehicles in France and Benelux. For the twelve months ended August 31,
2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of €196.0 million and €8.9 million,
respectively.

106


-----

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a CAGR of 11.9% between 2010 and 2015.
We intend to leverage our logistics platforms, competitive prices and high levels of service to
continue to win new contracts with insurance companies for our collision repair services. We plan
to channel this business to our branded garages in order to strengthen our partnerships with
such garages and insurers and increase demand for the provision of collision repair parts from
our distributors.

**_Enhance customer service_**

We intend to continue to enhance our high-quality service to our customers by ensuring seamless
execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already extensive product
assortment. We believe that timely product delivery, our range of spare parts on offer, and
efficient and effective order execution will continue to drive customer loyalty. We plan to
shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. The ACR Acquisition has
allowed us to benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its specialization
in deliveries within two to four hours of placing an order. With the completion of the Doyen
Auto Acquisition, we have increased our ability to deliver spare parts in rural areas of France,
where a majority of API distributors are located. We will also benefit from Doyen Auto’s
experience in sales to online retailers to enhance the quality of our services in this segment. We
seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to capture
market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand our
portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line for
the light vehicle and truck aftermarket and the private label product line of ACR for the light
vehicle aftermarket. We plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We believe
that this approach will allow us to address different types of customers with different value
propositions, ultimately optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase in
private label product lines as a percentage of our total revenues will improve our
competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources
and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations and reduce
fixed costs in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further standardize our central
administration and enhance our IT support in order to implement these changes. In addition, we
intend to continue to invest in our logistics platforms in order to reduce costs, facilitate
operational efficiencies, strengthen our supply chain and provide our customers with better
product coverage and availability. For example, we aim to open a new logistics platform in Réau,
France in 2017. By further enhancing existing software and installing new software, such as the
recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform,
we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of orders. We also intend to
further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our EBITDA margins in Poland pursuant
to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, we expect
Doyen Auto to realize purchasing savings by purchasing spare parts under our existing
arrangements with our suppliers, which provide better commercial terms compared to Doyen

107


-----

Auto’s contracts. We estimate that the integration of Doyen Auto will result in approximately
€12.6 million of identified annualized anticipated purchasing and cost savings. Additionally, we
are focused on increasing the share of purchases made by our affiliated independent distributors
through our central purchasing departments, which we expect will further increase our sales
volumes and improve our purchasing power.

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 9.3% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, which target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. The integration of ACR in 2014, which serves
online light vehicle spare parts retailers, increased our presence in this segment of the IAM.
Whether an order is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely
over-the-counter product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to onlineonly light vehicle spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts.
We regularly assess our over-the-counter sales vis-à-vis our existing business-to-business sales
objectives in terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our over-the-counter
sales on our business-to-business sales.

**_Integrate Doyen Auto into our business_**

Upon completion of the Doyen Auto Acquisition, Doyen Auto became an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer. Doyen Auto is a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles in
the IAM in France and Benelux, mainly through its network of affiliated distributors API (165
distributors), and serves a diverse customer base, including online retailers, affiliated distributors
and two networks of branded garages, 1,2,3 AutoService (297 garages) and Requal (435 garages).
The Doyen Auto Acquisition has increased our market share in the French spare parts
aftermarket, has given us a leading position in the fast-growing online retail segment, in which
Doyen Auto is already a leader in France, has expanded our business to Benelux and, we believe,
will enable us to realize further significant procurement, logistics and distribution savings and
cost efficiencies.

Following the integration of Doyen Auto into our business using an approach similar to that used
for the successful integration of ACR, we expect to realize approximately €12.6 million of
annualized anticipated purchasing and cost savings (compared to 2015 costs) based on a report
prepared by Kepler S.A.S., a consultant that we hired in connection with the Doyen Auto
Acquisition. We expect to realize €10.6 million of identified purchasing savings per year resulting
from having Doyen Auto purchase spare parts under our existing arrangements with our
suppliers, which provide for better commercial terms, compared to Doyen Auto’s existing supply
contracts, in line with the renegotiating strategy that we successfully implemented following the
ACR Acquisition. These savings are expected to come into effect simultaneously with the
integration of Doyen Auto into our business, which we expect to be largely completed in the first
half of 2017, and without additional cost. We also expect to realize approximately €2 million of
additional annualized cost savings by the end of 2018 (compared to 2015 costs) from the
integration of corporate, IT and other central functions and through optimization of our
footprint, particularly in France. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We may face
_challenges in integrating acquired businesses and in integrating any future potential acquisition,_
_and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these businesses and any other cost_
_improvement measures we have taken.”_

### History

We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation between a number of existing
independent light vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key link throughout
France between original equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and
local spare parts distributors, garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand.
In 1983, we expanded our footprint throughout France, both at the distributor level and the
garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and rolling out our concept
of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers and were independent from

108


-----

Autodistribution. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors
and trailers. It was the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France.

In 2007, we entered the Polish market by purchasing three local distributors that currently form
the core distributors of AD Polska. In 2009, we entered the Italian market and formed AD Italy.
We sold our majority stake in AD Italy in 2012.

Throughout our history, we have expanded our business through organic growth and strategic
acquisitions. We enhanced our logistics platform through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading
independent French distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair, in 2005 and Bremstar, a
distributor with a logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008.
We also acquired Gobillot Rhône (previously Enssemble), a network of light vehicle spare parts
distributors, in 2012, and FPLS, a truck spare parts distributor, in 2013. In December 2013, we
acquired Rougon Queyrel, a distributor of spare parts for light vehicles in southeastern France. In
April 2014, we acquired ACR, a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light vehicles.
On September 30, 2016, we acquired Doyen Auto. See “—Doyen Auto Acquisition” below.

Having realized at an early stage that the internet offered innovative opportunities for light
vehicle and truck spare parts distributors, we created the Autossimo online business-to-business
light vehicle repair and maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online business-tobusiness truck repair and maintenance web portal in 2001. We have also developed our own
private label, ISOTECH, which features spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks, such as
batteries and lubricants, which was relaunched in 2008.

We were acquired by our current principal shareholder, Bain Capital, in 2015. See “Principal
_shareholders.”_

_Safeguard (procédure de sauvegarde)_

Between February 18, 2009 and April 6, 2009, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor were subject
to safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) opened by the Commercial Court of Evry.
Safeguard proceedings in France are a commercial court-led process opened on a voluntary basis
by a company in which such company seeks court protection from creditors in order to achieve a
restructuring plan.

In 2009, before the opening of our safeguard proceedings in February, we signed a restructuring
agreement with our creditors approving our debt restructuring and our equity-financed majority
acquisition by TowerBrook. The safeguard proceedings allowed the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor to confirm and implement the restructuring plan contemplated in the restructuring
agreement, thereby reducing the impact of the restructuring on our primary operating company
Autodistribution S.A., its central purchasing departments, its subsidiaries and its network, which
were not materially affected by this procedure and continued to operate in the ordinary course
of business.

On April 6, 2009, the Commercial Court of Evry adopted safeguard plans for the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor, thereby ending the safeguard proceedings in respect of the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor. During the implementation of the safeguard plans, the relationships of the
Issuer and the Parent Guarantor with their creditors were governed by the provisions of their
respective safeguard plans. Those creditors were repaid in full and, as a result, the Commercial
Court of Evry acknowledged the completion of the safeguard plans by two judgments, each
dated as of October 2, 2014, pursuant to which the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor are no
longer subject to the safeguard proceedings.

_Doyen Auto Acquisition_

On September 30, 2016, Autodistribution S.A. acquired the entire issued share capital of DA and
Ariane, the two holding companies of the group Doyen Auto, pursuant to an acquisition
agreement dated June 27, 2016, entered into between the Parent Guarantor and Doge Invest.

Doyen Auto is a Belgium-headquartered distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles
established in 1922 by the Doyen family. Doyen Auto has operations in France and Benelux and
serves a diverse customer base of over 1,300 customers, including online retailers, affiliated
distributors and two networks of branded garages, 1,2,3 AutoService (297 garages) and Requal
(435 garages). Doyen Auto is the leading distributor of light vehicle spare parts to online retailers
in France and the second largest distributor in the IAM in Belgium.

109


-----

Doyen Auto sells spare parts mainly through its network of affiliated distributors API (165
distributors), which are established in Belgium and in rural areas in France where our whollyowned and affiliated distributors had a limited presence prior to the Doyen Auto Acquisition. For
the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, approximately 60% of Doyen Auto’s revenue was
generated by its operations in France, approximately 30% by its operations in Belgium and
approximately 11% by its operations in the Netherlands. For the year ended December 31, 2015,
approximately 61% of Doyen Auto’s revenue was generated by its operations in France,
approximately 29% by its operations in Belgium and approximately 9% by its operations in the
Netherlands. Sales to online retailers, API distributors and wholesalers contributed to
approximately 39%, 38% and 15%, respectively, of Doyen Auto’s revenue in France for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

Doyen Auto operates six logistics platforms, which represent approximately 56,000 square meters
of storage, and, as of August 31, 2016, stored over 80,000 spare parts references of 150 brands.
Doyen Auto has approximately 19,100 square meters of storage space in France across three
logistics platforms, located in Castelnau d’Estretefonds, Gennevilliers and Corbas. These new sites
in southern France will allow us to serve customers in Spain and northern Europe. In Benelux,
Doyen Auto has approximately 28,000 square meters of storage space in Seneffe, Belgium, and
8,900 square meters of storage space across two logistics platforms in Zwolle and Waalwijk, the
Netherlands. The three logistics platforms in Benelux distribute spare parts to affiliated and
wholly-owned distributors, which sell them to garages and shops, or directly to end-customers.
As of August 31, 2016, Doyen Auto employed approximately 340 people.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, Doyen Auto generated revenue of €196.0 million
and Adjusted EBITDA of €8.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012
and 2011, Doyen Auto generated revenue of €196.3 million, €186.4 million, €183.0 million,
€161.0 million and €143.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
Doyen Auto generated Adjusted EBITDA of €8.6 million and €5.4 million, respectively.

We believe that the Doyen Auto Acquisition will allow us to grow our market share in the French
spare parts aftermarket, establish a leading position in the fast-growing online retail segment,
expand our business to Benelux and enable us to realize further significant procurement, logistics
and distribution savings and cost efficiencies.

### Our geographic markets

As of August 31, 2016, we primarily distributed our products in France and had a total of 33
wholly-owned and 44 affiliated independent distributors, as well as approximately 3,200 branded
garages, which participate in an affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service
and support from us, and in return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are
designated as their preferred distributor. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, 90.8%
of our revenue was generated by our operations in France. We have an extensive distribution
network in France for our light vehicle spare parts business line, with distributors in every region
of the country. Our central management and headquarters and most of our central purchasing
functions are located in Arcueil, near Paris. Two of our logistics platforms, Logisteo (which
distributes light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair) and Bremstar (which distributes truck
parts for maintenance and repair), are located in Moissy Cramayel and Pringy, in the Seine-etMarne department. Our Cora logistics platform (which distributes light vehicle parts for collision
repair) is located in Chaponnay and Corbas, in the Rhone department. Our ACR logistics platform
is located in Gennevilliers, in the Hauts-de-Seine department.

We also operate in Poland, where we are a leading light vehicle spare parts distributor, with a
distribution network of three warehouses and 44 wholly-owned distributors. For the twelve
months ended August 31, 2016, 9.2% of our revenue was generated by our operations in Poland.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, approximately 52.6% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the distribution of spare parts for the
maintenance and repair of light vehicles. As of August 31, 2016, 26 of our 33 wholly-owned
distributors and 32 of our 44 affiliated independent distributors sell a full range of light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair, including engine parts, brakes and batteries, in all regions of
France through 357 distribution sites.

We also distribute spare parts for the maintenance and repair of light vehicles to independent
garages, including 2,453 branded garages (as of August 31, 2016). This network includes 2,014
“AD” branded garages, of which 1,089 are designated “Garage AD Expert,” identifying them as
providing end-customers with both routine maintenance and more complex repair services; two
AD Autoservices, which are multi-service garages offering maintenance, repair and bodywork
services; 1,003 Auto Primo garages; and 82 Staff Auto garages. We developed our network of
branded garages based on population density in particular areas. For example, in rural areas we
aim to have one branded garage for every 15,000 inhabitants living within a 15-kilometer radius
of that garage. Our branded garages perform repair services for all major light vehicle brands
and models and use our integrated diagnostic tools.

In addition, we have entered into service agreements for light vehicle parts for maintenance and
repair with companies with large light vehicle fleets, as well as partnerships with fast-fitters and
car centers.

_Private label_

In 2008, we relaunched our private label ISOTECH product line, which currently comprises 14
product groups sold under our AD brand for the light vehicle aftermarket, including batteries,
lubricants, timing kits, water pumps and braking components. We primarily sell our ISOTECH
products directly to customers, either over the counter or through online sales. Our ISOTECH
products are currently offered at a discount rate of approximately 27% compared to prevailing
market prices, but generate a higher margin for us than third-party branded products.

111


-----

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Autossimo, which is an online business-to-business
light vehicle repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops with an online catalog
of more than 2.1 million spare parts, representing over 455 different original equipment
suppliers, and which has over 9,300 customers. The website offers continuously updated technical
databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use portal outlining repair methods,
connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price comparison tools by
brands, inventory access and an online ordering platform.

**_Light vehicle parts for collision repair_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, approximately 16.4% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the sale of light vehicle parts for collision
repair. The collision repair products that we distribute include a wide range of integrated
products and include individual parts and entire body components. We manage our collision
repair services through three-way partnerships among independent garages, insurers and us. Our
agreements with insurers are one-year agreements renewable on an annual basis.

We also distribute light vehicle parts for collision repair to independent body shops, including
653 branded body shops (as of August 31, 2016) operating under the “Carrosserie AD” brand. We
use our specialized logistics platform Cora for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision
repair to wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.

_Website_

We have our own call center that directly serves the customers of insurance companies. We are
also in the process of developing the website “Carrossimo,” which is an online business-tobusiness collision repair portal for body shops with a finalization scheduled for the beginning of
2017.

**_Truck parts for maintenance and repair_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, approximately 14.2% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the distribution of truck spare parts, for
which we are the leading independent distributor in France (based on our geographic network).
Our subsidiary Bremstar offers over 15,000 truck spare parts from 60 suppliers which we generally
stock in our warehouses for shipment on an expedited basis. As of December 31, 2015, 87 whollyowned distributors and 47 affiliated independent distributors were selling truck parts for
maintenance and repair.

We also distribute truck parts for maintenance and repair to 146 branded truck garages in France
(as of August 31, 2016) operating under our AD brands, of which 76 were wholly-owned and 70
were independent affiliates. We use our specialized logistics platform Bremstar for the delivery
of truck parts for maintenance and repair to our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated
independent distributors. We increased our footprint in the truck aftermarket by acquiring FPLS,
a truck parts distributor, in 2013.

_Private label_

Our ISOTECH product line for truck parts for maintenance and repair currently comprises five
groups of products that are sold under our AD brand for the truck aftermarket, such as batteries,
lubricants, water pumps or headlights.

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Truckissimo, which is an online business-to-business
truck repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops. The website offers
continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use portal
outlining repair methods, connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price
comparison tools by brand and inventory access.

112


-----

**_Equipment, tools and other_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, approximately 16.8% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the distribution and maintenance of
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We have a comprehensive
equipment and tool product offering, which includes garage equipment, such as light vehicles
lifts and diagnostic tools, personal safety equipment and tools, as well as a wide range of
technical parts such as lambda sensors, flow meters and turbochargers. We also provide
installation and other after-sales services for these products. Furthermore, we have developed
Diag’issimo, an interface that connects leading diagnostic tools with the Autossimo online light
vehicle repair and maintenance portal, providing over 3,200 customers and approximately 9,300
subscribers with an integrated solution from diagnostics to spare parts order placement.

### Our distribution platforms and end-customers

_France_

In France, we purchase light vehicle parts and sell them (i) through our wholly-owned distributors
to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers and (ii) to affiliated independent
distributors, with similar purchase prices for all distributors. We have a similar distribution model
for collision repair, for which our subsidiary Cora acts as central purchasing department and
warehouse, and for spare parts for trucks, for which our subsidiary Bremstar acts as central
purchasing department and warehouse. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, our
wholly-owned distributors generated 75.7% of our revenue through sales of spare parts to
garages and over-the-counter sales, and our sales to affiliated independent distributors
generated 24.2% of our revenue. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, our logistics
platforms generated 47.8% of our revenue, before deduction of intercompany sales.

As of August 31, 2016, we had a broad network of 33 wholly-owned distributors and 44 affiliated
independent distributors in France. These distributors operate out of 493 distribution sites which
are supplied either by our four main warehouses (one for light vehicle parts, one for collision
repair parts, one for truck parts and one for ACR) or through direct shipments from the supplier
to the distributor. As of August 31, 2016, 58 of our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated
independent distributors distribute light vehicle spare parts from 357 distribution sites (including
136 affiliated independent distributors and 221 wholly-owned distributors), and 46 of our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors distribute truck spare parts from 136
distribution sites (including 50 affiliated independent distributors and 86 wholly-owned
distributors).

We obtain rebates from our suppliers because we purchase products on a large scale, thereby
allowing our central purchasing departments to negotiate favorable contracts with our suppliers.
We pass on a portion of these rebates to affiliated independent distributors, and our whollyowned distributors pass on a portion of these rebates when they sell spare parts to garages.

Both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors on-sell to a variety of
end-customers, including independent light vehicle garages, over-the-counter sales, truck fleets,
car dealers, and auto centers and fast-fitters.

The following graph shows the percentage of revenue generated by our wholly-owned
distributors in France by end-customer type for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016.

Our principal end-customers are garages. We meet garages’ requirement to have up to eight
deliveries per day and, in the case of certain fast-moving parts (parts for which there is a high
demand), may require delivery within two hours of order. We provide next business day
deliveries for slow-moving items (parts for which there is a lower demand). Garages also need
technical support to assist them with diagnostics, the identification of parts and repair methods,
and the ordering of tools. In addition, garages require frequent training, as spare parts and
related repairs become more technologically complex. We provide all these services, replicating
for garages what light vehicle manufacturers provide for their own affiliated network of
garages, but with the added complexity of providing these services for all light vehicle models.

We also provide truck spare parts to truck fleet companies, which are equipment services
providers that specialize in the leasing and rental of trailers, tankers and other equipment, as
well as maintenance, damage repair, fleet management and telematics, requiring the truck fleet
company to have truck spare parts readily available or delivered in a short period of time.

In addition, we distribute spare parts through our wholly-owned distributors to over-the-counter
customers, including, among others, semi-professional and “do-it-yourself” customers. Our overthe-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 9.3% of our
revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016.

_Poland_

Our Polish distribution system is similar to our French distribution system, except that in Poland
we distribute parts only to wholly-owned distributors. Our three warehouses in Poland store over
95,000 spare parts and distribute these parts to our wholly-owned distributors, which sell them to
garages and shops, most of which are located in the south of Poland. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2016, 36.5% of our revenue in Poland was generated by sales to retail shops,
28.1% was generated by sales to garages and 19.4% was generated by sales to car centers and
others. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, sales at our Polish distributors consisted
primarily of spare parts, called “extended spare parts” (93.8% of our sales in Poland with 62.6%
of pure spare parts, 1.7% of tools and equipment, 2.6% of body parts and 0.1% of painting),
lubricants (14.2% of our sales in Poland), tires (6.9% of our sales in Poland) and batteries (5.1%
of our sales in Poland). Our distributors are able to make up to eight deliveries per day to our
customers, which helps to ensure the loyalty of our customers. We have also developed a
network of more than 485 branded garages, including 163 AD garages and AD Serwis garages,
23 AD Karoseria garages and 299 Auto Primo garages in order to increase our brand recognition
in Poland. Our Polish distributors primarily use their automated platform to generate and track
orders, with sales through this platform accounting for more than 66% of our revenue in Poland
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We also have three call centers and over 90 sales
staff in Poland.

### Supply and procurement

Our distribution system in France is organized around our four main central purchasing
departments, which buy aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers,
which are then sold to our wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors.
Our four main central purchasing departments are: Logisteo for light vehicle parts for
maintenance and repair; Cora for light vehicle parts for collision repair; Bremstar for truck parts
for maintenance and repair; and ACR for light vehicle parts. These central purchasing
departments implement our procurement policy and negotiate prices for the approximately one
million commonly used spare parts that we purchase directly from over 281 suppliers. We buy
substantially all of the products that we distribute directly from spare parts manufacturers, which
we believe allows us to use our scale and centralized purchasing function to obtain favorable
prices, rebates and other terms.

We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. For
example, we select our brake or battery suppliers every three years. When selecting our suppliers,
we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as a supplier’s
ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. We enter into annually renewable
contracts with our suppliers, which include standard terms and conditions, such as rebates if we
deliver the products to the distributors or inflation adjustments for pricing. We negotiate
supplier rebates on an annual basis. These supplier rebates primarily consist of year-end rebates
based on annual thresholds achieved, with monthly adjustments based on commercial and
logistics services. We believe that our scale and central purchasing functions have allowed us to
obtain better commercial terms from suppliers. We also invoice on a monthly basis additional
services linked to direct deliveries from our suppliers to our wholly-owned and affiliated
independent distributors, as well as deliveries by suppliers to our warehouses, or related logistics
services.

We use our central purchasing system to monitor customer purchases across our network and
seek to quickly change our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand. We seek to buy
in large quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offset the costs associated with
maintaining large inventories at our warehouses.

We also benefit from our AD International membership, a cross-border partnership among
distributors of aftermarket spare parts that allows members to benefit from reduced purchase
pricing through negotiations with suppliers on the basis of consolidated volumes, common
marketing concepts and best-practice sharing. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, AD
International had members in 33 countries.

During the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, our top 25 suppliers in France accounted for
59.8% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar). Our largest supplier in France, Robert
Bosch, accounted for 11.3% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar) and our secondlargest supplier, Shaeffler, accounted for 5.0% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar).
Except for Robert Bosch, no supplier in France accounted for more than 5% of our total
purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar) as of August 31, 2016.

### Logistics

We operate four main central logistics platforms in France (for light vehicle parts for
maintenance and repair, for light vehicle parts for collision repair and for truck parts for
maintenance and repair) to allow both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors to benefit from a full range of value added services and to respond to customer
expectations in terms of product availability and timely delivery. Our four main central logistics
platforms in France are:

  - Logisteo: Logisteo is our central warehouse from which spare parts for light vehicle
repair and maintenance are distributed. As of August 31, 2016, it was the largest
independent logistics platform for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France
and had over 20,000 square meters of storage space and stored approximately 56,860
spare parts references of 124 brands. It supplies approximately 490 distribution sites and
employs approximately 280 people (as of August 31, 2016). Deliveries of regular orders are
made within four business days and express orders by within the next business day.

115


-----

  - Bremstar: Bremstar was established in 1995, and we acquired it in 2008. It distributes
truck parts for maintenance and repair. It has over 10,000 square meters of storage space
and stores over 15,000 spare parts references. It supplies all of the 170 truck distribution
sites and employed over 41 people (as of August 31, 2016). Deliveries of regular orders are
made within five business days and express orders are made by the next business day.

  - Cora: Cora was established in 1967, and we acquired it in 2005. It distributes light vehicle
parts for collision repairs and has over 35,000 square meters of storage space and stores
over 70,000 spare parts references from 35 brands. It employed over 100 people (as of
August 31, 2016).

  - ACR: ACR was established in 2010, and we acquired it in 2014. It distributes light vehicle
parts. It has approximately 7,800 square meters of storage space, across our main
warehouse and eight smaller sites in France. It stores over 70,000 spare parts references. It
has nine distribution sites in France and employed over 176 people (as of August 31, 2016).
Deliveries of regular orders are made within four hours in 85% of the French territory
covered by ACR.

Of the total value of all products that we purchased from our referenced suppliers in France
during the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, products representing approximately 50% in
value were delivered through our main warehouses to our wholly-owned and affiliated
distributors and products representing approximately 50% in value were delivered directly to our
distributors by spare parts manufacturers. We plan to increase the amount of orders delivered
through our logistics platforms, which allows for bulk purchases on favorable conditions. We aim
to open a new logistics platform in Réau, France, which we expect to be operational by the
middle of 2017. This new platform will cover a surface of 32,000 square meters and is intended to
replace one of our logistics sites in Moissy-Cramayel, France.

The logistics department of each of our logistics platforms has the following primary
responsibilities:

  - Inbound _logistics:_ Accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring
compliance with the supply specifications negotiated by our supply chain department.

  - Stocking: Determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product, and the shelf
placement in accordance with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of
products within the dedicated space is crucial to optimize the available space in each of
our distribution centers.

  - Picking, packing and outbound logistics: The space management practices carried out by
our logistics department allows us to maximize efficiency in locating and retrieving
products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If products have
not been previously packaged by the suppliers, the logistics department is able to carry out
this activity.

  - Shipping: Organizing and monitoring transportation.

The transport of products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network is carried out
through independent carriers. Our logistics department is responsible for setting performance
targets and related incentives and penalties for third-party carriers, while continuously
monitoring the performance of carriers in order to improve customer service. We plan and
monitor product flows through our IT systems. We lease, rather than own, our distribution
centers, thereby limiting our permanent investment in fixed assets.

### Our contracts

In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into various contractual arrangements with our
suppliers, affiliated independent distributors, wholly-owned distributors and branded garages.

  - Suppliers: Our contracts with our suppliers are typically entered into for a one-year term,
without automatic renewal, and may include supply specifications regarding lead time, the
frequency of deliveries, packaging and performance targets for suppliers. These targets are
continuously monitored to ensure that our inventory is managed effectively and to
improve customer service. Bonuses or penalties may apply on a case-by-case basis,

116


-----

depending on whether targets are reached or not. Inventory levels in the distribution
centers are monitored by applying calculation procedures that may take into account,
among other things, current inventory levels and past analysis of customer demand.

  - Affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors: Our contractual
arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and
commercial contracts. Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent
distributors agree to operate under the AD brand and to receive our support services in
exchange for a membership fee. Our central purchasing departments enter into
commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors, which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both
affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors. Our affiliated
independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases made through our central
purchasing departments account for typically at least 70% of their overall purchase
volumes.

  - Branded garages: We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to
which they become branded garages in exchange for a membership fee.

### Sales

Our sales department is responsible for managing relationships with existing customers and
establishing relationships with new customers, setting sales targets and implementing sales
policies, which includes customer payment terms in cooperation with the finance and control
department and managing payment collection in cooperation with the administration
department.

Our sales department is divided between our two principal business lines: light vehicles and
trucks.

  - Light vehicles: This division supports our light vehicle spare parts distribution business. It
operates at the central, regional and local levels in order to address the fragmented
market of light vehicle parts distributors, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

  - Trucks: This division supports our truck spare parts distribution business. It operates at
the central, regional and local levels, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

### Marketing and advertising

Our marketing department is located in our headquarters in Arcueil (near Paris) and is focused on
improving awareness and perception of our brand. Our marketing and advertising expenses were
€6.6 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2016. We market our distribution services to
both affiliated independent distributors and garages, and engage in joint marketing campaigns
with our suppliers that target garage end-customers.

We continuously invest in our marketing efforts in order to sustain our sales and upgrade our
existing products. Our websites are one of our main marketing tools. They receive an average of
200,000 individual visits per month. We also regularly organize promotional campaigns for
certain of the light vehicle and truck spare parts that we distribute.

### Information technology

Our IT department is located in Chilly-Mazarin (near Paris) and plays an important role in our
distribution process and operations, since we rely on it to manage our sales, supply chain and
internal control. Our IT department supports our sales department, purchasing department,
logistics department and accounting department.

Our IT department, in coordination with our sales department, has developed software to
integrate our logistics platforms with an electronic interface that allows our customers to place
orders online and obtain information regarding the availability of the products that we
distribute, sales terms, conditions and shipping times. In 2012, our IT department also developed

117


-----

an eBook for our sales department, a tablet-based program that allows our sales representatives
to see previous customer orders and make suggestions for purchases based on the customer
profile.

Our IT department collaborates with our logistics department, primarily to update the software
and algorithms used to determine adequate inventory levels at our warehouses, product flows
and the optimal shelf positioning of the products that we distribute. For instance, we have
recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our light
vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. Our IT
system also enables us to determine product availability in real time and update the inventories
of our warehouses accordingly.

### Intellectual property

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks in our business. Except for the
trademarks Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, Autossimo, AD PL, the “AD” logo,
the garage names associated with the “AD” logo and ISOTECH, which are recognized brands in
the industry, we do not believe that any of our other trade names, service marks or trademarks
are material to our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws
to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We are not currently engaged in any
material intellectual property litigation, nor do we know of any material intellectual property
claims outstanding.

### Employees

As of August 31, 2016, we employed 5,995 people, of whom 5,219 were employed in France. The
following table sets forth the number of employees as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.

**As of December 31,**

In the last three years, we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a
result of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes that were specific to us. We believe that
our relations with our employees are good.

We attach great importance to providing high-quality and expert service to our customers.
Maintaining and repairing complex light vehicles and trucks requires well-trained and skillful
employees. Selling light vehicle and truck spare parts and equipment and tools also requires
expertise regarding the products and their use. We therefore provide our employees with a
broad range of training.

To ensure the continued professional development of our employees, we have established a
comprehensive training program. We have also created the Institut AD, which offers a number of
technical training modules through specialized training organizations and equipment
manufacturers.

### Competition

We face numerous sources of competition in the highly fragmented French and Polish spare parts
aftermarket in which we operate. See “Industry.”

Our main competitor in France is Alliance Automotive Group, which operates under four main
distribution networks in France: Groupauto, with 255 distribution sites; Precisium, with 292
distribution sites; Partner’s, with 231 distribution sites; and GEFA, with 150 distribution sites.
Alliance Automotive Group also operates ten different affiliation brands for light vehicle garages
and one affiliation brand of truck garages. Although the overall number of competitors has

118


-----

decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the IAM remains very competitive. Customers
select spare parts suppliers based on a number of factors, including product range and product
availability, service level, price and value-added services.

Our main competitors in Poland include Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union Polska.

Our main competitors in Benelux include VHIP (owned by LKQ) and BCC.

E-business provides limited competition in France and Poland, targeting mainly over-the-counter
retail markets, representing a relatively small portion of the overall market. The strong
development of the e-business during these last years has considerably impacted our “cash
client” sales. We have taken several initiatives, including the aggressive price positioning of our
ISOTECH products, to maintain a stable market share in this subsegment of the market. The ACR
Acquisition also allowed us to address the business through internet purchases without directly
competing with players in e-business.

### Properties

As of August 31, 2016, we operate a network of 33 wholly-owned distributors. As of August 31,
2016, we lease substantially all of our warehouses and distribution sites.

### Environment, health and safety

Although we do not manufacture the products we distribute, the storage of spare parts subjects
our facilities and operations to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws govern, among other
things, discharges of pollutants, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and waste,
and the clean-up of contaminated properties. Violations of environmental laws, applicable
authorizations or permits can result in significant fines or civil or criminal sanctions. In addition,
the discovery of contamination at our facilities could require us to incur substantial clean-up
costs.

Environmental authorizations or permits required for some of our operations may be reviewed,
modified or revoked by the issuing authorities. We believe that we are in material compliance
with the environmental laws applicable to our business. Our environmental and occupational
health and safety costs have not significantly affected our results of operations or financial
position during the previous twelve months.

### Insurance

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business,
including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fleet, damages and losses, and IT risk
insurance. All of our policies are underwritten with reputable insurance providers, and we
conduct yearly reviews of our insurance coverage with our broker and our insurance providers.
We believe that our insurance policies provide sufficient coverage of the risks facing our business.

### Legal proceedings

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of our business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers (such as the dispute
described below), disputes with our lessors at the renewal of our commercial leases and
intellectual property disputes. We are not currently involved in any legal proceedings which,
either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal
proceedings can be difficult to predict and we offer no assurance in this regard.

_Klarius S.A.S. vs. Autodistributions S.A._

On September 10, 2008, Klarius S.A.S., a manufacturer of light vehicle spare parts for
maintenance and repair in France, commenced proceedings against us and our subsidiaries
before the Chartres Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce), claiming that we unfairly
terminated our established commercial relationship with them. We argued that Klarius S.A.S.’s
claim was not valid, since Klarius S.A.S. would have never started legal proceedings against us,

119


-----

but for its financial distress, because Klarius S.A.S. was declared bankrupt on March 26, 2008, and
winding-up proceedings commenced in September 19, 2008. The Chartres Commercial Court,
however, rejected our argument on June 5, 2012, and found that Klarius S.A.S. had a valid claim.
This proceeding is still pending. Klarius S.A.S. is claiming €2.4 million in damages. We dispute the
merits of this claim and no provision in respect thereof has been created in our financial accounts
as of August 31, 2016.

120


-----

# Regulation

We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Some of the most pertinent to the
business sector in which we operate are laws and regulations that pertain to the light vehicle and
truck wholesale sector and light vehicle inspections. The paragraphs below briefly describe some
of that laws and regulations (focusing on French and EU laws and regulations). This section does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the laws and regulations to which we are
subject and that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes.

### European Union

The sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts’ wholesale and repair and maintenance services
are currently regulated in the European Union by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”),
which replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) in 2010. Unlike BER 2002, the
New BER does not apply to the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which are covered
by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly, the material scope of the New BER is now limited to the
distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services for motor
vehicles.

The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the
Application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical
agreements and concerted practices (the “General BER”)) and the corresponding EU Guidelines
on Vertical Restraints.

These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that
original and equivalent spare parts competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred
to as “passenger cars” under the New BER) and trucks (referred to as “commercial vehicles”
under the New BER) manufacturers have full access to the market.

Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck
spare parts and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of Article 101
(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which prohibits
anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, if they comply with the provisions of both:

  - the General BER, which only applies if:

    - both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and

    - the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General
BER; and

  - the New BER, which implies that:

   - no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a
selective distribution system under which a member of the network is prohibited from
selling goods or services to independent garages;

    - no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts to freely sell such goods to
independent or authorized distributors, garages or end-users; and

    - no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of
motor vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and
easily on the components supplied or on spare parts.

Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the New BER
are not applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints cover more than
50% of a relevant market.

The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts that do not fulfill the
conditions of the General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the European
Commission, is likely to be the case for most agreements) may nonetheless benefit from an
individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in Article 101(3) of the TFEU.

121


-----

In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (European Commission’s Supplementary
Guidelines on Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair of Vehicles and for the
Distribution of Replacement Parts for Vehicles) (“notice 2010/C 138/05”), which provides some
guidelines on the application and interpretation of the New BER, further specifies that it is very
doubtful that selective distribution agreements that would contain any of the two following
restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3) of the TFEU:

  - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including
independent repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair
equipment or tools, publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside
assistance operators, operators offering inspection and testing services, and operators
offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to the brand-specific technical
information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded motor vehicles
in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and

  - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its
authorized network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or
extended warranty may not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for
the end-user to have the repair and maintenance services not covered by the warranty
exclusively performed by a member of the network or (ii) on the obligation for the enduser to use spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of replacements not
covered by the warranty.

The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services
marketed by independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of
alternative suppliers, thereby fostering competition between such articles (known as
“equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s trademark.

As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also
aims to protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby
ensuring that competing brands of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and
authorized repairers, as well as to parts wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that
the availability of such spare parts entails significant advantages for consumers especially since
there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the manufacturer and alternative
parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts bearing the
manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment
suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the
same notice, the European Commission specifies that in order to be considered to be of
“equivalent quality,” spare parts must be “of a sufficiently high quality that their use does not
endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that employs them. The European
Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the requirements for being
considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer.

In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable.
Accordingly, the French courts and the French Competition Authority assess vertical agreements
entered into in the sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and
maintenance services in light of these regulations and of the corresponding guidelines.

_Inspection_

European light vehicle inspections are currently regulated by the Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council of Europe dated as of May 6, 2009 (“Directive 2009/40/EC”), as
amended, providing for periodic technical inspections of each vehicle matriculated in a Member
State.

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks
permitted to operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2009/40/EC requires inspections to be made (i) four
years after the first utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles
with more than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than 3.5
tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be performed within one year from the first
utilization and every year thereafter.

122


-----

In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2009/40/EC have been provided for in the
French Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties can
be imposed and may be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that were
suspended as a result of the inspection and may also entail the impoundment of the vehicle or
the confiscation of the vehicle registration certificate (Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French
Highway Code).

_Protection of design and models for “visible” parts_

In the absence of EU harmonization, each Member State remains free to govern the legal
protection of designs and models for “visible” parts. In France, according to the French
Intellectual Property Code, the distribution of “visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and
windscreens) is protected by industrial design rights. Consequently, only the manufacturer has
the right to distribute these parts to various repairers. However, it must be noted that the French
Competition Authority has recently recommended the gradual removal of the restriction on the
distribution of “visible” spare parts destined for repairs.

# Management

### The Issuer

The Issuer is a private limited liability company (société anonyme) organized and existing under
the laws of France with registered number 086 380 706 RCS Créteil, having its registered office at
22 avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France. The board of directors of the Issuer currently
consists of 13 directors (administrateurs) and the business address of the directors is the same as

# Description of certain financing arrangements

### Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

**_Overview and structure_**

On November 12, 2015, LuxCo 5 and LuxCo 6 entered into a Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
among, inter alios, the Issuer (upon its accession on December 8, 2015), J.P. Morgan Limited,
Credit Suisse International and BNP Paribas S.A. as Arrangers, the financial institutions named
therein as original lenders, the institution named therein as Agent and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited
as Security Agent (each as defined therein), which was amended on October 3, 2016 (the
“Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”). Borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility
have been increased to an aggregate principal amount of €50.0 million on a committed basis as
of October 26, 2016.

The committed facility made available under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the
“Revolving Credit Facility”) may be utilized by any current or future Borrower under the
Revolving Credit Facility in euro, pounds sterling and U.S. dollars and any other currency
approved by the lenders by the drawing of cash advances, the issuance of bank guarantees and
letters of credit and by way of ancillary facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, amounts may be
borrowed, repaid and reborrowed at any time. Borrowings will be available for the general
corporate and working capital purposes of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and, without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, for capital expenditure, acquisitions and investments not prohibited under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Total Commitments under and as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may be increased at any time up to an amount which,
together with any other credit facilities or debt securities ranking pari passu with the Revolving
Credit Facility in right of payment and right to receive proceeds from an enforcement of the
Collateral, would not exceed the basket for such permitted credit facilities or debt securities
under the Indenture, including by way of (i) an increase in the total commitments in respect of
the Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) the inclusion and making available of commitments in respect
of one or more additional facilities.

**_Availability_**

The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent,
be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the Termination Date (as defined below) of
the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantor are each a Borrower and Guarantor under and as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by
the Issuer and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined therein), the Guarantors. A
mechanism is included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to enable any of the Issuer’s
Restricted Subsidiaries in France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and any other agreed jurisdiction
to accede as an Additional Borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain
conditions.

**_Maturity and repayment requirements_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on December 8, 2020 (the “Termination Date”).

Each utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such
date. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or
prior to the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum equal
to the aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR or LIBOR (as applicable, subject to a 0%
floor). The margin under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be 3.50% per annum for the first

129


-----

twelve months of its term. From the date falling twelve months from December 8, 2015 (the
“Closing Date”), and subject to certain conditions, the margin on utilizations of the Revolving
Credit Facility will be subject to a ratchet as follows:

**Margin**
**Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio:** **(percent per annum)**

Greater than 3.50:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%
Equal to or less than 3.50:1 but greater than 3.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.25%
Equal to or less than 3.00:1 but greater than 2.50:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.00%
Equal to or less than 2.50:1 but greater than 2.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.75%
Equal to or less than 2.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50%

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility from (and including) the Closing Date to (and including) the last day of
the availability period for the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is payable quarterly
in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the Revolving Credit Facility and on the
date the Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which a lender cancels its
commitment.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Facility Agent”) and the Security Agent in connection
with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and fronting
fees to the issuing bank under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and letter of credit fees to
the Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an amount equal to the
then applicable margin of the Revolving Credit Facility (and (if applicable) an additional facility
loan) with respect to an issuance of letters of credit (subject to certain conditions and exclusions).

**_Guarantees_**

Each Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement has provided a senior secured
guarantee of all amounts payable to the finance parties by each other obligor (including any
additional borrowers that accede to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (subject to the
limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests”)._

**_Security_**

The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the Collateral. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility
may from time to time benefit from certain guarantees and security, in addition to the Collateral,
which do not guarantee or secure the Notes.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of security in
respect the Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes) will be required to
be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to
the Notes.

**_Representations and warranties_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain certain customary representations and
warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications,
exceptions and baskets, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated,
including in respect of: (i) status; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) no conflict; (iv) power and

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain certain of the same incurrence covenants
and related definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Notes. In addition, the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will also contain certain affirmative and negative covenants
and a financial covenant. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are
subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and
baskets.

**_Notes purchase condition_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides that the Issuer may prepay/redeem/repurchase/
defease/otherwise retire for value any Existing Senior Secured Notes and Senior HoldCo Pay-IfYou-Can Notes prior to their scheduled maturity (a “Note Purchase”) without any obligation to
make any pro rata prepayment of the Revolving Facility commitments where such redemption or
repurchase is (a) made: (i) following a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and as further described in “—Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a
_change of control or a sale” below), provided that the obligations under the Revolving Credit_
Facility Agreement in respect of a Change of Control are complied with; (ii) from the proceeds of
any indebtedness that refinances any Existing Senior Secured Notes or Senior HoldCo Pay-If-YouCan Notes that complies with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement; or (iii) from
the proceeds of new equity subscriptions, debt subordinated to the Revolving Credit Facility in
right of payment, amounts available to be distributed to the Parent Guarantor in accordance
with the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, Intercreditor Agreement, Indenture, Existing Senior
Secured Notes and Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes; or (b) in an amount not exceeding 50%
of the aggregate amount in existence and uncancelled on the Closing Date of: the aggregate
face value of the Existing Senior Secured Notes; and the aggregate face value of any Senior
HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes; over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding for these
purposes (i) any fees, make-whole payments, call premiums and other amounts not constituting
principal with respect to such Note Purchase and (ii) proceeds of any indebtedness that refinances
any Existing Senior Secured Notes or Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes) (the “Note Purchase
Basket”).

Where the Issuer makes Note Purchases in excess of the Note Purchase Basket (an “Excess
Redemption”) and which are not otherwise made in accordance with paragraph (a) above, the
total Revolving Credit Facility commitments shall be cancelled, and if applicable, prepaid in the
same proportion until the total Revolving Credit Facility Commitments have been reduced to not
more than €20,000,000.

**_Additional covenants_**

The additional covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information,
including annual audited and quarterly financial statements, compliance certificates and an
annual budget and, upon request, certain information relating to the financial condition of the
Group (as defined in the Indenture) and/or any member of the Group; (ii) authorizations;
(iii) compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) anti-corruption and sanctions; (v) the maintenance
of the Percentage Test (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement); (vi) further
assurance; (vii) no change of COMI; and (viii) certain conditions subsequent, in each case subject
to exceptions and materiality thresholds.

**_Covenant suspension_**

The provision for suspension of certain covenants upon the Notes achieving investment-grade
status as set forth in the “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” shall also apply equally to the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of control or a sale_**

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which includes
the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and,
subject to certain conditions, an Adverse Corporate Decision (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement)) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Revolving
Credit Facility Lenders”) shall not be obligated to fund utilizations (other than

131


-----

rollover utilizations), and if a Revolving Credit Facility Lender requests and gives notice to the
Revolving Credit Facility Agent, within 30 days of receiving notice of such Change of Control, that
its commitments shall be cancelled and that it requires payment of all of its share of the
outstanding utilizations and all other amounts owing to it, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent
shall promptly notify the Issuer that such Revolving Credit Facility Lender shall be required to be
prepaid or replaced and its commitments cancelled in full on the date falling 30 days after such
Revolving Credit Facility Lender has given notice to the Revolving Credit Facility Agent.

**_Financial covenant_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we will be required to test the drawn super
senior leverage covenant, being the ratio of drawn super senior net debt under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement to consolidated pro forma EBITDA, of 0.7:1 (the “Drawn Super Senior
Leverage Covenant”) if, on any Test Date (commencing on the first Test Date to occur after two
full Test Periods have elapsed after the Closing Date), the Test Condition has been met. The
financial covenant is calculated and tested quarterly, provided that exceeding the Drawn Super
Senior Leverage Covenant on any Test Date should only result in a drawstop under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and shall not constitute or result in a default or an event of default
and shall not operate as a drawstop in respect of any rollover loans or other rollover utilizations).

To the extent that the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant has been exceeded on a Test Date,
subject to certain limitations as more fully detailed in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
the Issuer may cure that covenant (i) automatically where the Drawn Super Senior Leverage
Covenant is not exceeded on the following Test Date or the Test Condition is not met on the
following Test Date or (ii) through the receipt of new shareholder injections and/or subordinated
shareholders loans by the date falling no later than 20 business days after the date that the
quarterly financial statements for that relevant period were due to be delivered, in an amount
sufficient to, subject to certain limitations and at the election of the Issuer, ensure such Drawn
Super Senior Leverage Covenant would have been met had the proceeds from such new
shareholder injection or subordinated shareholder loan been applied (A) towards consolidated
pro forma EBITDA or (B) in reduction of drawn super senior net debt immediately prior to the
end of the relevant period.

“Relevant Period” means each period of twelve months ending on or about the last day of each
Test Date.

“Test Condition” means, on any Test Date, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans under
the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of the Revolving Credit Facility by way of
letters of credit (or bank guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any
OID) on the last day of the Relevant Period exceeds 35% of the total Revolving Credit Facility
commitments as of such date or if higher, the total Revolving Credit Facility commitments as at
the date of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

“Test Date” means each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

“Test Period” means the period commencing on the day immediately following a Test Date and
ending on the next occurring Test Date.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain
adjustments as necessary) as under the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which
are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions,
baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) misrepresentation; (ii) unlawfulness
and invalidity; (iii) breach of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (iv) the repudiation and rescission
of finance documents.

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in
connection with it are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law
although the restrictive covenants certain information undertakings and certain events of

132


-----

default, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, are interpreted in
accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by, English law).

The Issuer, the direct shareholder of the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of
the Issuer have entered into an Intercreditor Agreement dated January 31, 2014, to govern the
relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(ii) any persons who accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging
agreements (collectively, the “Hedging Agreements”; the liabilities under such Hedging
Agreements, the “Hedging Liabilities”; and any persons that accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as counterparties to such Hedging Agreements being referred to in such capacity as
the “Hedge Counterparties”); (iii) the Trustee, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of
the Notes (for the purpose of this “Description of certain financing arrangements,” the “Notes”)
(the “Noteholders”) (the “Notes Trustee”); (iv) certain intragroup creditors and debtors;
(v) certain direct or indirect shareholders of the Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that
the Issuer or another member of the Group has incurred or may incur in the future (including any
subordinated shareholder loans); and (vi) other lenders and creditors.

   - In this description, “Group” refers to the Issuer and each of its subsidiaries.

  - Each member of the Group that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the
Revolving Credit Facility, in respect of the Notes or under any other Debt Document (as
defined in “—Further security and incremental borrowings”) is referred to as a “Debtor”
and are collectively referred to as the “Debtors.”

The Intercreditor Agreement will set forth:

  - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

  - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence
of certain insolvency events;

  - turnover provisions; and

  - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to
transaction security (such assets, the “Collateral”; such security, the “Transaction Security”;
and the documents constituting such Transaction Security, the “Transaction Security
Documents”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to indebtedness that may be
incurred by the members of the Group, which is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit
Facility Documents (as defined below), the Notes Documents (as defined below), any Pari Passu
Debt Document (as defined below) and any Senior Unsecured Notes Document (as defined
below) to rank pari passu in right of payment with the liabilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the liabilities under the Indenture (for the purposes of this section, the
“Notes Liabilities” and any existing Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below), then existing and to
be secured on the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such
indebtedness (excluding, for the purposes of this section, any Notes Liabilities) being the “Pari
Passu Debt”; the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Creditors”; the
liabilities of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Liabilities”; and
the documents creating or evidencing the Pari Passu Liabilities, the “Pari Passu Debt
Documents”).

133


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement will also include provisions relating to indebtedness in the form of
senior unsecured notes (such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes,” the liabilities of the
Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities” and
documents creating or evidencing the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, the “Senior Unsecured
Notes Documents”) that may be incurred by a special purpose entity which is wholly-owned
directly or indirectly by LuxCo 5 (other than the Issuer) and is neither a member of the Group nor
a subsidiary of the Issuer (such entity, the “Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer”) and provisions
relating to the liabilities in respect of guarantees granted by each guarantor of the Senior
Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities”), that is permitted or not
prohibited under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu
Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured Note Document to rank equally with any
existing Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for any credit facility constituting a “Credit
Facility” under the Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the
Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured
Notes Document to receive priority in respect of the proceeds of the enforcement against the
Collateral (each such facility being a “Credit Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit
Facility, the “Credit Facilities” and each finance document relating thereto (but excluding any
Hedging Agreement), a “Credit Facility Document”). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a
“Credit Facility Lender” and excluding any Hedging Liabilities, the liabilities of the Debtors to the
Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the “Credit Facility Lender Liabilities.”

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict
between the terms of a Debt Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.

By purchasing a Note, Noteholders shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Notes Trustee and
the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted
payments described below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities; (ii) the liabilities of the
Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into in relation to interest rate hedging in
respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or any Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari
Passu Debt (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Credit Facility Lender
Liabilities and the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the Credit Facility Agent, the “Super
Senior Liabilities” and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities, the “Super Senior Creditors”);
(iii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into in relation to
foreign currency hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or the Senior Unsecured
Notes or (2) in respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and the
creditors of the Non-Super Hedging Liabilities, the “Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparties”); (iv)
the liabilities of the Issuer and the Debtors in respect of the Notes (the “Notes Liabilities”); (v) the
Pari Passu Liabilities (together with the Notes Liabilities and the Non- Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Liabilities,” and the creditors of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the
“Senior Secured Creditors”); (vi) the liabilities of the Issuer and the Debtors in respect of the Senior
Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities”) and (vii) certain other unsecured
liabilities, will rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

  - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities of any Debtor to an arranger under the
Revolving Credit Facility (the “Arranger Liabilities”), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the
liabilities owed to the Security Agent will rank pari passu and without any preference
between them; and

  - second, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities will rank pari passu and without
any preference between them.

134


-----

The intercompany obligations (the “Intra Group Liabilities” and the documents creating or
evidencing such Intra Group Liabilities being “Intra Group Debt Documents”) of any member of
the Group that is party to the Intercreditor Agreement in such capacity to any other member of
the Group (each an “Intra Group Lender” and collectively the “Intra Group Lenders”) which is
party to the Intercreditor in such capacity are postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed
by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors (as defined herein). The liabilities owed by any Debtor to
any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer (or any holding company or subsidiary of the
Issuer or any other subsidiary of any such holding company that is not a member of the Group)
and any of their respective transferees or successors (the “Shareholder Liabilities” and the
documents creating or evidencing such Shareholder Liabilities being “Shareholder Debt
Documents”) are postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the
Primary Creditors.

In this section the Shareholder Liabilities and the Intra Group Liabilities are together referred to
as the “Subordinated Liabilities.”

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the
Transaction Security ranks and secures the following liabilities (but only to the extent that such
security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

  - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities
will rank and secure such liabilities first, pari passu and without any preference between
them; and

  - second (to the extent only of any security granted in favor of the Security Agent over the
shares, loans, bonds or other equity or debt instruments issued by the Issuer to the Parent
Guarantor or by any holding company of the Parent Guarantor to the Senior Unsecured
Notes Issuer (the “SUN Shared Security”), the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities.

The Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities and the Subordinated Liabilities will not be secured by any
of the Transaction Security unless permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes
Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities shall be secured by the SUN Shared Security, if any. The Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities are senior obligations of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer. Until the
Senior Secured Debt Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors may not take any
steps to appropriate the assets of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in connection with any
enforcement action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all Proceeds from Enforcement of the Collateral and certain
other recoveries will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement
_of Transaction Security.”_

**_Further security and incremental borrowings_**

The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the
Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities owed to Creditor Representatives (as defined herein, other
than in paragraph (f) of that definition), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Arranger
Liabilities, together, the “Secured Liabilities,” and the creditors thereof, the “Secured Parties”
and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the “Secured Debt Documents”) may take,
accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities or
other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities,
provided that, if and to the extent legally possible, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is also granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other
Secured Parties. Any such additional security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above and the proceeds of the
enforcement of any such security will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds
_from Enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement will contemplate the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring
incremental borrowing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing the
borrowing liabilities incurred under the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or
in respect of any Credit Facility, the Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities,
the Pari Passu Debt or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments together with
Transaction Security Documents, the Shareholder Debt Documents and the Intra Group Debt

135


-----

Documents being referred to collectively as the “Debt Documents”) and/or incurring guarantee
liabilities in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing (such
incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred
to as “Additional Indebtedness”) which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with
and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank
behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing
liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the
“Subordinated Creditors” and, collectively with the Secured Parties and the Senior Unsecured
Notes Creditors, the “Creditors” and each a “Creditor”) will confirm in the Intercreditor
Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is
permitted or not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors’
cost) enter into such documentation as may be necessary (including entering into a new
intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to
ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the Debtors in
respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does
not in any significant respect have a material adverse effect on the interests of any of the
Secured Parties.

**_Security: Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors_**

The Pari Passu Creditors and Notes Creditors may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) security in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities and Notes Liabilities in addition to the
Transaction Security if, at the same time, it is also granted either:

(i) to the Security Agent as trustee for the other Secured Parties in respect of their
secured obligations;

(ii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in
favor of the Security Agent as trustee for the Secured Parties:

A. to the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations; or

B. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure for the benefit of the other
Secured Parties; or

(iii) in the case of any security granted after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement,
to some of the Secured Parties provided that such security is incremental to the
Transaction Security that has already been granted in favor of all other Secured
Parties and any proceeds derived from the enforcement of such security will be
shared with the Secured Parties in accordance with the payment waterfalls set
forth in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security.”

and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and Priority”; and

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Pari Passu
Liabilities in addition to those in:

(i) the original form of the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the documents or
instruments creating or evidencing the Notes Liabilities (the “Notes Documents”);

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given for the benefit of
all the Secured Parties in respect of their Secured Liabilities;

only if, in each case (1) the grant of such security or the giving of such guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss is permitted by the Credit Facility Documents and (2) at the same
time, it is also granted to the Credit Facility Lenders and granted to the other Secured Parties in
respect of their respective Secured Liabilities and ranks in the same order of priority as that
contemplated in “—Ranking and priority.”

136


-----

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will permit, prior to the occurrence of an acceleration event in
respect of a Credit Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Notes Liabilities (a “Secured Debt
Acceleration Event”), payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Notes Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, in each case, in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Credit Facility Agreement, the Notes Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents,
but subject to, in the case of payments in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities and Notes Liabilities,
any restrictions under the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents and any Pari Passu
Debt Documents then outstanding. Following the occurrence of a Secured Debt Acceleration
Event, subject to certain exceptions, payments can only be made by the Debtors applying the
amounts received by the relevant Debtor under the process described under “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security.” The restriction in the foregoing sentence_
shall not apply (i) where, provided that the Majority Super Senior Creditors constitute the
Instructing Group in accordance with “—Enforcement decision,” a payment block suspension
notice has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent to the Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) to the extent that such Secured Debt
Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by
each relevant Creditor Representative.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments in respect of Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantee Liabilities prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date (as defined below) to be made by
the Debtors under the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents including if (a) (i) the payment is of
any principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer Liabilities which is either not prohibited from being paid by the Credit Facility, the Notes
Document and any Pari Passu Debt Document or is paid on or after the final maturity date of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is a date not earlier than one
year after the Termination Date at the time of issuance of such Senior Unsecured Notes) or is a
payment of any amount that is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest or a
corresponding amount under the relevant proceeds loan for the Senior Unsecured Notes (such
amount including all scheduled interest payments, including if applicable, special interest or
liquidated damages) and default interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities accrued due
and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Debt Document, additional
amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant indenture for the Senior
Unsecured Notes and/or applicable proceeds loan, (ii) no notice of a Secured Debt Event of
Default (as defined herein) has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or
the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as the case may be); and (iii) no payment default under any
Credit Facility, the Notes Indenture (above an agreed threshold) and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents (above an agreed threshold) has occurred and is continuing; (b) the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (as defined herein) and the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative
give prior consent to that payment being made; (c) the payment is of amounts owing to the
Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts”); (d) the
payment is of administrative and maintenance costs, fees, expenses and taxes of the Issuer (in
acting as the issuer of the Senior Unsecured Notes) including any reporting or listing
requirements, as permitted under the terms of the Credit Facilities; or (e) the payment is of costs,
commissions, taxes, premiums and any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental
to) any refinancing of the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents in compliance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facilities, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt
Documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments to be made from time to time when due
to lenders owed any Intra Group Liabilities (“Intra Group Liabilities Payments”) if at the time of
payment no Secured Debt Acceleration Event or an acceleration event in respect of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities has occurred and is continuing (an “Acceleration Event”). The
Intercreditor Agreement will permit Intra Group Liabilities Payments if (i) an Acceleration Event
has occurred prior to the date on which the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in full (the
“Super Senior Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Instructing Group (as defined, and
further described, in “—Enforcement decision”); (ii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the
Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Secured Liabilities are

137


-----

discharged in full (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iii) an Acceleration Event has
occurred after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the later of the date on which the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are discharged (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date”),
with the consent of the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (as defined herein) (acting
through their Creditor Representatives); (iv) that payment is made to facilitate payment of the
Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities; or (v) to the extent a Secured Debt
Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in writing by
each relevant Creditor Representative, the payment is made to facilitate payments of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities that are permitted to be paid under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and, if such payment is made pursuant to Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees, it
would be permitted at such time. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, each Debtor may
convert its Intra Group Liabilities into equity.

Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment is
not prohibited by a Credit Facility, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the
Senior Unsecured Notes Documents; (ii) the payment is to be made to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer in respect of any Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities made in order to make a
corresponding payment in Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities which is then due and payable by the
Senior Unsecured Issuer pursuant to the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents (or in the case of a
payment in respect of scheduled interest, such payment will become due and payable within three
business days) to be made at the time such payment of Shareholder Liabilities is made to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Issuer; (iii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (as
defined below) gives written consent to such payment being made; (iv) on or after the Super Senior
Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to
such payment being made; or (v) after the Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to Senior
Unsecured Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (acting through their
Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment being made. At
any time prior to an Acceleration Event, Shareholder Liabilities may be converted into equity.

**_Creditor Representative_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties will appoint various creditor representatives.
“Creditor Representative” means:

(a) in relation to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, the facility agent under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement;

(b) in relation to the Credit Facility Lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility
agent in respect of that credit facility (an “Additional Credit Facility Agent,” and,
together with the facility agent under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, a
“Credit Facility Agent”);

(c) in relation to the Noteholders, the Notes Trustee;

(d) in relation to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders, the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(e) in relation to any Pari Passu Creditors, the creditor representative for those Pari Passu
Creditors (the “Pari Passu Debt Representative”); and

(f) in relation to any Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty (which shall be its
own Creditor Representative).

**_Issue of Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice_**

(a) Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge
Date (the “Secured Debt Discharge Date”), except with the prior consent of the Credit
Facility Agent, the consent of the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s), and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement which
will deal with the effects of an insolvency event, the Issuer shall ensure that no
member of the Group shall make, and no Senior Unsecured Noteholder may receive
from any member of the Group, any payment in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes
which would otherwise be permitted as referred to above (other than the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee Amount) if:

138


-----

(i) a payment default under the Secured Debt Documents (a “Secured Debt Payment
Default”) has occurred and is continuing; or

(ii) an event of default under a Credit Facility Document, the Notes Documents or
the Pari Passu Debt Documents (other than a Secured Debt Payment Default) (a
“Secured Debt Event of Default”) has occurred and is continuing, from the date
on which the Credit Facility Agent or the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative (as the case may be) (the “Relevant Representative”) delivers a
notice (a “Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to that Secured Debt Event of Default to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee, until the earliest of:

A. the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

B. the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default occurs for failure to pay principal
at the original scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes;

C. in relation to payments of Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, if a Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period (as defined below) is in effect at any time after delivery of that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that Senior Unsecured Standstill
Period expires;

D. the date on which the relevant Secured Debt Event of Default is no longer continuing
and, if the relevant Secured Liabilities have been accelerated, such acceleration has
been rescinded;

E. the date on which the Relevant Representative delivers a notice to the Senior
Unsecured Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee
cancelling the Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice;

F. the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date;
and

G. the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee takes any enforcement action
that it is permitted to take under the Intercreditor Agreement.

(b) Unless the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee waives this requirement:

(i) a new Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and
until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice; and

(ii) no Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a
Secured Debt Event of Default more than 60 days after the date the Credit
Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt Representative (as
applicable) received notice of that Secured Debt Event of Default.

(c) The Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s)
may serve only one Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances but this shall not, subject to paragraph (b) above, affect
the right of the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) to issue a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice in respect of any
other event or set of circumstances.

(d) The Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s)
may not serve a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice with respect to a Secured Debt
Event of Default that had been notified to each of them at the time at which an
earlier Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice was issued.

**_Cure of payment stop: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

If at any time following the issuance of a Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Secured Debt Payment Default:

(a) the Senior Unsecured Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or the
Secured Debt Payment Default ceases to be continuing, as the case may be; and

139


-----

(b) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders an
amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Senior Unsecured Notes
Documents and which would have been permitted payments but for that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Secured Debt Payment Default, then any Event of
Default that may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be
waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice (as defined below) that may
have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case
without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Unsecured
Noteholders.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement/certain challenges by Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

Until the Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by the
Instructing Group, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder shall take or require the taking of any
enforcement action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities except as
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes
_Guarantee enforcement” below._

**_Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement_**

(a) The above restrictions on enforcement will not apply if:

(i) an event of default (or event or circumstance which would, with the expiration
of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination
provided for in the relevant definition of “Event of Default” in the Senior
Unsecured Notes Indenture or any combination of the foregoing, be an event of
default) under any Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Unsecured Notes
Default”) (such default being a “Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default”) is
continuing;

(ii) the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes
Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior
Unsecured Notes Default from the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default is continuing at the end of the
relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period.

(b) Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Unsecured Notes Default, the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee may, by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in
writing notify the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) of the existence of such Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

**_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
shall mean the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the
Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Credit
Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) in respect of such
Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Secured Parties take any enforcement action (excluding any action taken
to preserve or perfect any Collateral as opposed to realizing it) in relation to a Senior
Unsecured Notes Guarantor, provided that the Senior Unsecured Noteholders may
then only take the same enforcement action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantor as the enforcement action taken by the Secured Parties against such Senior
Unsecured Notes Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an insolvency event in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor
against whom enforcement action is to be taken;

140


-----

(d) the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default occurs for failure to pay principal
at the original scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes; and

(e) the expiration of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date
such first Senior Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiration occurs
as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy).

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders may take enforcement action as described above in relation to
a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a
result of any other Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee that it is enforcing
Transaction Security created over (directly or indirectly) shares of a Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantor, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder may take any action referred to in “—Permitted
_Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement,”against that Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor_
while the Security Agent is, in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing Group, taking
steps to enforce that Collateral where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect
such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Enforcement instructions_**

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other
enforcement action unless otherwise instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as further
described in “—Enforcement decision” below).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Instructing Group may give instructions
to the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Transaction Security as they see fit provided
that the instructions as to enforcement given by the Instructing Group are consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles (as defined herein).

**_Enforcement decision_**

If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting
through their Creditor Representatives) (the “Instructing Group”) wish to instruct the Security
Agent to commence enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must
deliver a copy of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the “Proposed Enforcement
Instructions”) to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representative for each of the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate). The Security Agent shall promptly
notify each Creditor Representative of the Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Trustee and each of
the Pari Passu Representatives upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement Instructions.

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received any Proposed
Enforcement Instructions, then the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing
the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders (and the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders shall be the Instructing Group for the
purpose of “—Enforcement instructions” above, in each case, acting through their respective
Creditor Representative) provided that such instructions are consistent with certain Security
Enforcement Principles (as referred to below) and failure to give instructions will be deemed to
be an instruction not to take Enforcement steps.

In the event that:

(a) from the date that is three months after the date upon which the first Proposed
Enforcement Instructions (including such instructions not to take Enforcement steps)
are delivered, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders) has not taken any Enforcement Action of the Transaction Security;
or

(b) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of
the date upon which the first such Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including any
such instructions not to take Enforcement steps) are delivered,

then (with effect from the date of the earlier to occur of such events), the Majority Super Senior
Creditors shall become the Instructing Group for the purposes of “—Enforcement instructions”
above.

141


-----

If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the
Transaction Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become enforceable in
accordance with its terms, a Creditor Representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, as the case may be, may at any time
provide immediate instructions as to Enforcement to the Security Agent. If the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith (and notify the
Creditor Representatives of the other Super Senior Creditors and the Notes Creditors and the Pari
Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) the delay in taking Enforcement Action of the
Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

and the Security Agent shall act with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of
the determination pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, in accordance with the first such notice of
determination and instructions as to Enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in
each case that such instructions are consistent with certain Security Enforcement Principles
(referred to herein).

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor or Security Provider
(other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security
Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors
have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from such Majority
Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed
Enforcement Instructions from the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the
Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the Creditor
Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as the Creditor
Representative for the Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement instructions to the
Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such prior instructions
given by the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

Other than where the preceding two paragraphs apply, if, prior to the Super Senior Discharge
Date, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case,
acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a
manner that is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to herein), the
Creditor Representatives for the relevant Super Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors shall
give notice to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors and Senior
Secured Creditors (as appropriate), after which the Creditor Representatives for the other Super
Senior Creditors, the Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative shall consult with the
Security Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant Creditor
Representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that
such Creditors’ Representatives shall not be obligated to consult in the manner referred to in this
paragraph more than once in relation to each enforcement action.

After the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided by the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders.

142


-----

**_Limitation on enforcement of shareholder liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement
action in respect of such liabilities prior to the last to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date,
the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date (the “Final
Discharge Date”) save that, prior to the Final Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or member of the Group or grantor of Transaction
Security, each such Creditor may only (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless
the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that
Creditor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), and shall, if so directed by
the Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group
to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Shareholder Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that member of the Group in respect of any Shareholder Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any
Shareholder Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Shareholder
Liabilities owing to it,

but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Limitation on enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement
action in respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date except that, prior to the Final
Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the
Group or grantor of Transaction Security, each Intra Group Lender may only (unless otherwise
directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it
intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra Group Lender in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise
have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that Group member’s Intra Group Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that member of the Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra
Group Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the
Intra Group Liabilities owing to it, but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

A Creditor Representative may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with the
following security enforcement principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction
Security to achieve the security enforcement objective, such objective being to
maximize the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors
so far as such recovery is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value
from enforcement of the Transaction Security (the “Security Enforcement Objective”);

(b) without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will
be enforced and other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as
further described in “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction
_Security”); or_

143


-----

(ii) in the case of enforcement by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, sufficient
proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to
ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of
_Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in_
full in cash (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(c) to the extent that the Transaction Security that is the subject of the proposed
enforcement action is:

(i) securing assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate
book value of such assets exceeds EUR 1 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Instructing Group, and at the expense of the
Issuer, (to the extent that financial advisors have not adopted a general policy of not providing
such opinions) appoint an internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm or, if
it is not practicable for the Security Agent to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially
reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of interest) as determined by the Security
Agent (acting in good faith), another third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in
providing valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm
appointed as the relevant Debtor’s administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the
Security Agent (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the consideration received from
any disposal is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (a
“Financial Advisor’s Opinion”);

(d) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to
seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the
Intercreditor Agreement. Prior to making any appointment of a Financial Advisor, the
Security Agent is entitled to ensure that cost cover (at a level it is satisfied with, acting
reasonably) has been provided;

(e) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such
action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant
circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has
been met;

(f) where the Instructing Group is the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s Opinion
where sufficient Proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in
cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of
_Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full;_
and

(g) in the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is conducted by way of
Public Auction (as defined below), no Financial Advisor shall be required to be
appointed, and no Financial Advisor’s Opinion shall be required, in relation to such
enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
appoint a Financial Advisor to provide such advice as the Security Agent deems
appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of Public Auction.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt
Required Holders of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt and the Security Agent.

“Public Auction” means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of
the Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Transaction Security (or by a member of the
Group in circumstances that are a Distressed Disposal (as defined herein)), the process of such sale
or disposal having been conducted as follows:

(a) prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall, in respect of such auction
or other competitive sale process, consult with an internationally recognized
investment bank or accounting firm selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably)

144


-----

with respect to the procedures which may reasonably be expected to be used to
obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing market conditions (taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in order to facilitate a prompt and expeditious
sale at a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be
no obligation to postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);

(b) the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by law) in all
material respects the procedures recommended by such bank or firm in relation to
such auction or process;

(c) the Secured Parties shall have a right to participate; and

(d) HoldCo shall not have the right to participate without the consent of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties), the Notes Required
Holders and the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt if
such auction or competitive sale process is in respect of SUN Shared Security or assets
that were secured by such SUN Shared Security before foreclosure thereof.

For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above:

(i) the Security Agent shall be entitled to retain any such internationally recognized
investment bank or accounting firm as its and/or any of the other Secured
Parties’ financial advisor to advise and assist in the proposed sale or disposition
for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith determines is
appropriate for the circumstances;

(ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any
obligation to any person to engage in or to use reasonable efforts to engage in a
listing of any or all of any equity interests the subject of such auction or other
competitive sale process, including, without limitation, if recommended by such
investment bank or accounting firm; and

(iii) by reason of certain prohibitions, or exemptive or safe-harbor provisions from
suchprohibitions, contained in law or regulations of any applicable governmental
authority, the Security Agent may, with respect to any sale of all or any part of
such equity interests or assets:

A. limit purchasers to those who meet the requirements of such governmental authority
or exemptive or safe-harbor provision (as applicable) and/or make representations and
undertakings satisfactory to the Security Agent relating to compliance with such
requirements and/or provisions; and/or

B. limit purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things to acquire such shares
for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof;

(iv) the Security Agent and other Secured Parties shall not under any circumstances
be required to make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or
proposed purchaser (other than customary representations in a security
enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity interests pursuant to the
Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed
purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses; and

(v) without limitation to the other circumstances of the sale or other disposition that
the Security Agent and such investment bank or accounting firm may take into
consideration, the Security Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances
specify that no offer to purchase equity interest or other assets will be
entertained unless such offer:

A. is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests being sold or otherwise disposed;

B. is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any element of deferred compensation) and is not subject to any
financing conditions; and/or

145


-----

C. contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in not more
than three (3) months (or such longer period as the Security Agent may specify) from
the time of initiation of the sale or disposition process; and

(vi) a “right to participate”:

A. means any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a Secured Party makes shall be
considered by the Security Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm against
the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or
potential bidder. For the avoidance of doubt, if after having applied that same
criteria, the offer or indication of a potential offer made by a Secured Party is not
considered by the Security Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm to be
sufficient to continue in the sale or disposal process, such consideration being against
the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or
potential bidder (such continuation may include being invited to review additional
information or being invited to have an opportunity to make a subsequent or revised
offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise) then the right to participate
of that Secured Party under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to be
satisfied; and

B. shall not apply if the Security Agent believes in good faith that it may (or there is a
risk that it may) result in a violation of any applicable laws or that it may (or there is a
risk that it may) result in a requirement for registration under any applicable securities
laws.

For the purposes of paragraph (a) above, such investment bank or accounting firm may be
instructed by the Security Agent to take the limitations set out in subparagraphs (i) to (vi)
(inclusive) above into account and to formulate recommendations that are consistent with them.

**_Exercise of voting rights_**

Each Creditor (other than the Credit Facility Lenders, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, the
Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee) will
cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or
supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar
proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent and the
Security Agent shall give instructions for these purposes as directed by the Instructing Group,
provided that such instructions have been given in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by Primary Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any creditor in respect of the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Non-Super Senior Holding Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities
or the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (the “Primary Creditors”) receives or recovers the
proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security (whether before or after an insolvency
event) other than in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of
_proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security,” that Primary Creditor will, subject to certain_
exceptions:

(a) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold
that amount in trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which
receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(b) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly
pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or any

or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an insolvency event in
respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group), other than, in each case, any
amount received or recovered in accordance with the payment waterfall described in

(d) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
amount by way of set-off in respect of any of such liabilities after the occurrence of a

such liabilities that is not made in accordance with the payment waterfall described in
“—Application of proceeds from Enforcement of Transaction Security” below and
which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect
of that Debtor,

the relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or Subordinated Creditor (as applicable) will,

**_Release of the Guarantees and the security_**

_Non-distressed disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal of an asset of the Group which is subject to the Transaction
Security is not being effected (a) by enforcement of the Transaction Security; (b) at the request of
the Instructing Group, after the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (c) in the case of
a disposal to a person or persons outside the Group, after a Secured Debt Acceleration Event or a
Distress Event has occurred (each a “Distressed Disposal”) and is otherwise permitted by the
Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents (together the “Senior Debt Documents,” and such disposal, a “NonDistressed Disposal”), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is
authorized (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document
over the relevant asset; and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor,
to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the
assets of that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries, provided that if an
asset which is the subject of a Non-Distressed Disposal is transferred to another member of the
Group the release of the Transaction Security must be permitted under the terms of the Credit
Facilities, the Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents and, to the extent that

148


-----

replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the Debt
Documents, such Transaction Security will (subject to any other requirements relating to the
release, retaking, amendment or extension of the Transaction Security under the Debt
Documents) be granted at the same time as (or before) the relevant disposals are effected.

If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory
prepayment of any of the Secured Liabilities or to be offered to any Secured Party pursuant to
the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, then such proceeds will be applied in or towards
payment of such Secured Liabilities or shall be offered to the relevant Secured Parties in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Secured Debt Documents and the consent of any other
party will not be required for that application.

_Distressed Disposal_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the Security Agent is authorized: (a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the
capital of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor or any
subsidiary of that Debtor; (ii) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of
its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by
the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and
any trading or other liabilities it may have to an Intra Group Lender or another Debtor (“Other
Liabilities”); and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over the
relevant assets; and (b) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a holding
company of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that holding
company and any subsidiary of that holding company; (ii) that holding company and any subsidiary
of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt
Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its
liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt Documents and any Other Liabilities; and (iii) any
other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over the relevant assets.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the Security Agent is authorized:

(a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities of
that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company
under the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to a
Primary Creditor) or any liabilities owed by such Debtor, holding company or
subsidiary to another Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”):

(i) if the Security Agent does not intend that the relevant transferee will be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such
liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or all (but not part) of such Debtor
Liabilities; or

(ii) if the Security Agent does intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such
liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor and all or any part of such Debtor Liabilities
and any other liabilities under the Debt Documents, on behalf of the relevant
creditors and Debtors.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the Security Agent is authorized, if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in
the capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the
Security Agent decides to transfer to another Debtor all or any part of that Disposed Entity’s
obligations (or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity) in respect of Intra Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, to enter into any agreement to agree the transfer and acceptance
of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on
behalf of the Debtors that owe such liabilities and the Debtors to which such liabilities are to be
transferred.

149


-----

In the case of a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have an
obligation to postpone any Distressed Disposal or any disposal of Liabilities in order to achieve a
higher price).

If on or after the first date on which Senior Unsecured Notes are issued but before the Senior
Unsecured Notes Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior
Unsecured Notes Guarantees will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of
the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(ii) all present and future obligations owed to the Secured Parties under the Credit
Facility Documents, Hedging Agreements, the Notes Documents and the Pari
Passu Debt Documents by a member of the Group, all or part of whose shares are
pledged or charged in favor of the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such enforcement action, are unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not
assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the
Transaction Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed
of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently
with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim
(instead of a release or discharge):

A. the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative
determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the finance parties under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Note Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors (respectively)
will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged; and

B. the Credit Facility Agent, Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative serve a
notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same, in which case
the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such
purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser); and

(iii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

A. pursuant to a Public Auction; or

B. where a Financial Advisor confirms that the sale, disposal or transfer price is fair from
a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, although
there shall be no obligation to postpone any such sale, disposal or transfer in order to
achieve a higher price.

**_Amendment_**

In addition to customary minor, technical or administrative matter amendments by the Security
Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it may be amended with only the consent
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required
Holders, the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders, the Issuer and the Security Agent, unless
it is an amendment, waiver or consent that has the effect of changing or which relates to: (a) any
amendment to the order of priority or subordination set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (b)
any amendment to the payment waterfall, turnover provisions or enforcement provisions set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) certain provisions relating to the giving of instructions
to the Security Agent or the exercise of discretion by the Security Agent; or (d) the amendment

Secured Party, only agreement from the requisite affected class is required.

Subject to the paragraphs above and certain other exceptions, no amendment or waiver of the
Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the
rights of any party to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior written consent of the
affected party.

to it; the purchasing holders of Notes and Pari Passu Creditors (other than the Notes Trustee and
the Pari Passu Debt Representative) indemnify each Super Senior Creditor and Super Senior
Hedge Counterparty for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount
received by such Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge Counterparty; and the relevant
transfer shall be without recourse to, or warranty from, any Super Senior Creditor, save that each
Credit Facility Lender and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be deemed to have given the
following representations and warranties on the date of the transfer:

Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative (together, the “Relevant Representatives”),
require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but not part only) of the
rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquisition Debt”). If more than one Purchasing Senior Unsecured
Notes Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Senior Secured Acquisition Debt,
each such Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor shall acquire the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the
Senior Unsecured Notes Documents (“Senior Unsecured Credit Participations”) bears to the

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

### Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes

On November 12, 2015, HoldCo issued the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes. The Senior
HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are governed by New York law. The Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can
Notes will mature on November 15, 2020, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased and cancelled.
The Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes do not benefit from any Credit Support from the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuer or any of their subsidiaries.

Interest on the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are payable semi-annually in arrears on each
May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2016. The first interest payment
on the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes was, and the last interest payment on the Senior
HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes will be, made in cash. For each other interest payment, HoldCo will
be required to pay interest on the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes entirely in cash, unless
certain conditions described in the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes offering memorandum
are satisfied, in which case HoldCo will be entitled to pay, to the extent described therein,
interest for such interest period by increasing the principal amount of the Senior HoldCo Pay-IfYou-Can Notes or by issuing Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes in a principal amount equal to
such interest. Interest payable on the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes accrues at a rate equal
to 9.00% per annum for interest paid in cash and 9.75% per annum for interest paid in kind and
capitalized yearly based on a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

154


-----

The Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are senior obligations of HoldCo and structurally
subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the subsidiaries of HoldCo, including the
Notes issued hereby, borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, trade payables
and lease obligations.

The Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are secured by way of first-priority pledges over: (i) the
capital stock of HoldCo; (ii) the PECs owed by HoldCo; and (iii) the bank account of HoldCo. The
Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are not guaranteed.

The indenture governing the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes contains covenants for the
benefit of the holders of the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes that, among other things, limit
the ability of HoldCo and its restricted subsidiaries, including, among others, the Issuer, to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

  - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

  - make certain other restricted payments;

   - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

  - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

  - impose restrictions on the ability of HoldCo’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to HoldCo;

   - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

  - merge or consolidate with other entities;

  - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

  - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-YouCan Notes.

These limitations are, however, subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. If the
Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s
and Moody’s and no default has occurred and is continuing, certain covenants, including those
governing the incurrence of debt and the limitation on restricted payments, will be suspended.

In connection with the issuance of the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes, HoldCo entered into
an intercreditor agreement dated as of November 12, 2015, with, inter alios, the parent company
of HoldCo, the Security Agent and the Trustee, to govern the relationships and relative priorities
among HoldCo and some of its creditors, including the holders of the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-YouCan Notes and HoldCo’s shareholders.

of its Subsidiaries, and references to the “Sponsor SPVs” refer only to Luxco 6 and Luxco 5.

The Issuer will issue €510.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes,
consisting of € million aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Fixed
Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes”) and € million aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022 (the “Senior Secured Floating
_Rate Notes” and together with the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes, the “Senior Secured Notes”),_
under an indenture to be dated as of, 2016 (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the
Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Sponsor SPVs, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such
capacity the “Trustee”), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (in such capacity, the
“Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include terms of, or be subject to any of
the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Unless the context otherwise
requires, the term “Senior Secured Notes” also refers to “book entry interests” in the Senior
Secured Notes, as defined herein. The Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Collateral as
described under “—Security.”

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the Offering to (i) fund the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Redemption; (ii) fund the Senior HoldCo Pay-If-You-Can Notes Redemption; (iii) repay all
amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility; and (iv) pay the fees and expenses Incurred in
connection with the Refinancing.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, and we may issue an unlimited
principal amount of additional Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured
_Fixed Rate Notes”) and additional Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Senior_
_Secured Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Additional Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes,_

covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described

_Limitation on Liens”)._

Each of the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured Fixed
Rate Notes) and Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes) will constitute a separate series of Senior Secured Notes, but shall be treated
as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment,
waiver or other modification of the Indenture or any other action by the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes hereunder, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture; provided that, if the
Additional Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or the Additional Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes,
as applicable, are not fungible with the original Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or the original
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such

applicable, will be issued under a separate identification number. Unless the context otherwise
requires, in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured
_Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are_

Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness
and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for

undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations,
release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the
Security Agent. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”
for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this

request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not
been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions.

### General

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the
obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future Hedging
Obligations (if any);

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain future Hedging Obligations (if any), secured by property and assets that do not

  - be Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors;

Facility;

  - mature on, 2022; and

  - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in
certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-entry,
_delivery and form”)._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all
indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes. The
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority
obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank
senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations (if any).

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes will be
Guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Parent Guarantor and the Additional Guarantor (each, a
“Guarantor” and each such Guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”). In addition, if required by the
covenant described under “—Certain _covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees,”_ certain other
Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

158


-----

The Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

  - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including
such Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future
Hedging Obligations, if any);

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such
Guarantor, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and future Hedging
Obligations (if any) that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of such property and assets; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations
to trade creditors, of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, the Notes Guarantee
of the Additional Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the
amount of the existing proceeds loans, which is approximately €134 million and corresponds to
the aggregate of the existing proceeds loan of €54 million made available to on-lend the
proceeds of the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the existing proceeds loan of
€80 million made available to on-lend the amount drawn under the Bridge Facility, in each case,
to the Additional Guarantor. Other Indebtedness of the Guarantors may not be similarly limited.
See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial
_assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers_
_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security_
_interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors —Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—_
_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not_
_be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce_
_your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” The_
validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be
subject to the limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of
the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

As of August 31, 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Acquisition and the
Refinancing, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had €543.0 million of thirdparty borrowings, €510.0 million of which is represented by the Senior Secured Notes. In
addition, there would have been €50.0 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit
Facility.

### Principal and maturity

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €510.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes, consisting of € million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Fixed Rate Notes and € million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

159


-----

### Interest

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Senior Secured Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the
next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum.
Interest on the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on and of each year, commencing on, 2017. The Issuer will make each
interest payment to the holders of record on the and immediately preceding the
related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or,
if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**_Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the
“Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three month EURIBOR plus (ii)
%, as determined by the Calculation Agent. Interest on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and of each year,
commencing on, 2017. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of
record on,, and immediately preceding the related interest
payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance
or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days lapsed.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.

“Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest
rate payable on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes in respect of each interest period, which
shall initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m.
Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less
than 0%. If Reuters Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination
Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks
in the euro zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s
offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market
for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day
that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered
quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request
each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such
bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,
on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European
banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after
the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period

160


-----

will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than such rates are so provided then the rate
for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding
Interest Period.

“euro zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt
the euro as currency.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment
date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue
Date and end on and exclude, 2017.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page 248” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans European Automated Real Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of
interest payable on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest
Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the
Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Senior Secured Floating Rate Note outstanding
at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual
number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365. All percentages resulting from
any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a percentage point being rounded
upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The
determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In
no event will the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes be higher than the
maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

### Methods of receiving payments on the Senior Secured Notes

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined
below) will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the
Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the
address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured
Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior
_Secured Notes” below._

### Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in the City of
London. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch (the “Paying
_Agent”)._

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer
_Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent_
will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain
a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if
any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of
the Issuer.

161


-----

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Senior Secured
Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. For so long as Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent
or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

### Notes Guarantees

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment
obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be Guaranteed, jointly and severally, on the
Issue Date by the Guarantors.

The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to
certain guarantee limitations as set out therein.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2016, the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity
investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans) generated
17.4% of our consolidated revenue and 35.2% of our consolidated EBITDA and as of August 31,
2016 accounted for 56.4% of our consolidated total assets (excluding equity investment in
wholly-owned Subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans).

In addition, as described below under “—Certain covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the
Issuer that Guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other Indebtedness
permitted under the Indenture may also be required under the Indenture to enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions
or to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively
no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, under French corporate benefit rules, each
of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer and the amounts
recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the
proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to
refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or
any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the
date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. As a
consequence, in particular, the Guarantee of the Additional Guarantor is expected to be limited
in value to an amount not greater than the aggregate of the existing proceeds loan of
€54 million made available to on-lend the proceeds of the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured
Notes and the existing proceeds loan of €80 million made available to on-lend the amount drawn
under the Bridge Facility, in each case, to the Additional Guarantor. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and_
_other limitations on the Guarantors or the Luxembourg Security Providers may adversely affect_
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the_
_Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency_
_and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable to_
_creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under_
_the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” In addition, he validity and_
enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the
limitations described in “Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Issuer
depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries,

162


-----

including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and
minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any Guarantors) and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As at and for the twelve months
ended August 31, 2016, the total assets (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans), revenue and EBITDA of the non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries represented 82.6%, 64.8% and 43.6% of the consolidated revenue,
consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total assets of the Parent Guarantor, respectively, and,
after giving pro forma effect to the Doyen Acquisition and the Refinancing, the non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €23.4 million of Indebtedness. Although the Indenture
will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities
that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.
See “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

### Notes Guarantees release

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) will terminate and
release upon:

  - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of any Capital
Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company as a
result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

  - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

  - legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
_and discharge”;_

  - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

  - as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

  - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional Guarantees”; or_

  - with respect to a Guarantor that is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain covenants—
_Merger and consolidation—The Subsidiary Guarantors.”_

The Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor will terminate and be released upon the
circumstances described in the third, fourth and fifth bullet point set forth above and under “—
_Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Parent Guarantor.”_

Upon any occurrence giving rise to the release of a Notes Guarantee, as specified above, the
Trustee, subject to the receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture,
shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without any additional consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part
of the Trustee.

163


-----

### Transfer and exchange

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form
without interest coupons, as follows:

  - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
_Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and_
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

  - each series of Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

  - Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold
interests through such participants.

  - Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to
the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry
Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected
by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule
144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

No Book Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes (the
“Global Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes”), and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange
for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes (the “Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for any Book_
Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (the
“Global Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in
exchange for a Book Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (the
“Definitive Registered Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes”), and no Book Entry Interest in the
Global Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive Registered Senior Secured Floating
Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book Entry Interest in any Global Senior
Secured Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly,
from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

164


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging
Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register
the transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date;
or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled
to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

Immediately after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted_
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of
the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

### Security

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and
certain perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security
interests over:

(1) all issued Capital Stock of Luxco 6;

(2) all issued Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor;

(3) the Parent Guarantor’s material bank account and the Parent Guarantor’s material
intragroup receivables;

(4) all issued Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than certain de minimis shareholdings);

(5) certain assets of the Issuer, including the Capital Stock of the Additional Guarantor,
Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, the Issuer’s material bank
accounts and the Issuer’s material intragroup receivables;

165


-----

(6) the Capital Stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand
Ouest S.A.S. held by the Additional Guarantor;

(7) the Additional Guarantor’s material bank accounts; and

(8) the Additional Guarantor’s material intragroup receivables (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future Hedging
Obligations. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described
under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain covenants—
_Limitations on Liens,” the relevant security providers will be permitted to grant security over the_
Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, including Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after
certain super senior priority obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds
of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future Hedging Obligations.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on
behalf of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations
that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted
to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture
would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain insolvency law considerations and
_limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral,
the Issuer, the Guarantors, and the Sponsor SPVs, as the case may be, will have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and
dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will
be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash
dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting
from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions
(whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility as well as certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Senior Secured Notes and may
also secure certain future Indebtedness, certain of which is entitled to payment from the
proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Senior Secured Notes. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations
owed to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior
Secured Notes on the Issue Date. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to
be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness
_and the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.”_

166


-----

### Priority

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the
Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain future Hedging
Obligations, (c) the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture and
(d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral,
respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides,
among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future
Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by firstranking Security Interests; provided, however, that the Holders of Senior Secured Notes will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority
obligations have been paid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii)
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank senior
to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and
(iii) certain future Hedging Obligations. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional_
Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to
secure other Indebtedness, including Indebtedness that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior
Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral. See “—Release
_of Liens,” “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain definitions—_
_Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

### Security Documents

Under the Security Documents, the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant
security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture.
The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security
Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security
Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the
Trustee and the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security
Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, including France, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the
creation and perfection of security interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel
_debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and_
not the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt
construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk factors—
_Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The security over the Collateral is not granted_
_directly to the holders of the Notes.”_

Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall procure that each of their
respective Subsidiaries shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and
provide such assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering any Security
Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the
security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if
such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant
Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any
part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of
all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any
part of the Collateral. Each of the Sponsor SPVs, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall, and shall
procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such transfers,
conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its
nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.

The Indenture will also provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right

167


-----

to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Each
Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, appoints the Security Agent as its agent under the
Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the
Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Security Agent
will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in
accordance with the Indenture without requiring any consent of the Holders.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be
secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Sponsor’s SPV’s, the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries enter into
insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security
Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be
subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the Notes.”_

### Enforcement of Security Interest

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders and the
Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of
the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties
and certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes. These limitations are
described under “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar_
arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance
with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each
Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the
Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders of Senior
Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the
Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and
discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal
or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

### Intercreditor Agreement; Additional intercreditor agreements; agreement to be bound

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any
further consent of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of
_certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

168


-----

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting such
Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into
and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The
_security over the Collateral is not granted directly to the holders of the Notes” and “Description_
_of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Additional intercreditor agreements.”

### Release of Liens

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate_
the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and
_Subsidiary stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or (b) any_
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a
transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables
and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary)
unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a
Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal (and subject to the
Agreed Security Principles);

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms
of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured
Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) with respect to the Collateral granted by the Sponsor SPVs only, as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “Certain covenants—Maintenance of Double Luxco structure”;

(7) in respect of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV, upon a Change of Control (other than in
the context of an enforcement of Collateral granted by a Sponsor SPV not involving a
release in accordance with the next paragraph below); or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described
under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

169


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action requested
by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or the relevant Security Document, as
applicable. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it
to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely
solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance,
as described above, giving rise to a release of Liens has occurred, and that such release complies
with the Indenture.

Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes are not redeemable until, 2018 and the Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes are not redeemable until, 2017.

**_Calculation of the Applicable Premium_**

“Applicable Premium” means,

(x) with respect to any Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note the greater of:

(a) 1% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note; and

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of such
Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note at, 2018 (such redemption price
(expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the table above
under the first paragraph of the section entitled “—Optional Redemption—
_Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes” (excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), plus_
(2) all required interest payments due on such Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note to
and including, 2018 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed
upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at such
redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note; and

(y) with respect to any Senior Secured Floating Rate Note on any redemption date, the greater
of:

(a) 1% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Floating Rate Note; and

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of such
Senior Secured Floating Rate Note at, 2017 (such redemption price
(expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the table above
under “—Optional redemption—Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes” (excluding
accrued and unpaid interest)), plus (2) all required interest payments due on such
Senior Secured Floating Rate Note to and including, 2017 (excluding
accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a
discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis
points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Secured Floating Rate Note,

in each case, as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer
shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty
of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent or any Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of
direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant

171


-----

maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that have
become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior
to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any
publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board of Directors
or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the
redemption date to, 2018 with respect to the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes,
and, 2017 with respect to the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes; provided, however,
that if the period from the redemption date to, 2018 with respect to the Senior Secured
Fixed Rate Notes, and, 2017 with respect to the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, is
not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for
which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation
(calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the
period from such redemption date to, 2018 with respect to the Senior Secured Fixed
Rate Notes, and, 2017 with respect to the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, is less
than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal
Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used; provided further,
that in no case shall the Bund Rate be less than zero.

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall
be satisfied (provided, however, that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60
days from the date on which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes
at a price of at least 100.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes tendered,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable tender settlement
date, if Holders of Senior Secured Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of
the applicable outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior
Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer
in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer
expiration date, to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not
in part following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of
Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Senior Secured Notes.
Any such purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with
third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms
and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such Affiliate may
determine.

### General

We may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open
market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below. If the
optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name
the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to
redemption by the Issuer.

172


-----

### No sinking fund

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

### Redemption at maturity

On, 2022, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

### Selection and notice

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or
the Registrar will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case
of Senior Secured Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-entry, delivery and
_form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Paying_
Agent or the Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear
or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear for
communication to entitled account Holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. If and for so
long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such notice
to the Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the
Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes
outstanding.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates
to that Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed
in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on
such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date
interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called
for redemption.

### Redemption for taxation reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due and which will
become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below)
affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a

173


-----

holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax
_Law”),_

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law
must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date,
such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as
such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b)
mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under “—Selection and notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of
redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would
be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of
any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its
right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of internationally recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without
further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.

### Withholding taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee,
as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law.
If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on
behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is
made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder (or beneficial owner) in respect
of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or
withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have
been received by each Holder (or beneficial owner) in respect of such payments on any such

174


-----

Senior Secured Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the
existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure
by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a
reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner,
after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of
the Senior Secured Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the
applicable payment date or the date on which the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Notes been presented on
the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a
payment on the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment
by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid
such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting
payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(7) any Taxes imposed pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or
otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof, or any similar law or regulation implementing an
intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the
extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The
Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so

175


-----

deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax
receipts are not available, certified copies or other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon
as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to
the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or
any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in
such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or
future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or
similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance,
registration, initial resale, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior
Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured
Notes after this Offering and limited, solely to the extent of such Taxes or similar charges or
levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Senior Secured
Notes, to any such Taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1)
through (3) and (5) through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture,
any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction
in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such
Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

### Change of control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“—Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior
Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such
Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this
heading “—Change of control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally
exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived.

176


-----

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes
and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and all conditions
to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any
Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior
Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date
unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes
or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased
(including that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent
receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the
Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the
name of the Holder, the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes delivered for
purchase and proof of such delivery or holding, and a statement that such Holder is
withdrawing his election to have such Senior Secured Notes purchased); and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent) an
Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or
portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased
by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior
Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer,
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the

177


-----

unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of
any Change of Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior
Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to
require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a
transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in
place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that
constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under
the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under
such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of
such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not
_have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_
_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture, and_
_the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_
_protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

In addition, in the case of an event that constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of
“Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of
the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to
make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a

178


-----

degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
_substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a_
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described
above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes.

### Certain covenants

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such
Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro
_forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and (2) to the extent that the
Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.0 to 1.0; provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this
paragraph by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors will not exceed the greater of €20.0
million and 2.6% of Total Assets.

Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or
created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and

at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of €60.0 million and 75% of
Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness
permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(2)

Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of any joint
venture in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not
exceeding the greater of €15.0 million and 1.9% of Total Assets; or

the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the
obligee is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and if
the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such
Guarantor exceeds €10.0 million, to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the

179


-----

(4)


reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect
such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness) and except if in respect of intercompany
current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, it is
expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable
Notes Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be
deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not
permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be;

(a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any
Additional Senior Secured Notes) and any “parallel debt” obligations related to

or on-lending the proceeds of any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to the Indenture (including for the avoidance of doubt, Parent Senior
Notes) to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; provided, however,
that (i) any such Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded
for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and
clauses (1), (6), and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;


(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any

Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which (i) any
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) any assets are acquired and related liabilities are assumed
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, that, with respect to this clause
(5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro forma
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of
Indebtedness, (x) either (A) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other
transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness and (y) to the extent that
the Indebtedness Incurred under sub-clause (b) of this clause (5) constitutes Senior

(15) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness consisting of

million and 1.9% of Total Assets.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer,

182


-----

in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or
the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) (a) all Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant
that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral that is accorded super senior priority status
with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may not be reclassified, and (b)
all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall
be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant
and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant
and may not be reclassified;

(3) in any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any
provision of this covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant set forth in
“—Limitation on Liens” is or may be based on Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA,
the amount that may be Incurred and/or secured under such provisions shall be
deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace,
restructure, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant
to such provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant or secured
pursuant to the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens,” the maximum amount
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secured pursuant to this
covenant and/or the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens” shall not be deemed
to be exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the
result of fluctuations in the amount of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be
refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or
replacement, such excess will continue);

(4) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise
included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as
Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the second paragraph
above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case,
any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(7) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to
one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Indebtedness;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount
thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS; and

(9) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant, nor to be the
Incurrence of a Lien under the covenant set forth in “—Limitation on Liens”; provided

183


-----

that the Lien securing such originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was
secured in accordance with the Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness
outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any
Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and,
if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or
first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in
clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement
(with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted
Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on
substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with
different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the
application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured
or by virtue
of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

**_Limitation on restricted payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in

-----

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock) or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in

acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of
payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding (other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of
additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person (each such dividend, distribution,

(a) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately
thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer would have been permitted to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such
Restricted Payment; and

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments
made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including
Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5) and (17)(b) of the second
succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the
second succeeding paragraph) would not exceed the sum of (without duplication):

period) from the first day of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to
the AD Acquisition Completion Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter

consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available (or, in the case such
Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as
determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or

Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Issuer subsequent to

the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the Issuer
or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent
funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary subsequent to the AD Acquisition Completion Date of any
Indebtedness that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the
Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair
market value (as determined in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph)
of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange) but excluding (x)

Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) from the disposition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment
made after the AD Acquisition Completion Date;

(v) in the case of the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted

the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or the Unrestricted Subsidiary is merged or
consolidated into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of such amount

securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such
redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, excluding the amount

_Investment”; and_

(vi) 100% of any dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary after the AD Acquisition Completion Date from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividend or distribution does not reduce the
amount of Investments outstanding under clauses (11) or (18) of the definition of
“Permitted Investment,”

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option)
included in the foregoing clauses (iv), (v) or (vi). The fair market value of property or
assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair market
value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer.

186


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that
would otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments
pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1)
such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable
securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose of, or the
effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities was
to reduce the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer so that there would
be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved
without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3)
no Change of Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted
_Payments”):_

the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in
lieu of the issuance of fractional shares pursuant to clause (12) of this paragraph) for,

Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially
concurrent contribution to the equity (other than the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preference Shares or as an Excluded Contribution or Excluded Amount) of

property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause
(c)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant;

**_Limitation on Liens_**

any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial
_Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1)_
Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior
Secured Notes and all payments due under the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably
with, or prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness) the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in
the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes will be automatically and

which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

**_Limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or

or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its

the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or

190


-----

advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

Revolving Credit Facility), (b) the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents, or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in
each case in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness
Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Issuer, the Successor Issuer or the
Successor Subsidiary Guarantor (each as defined under “—Merger and consolidation”),
any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such
Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer or the Successor Subsidiary
Guarantor;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a
refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an

or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument

the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management of the Issuer) or (ii) customary in comparable
financings and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), the Issuer determines at the
time of Incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions would
not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted
under the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

191

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and

clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a
joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the
assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its
property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or

relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date
pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement_
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes or the Indenture, together with the
security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each
case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management of the Issuer) or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables

connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or a CICE Financing and that are
necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing or CICE Financing,
as applicable; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under
“—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or
other assets subject to such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in
respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

days of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

192


-----

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s or a
Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance
sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the
Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness and Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if
the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any Guarantee of
such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the
second paragraph of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received
from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the
extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the
applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or
such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at
any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €17.5 million and 2.2%
of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in sub-clauses (a) through (g) of this
clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash
Proceeds of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be
used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Indebtedness”;_ _provided,_ however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the
preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than
the Senior Secured Notes, Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the

_passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes (including Indebtedness with super priority_
status in respect of the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral) at a price of
no more than 100% of the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or
redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is
secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the
Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer
to Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions

193


-----

set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate
principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured
Notes);

(2) purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar
Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are
used or useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clauses
(1) through (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from
the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such
investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that
date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day, if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above has
been entered into after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €20.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10
Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an
offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any
Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than
the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and
other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount
of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the

194


-----

purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro
Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured
Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open
for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset_
Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”)
or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of
Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment
by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination
of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal
to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly
issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to
such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note
surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with
a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition offer
prior to the expiration of the 365-day (or 545-day, as applicable) period mentioned in this
covenant.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale,
lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer
(any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €7.5 million unless:

195


-----

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or
the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €15.0
million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been
approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

_Payments”) and any agreement related to such Restricted Payments or any Permitted_
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11)
and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options,
other equity-related investments or other securities, or other payments, awards or

program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or

approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto, or

indemnities and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,

the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Refinancing, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or

instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant
or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and
(iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement pursuant to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or

the ordinary course of business; provided that payments under such Tax Sharing
Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described
under clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax
liabilities of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

196


-----

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any
Affiliate of the Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar
entity, including any joint venture, that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such

and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;
_provided further that such Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or_
otherwise modified, will be deemed to be Subordinated Shareholder Funding for all
purposes under the indenture;

securities, and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such
transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders)
and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other holders of such class
generally.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the
following report:

_provided that the reports required in each of clause (1) and (2) above shall include in such report_
a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial statements of the
Parent Guarantor and the Issuer for any period after the Issue Date.

198


-----

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the
Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also
post such report on the Issuer’s website. The Issuer will also provide copies of all reports required
by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of
the Exchange so require, at the offices of the Listing Sponsor in Jersey.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the
date of such report or financial statement and on a consistent basis for the periods presented,
except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier
periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided below, no report need include
separate financial statements for the Issuer or any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with

quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the
last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “Reports” will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on
the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and
results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as
it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to

content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references to the Parent
Guarantor therein were references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated
financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent
or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris Stock Exchange) and
the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London
Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or
the Paris Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee
such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or such Parent or
IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such
Admission and Disclosure Standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the

requirements require the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports,
information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,
or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Paris
Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the Indenture.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
(the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and
the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the
Successor Issuer, as applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the
case of the Successor Issuer, such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement

200


-----

enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or
the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
“Merger and consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new
subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_The Parent Guarantor_

The Parent Guarantor will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or
assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to,
any Person, unless:

(1) either the Parent Guarantor is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person (the “Successor Parent Guarantor”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, any State of the
United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of
Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Parent Guarantor (if not the Parent
Guarantor) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Parent Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture and
(b) all obligations of the Parent Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (or the Successor
Parent Guarantor shall have entered into security documents creating Liens over the
relevant Collateral on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Security
Documents then in force), as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the
Successor Parent Guarantor as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by
the Successor Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Parent Guarantor or the Successor Parent Guarantor, as applicable, shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the
effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any) comply with the terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that, in the case of the Successor Parent Guarantor, such supplemental indenture (if
any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion
of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Parent Guarantor, which properties and assets, if held by the Parent Guarantor instead of
such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Parent Guarantor on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Parent Guarantor.

The Successor Parent Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every
right and power of, the Parent Guarantor under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under
the Indenture or its Notes Guarantee.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or other disposition) will, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or
into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all its assets
as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions
to, any Person, unless:

(1) the other Person is the Issuer or, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor
substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease, sell or other disposition;

(2) (a) either (x) a Subsidiary Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental
indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and
all obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable (such
resulting, surviving or transferee Person, the “Successor Subsidiary Guarantor”); and
(b) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(3) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall
not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating
with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to the Issuer, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor; (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or
part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the
heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1) and (4)
under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (1) through (3) under the heading “—The Subsidiary
_Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction._

(3) “—Limitation on the Sponsor SPVs”; and

(4) “—Limitation on Liens” (but only with respect to the Sponsor SPVs).

In addition, the release (including any partial release) of any Lien over any Collateral under any
Security Document and/or the making of any material amendments to any Security Document
will be validly given or made (as applicable) by the Security Agent acting alone and on behalf of
the Holders if such amendment or partial release (i) relates to Liens granted under Security

Documents over securities issued by one or more Sponsor SPVs or the Parent Guarantor and, (ii) is
made or given (as applicable) in connection with a Qualifying IPO and for the purpose of
allowing:

(1) in respect of a Qualifying IPO of the Parent Guarantor, the holders of securities issued
by the Parent Guarantor to debit, and dispose of, any such securities that are credited
on the securities accounts opened in their name and pledged under Security
Documents; or

(2) in respect of a Qualifying IPO of a Sponsor SPV, the holders of securities issued by that
Sponsor SPV to transfer any such securities free of any charge or lien; and

(3) in each case up to the maximum number of such securities required for the purpose of
implementing that Qualifying IPO, provided that: (a) no such amendment or partial
release may be implemented or granted more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
relevant Qualifying IPO completion date; and (b) if the Qualifying IPO is not
completed as at the initially contemplated Qualifying IPO completion date (unless
postponed to a subsequent date falling no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
such initially contemplated completion date, in which case the following sentence
shall apply as at such postponed date), the relevant security holders shall promptly
credit back all shares debited from the pledged securities account or (as the case may
be) transferred free of any Lien and, if required, enter into any Security Documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Security Agent and any other relevant
representatives of the relevant secured parties (as the case may be), acting reasonably,
to ensure that such secured parties benefit from the same scope of Collateral under
Security Documents as the one existing prior to the amendment or partial release
mentioned above.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

None of the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral
(it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral
Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and none of the Sponsor
SPVs, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee
and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in
any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, and the Security Agent may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement,
release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, and the Security Agent may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or
otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted
Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to
time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the
Sponsor SPVs, the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security
Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) and (ii) above, the Security
Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or
otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer
delivers to the Trustee, either (a) a solvency opinion, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from
an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (b) a certificate from
the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
which confirms the solvency of the Issuer or the relevant Person granting such Security Interest,

208


-----

after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (c) an Opinion of Counsel, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or
at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified
and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall
Guarantee the Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Revolving Credit Facility) unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to
the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee;
_provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a_
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be
inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or
result in (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and
coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in
connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures
pursuant to clause (2) undertaken in connection with, such Notes Guarantee which cannot be
avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. At the
option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor’s liability to
the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees releases.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor
may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (1) there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been
designated as a Guarantor or (2) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as
at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and
secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Certain
_insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and the security interests.”_

209


-----

**_Additional intercreditor agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5),
(6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the
Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and
release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest
error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that
is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the
Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and
ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its
opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to
any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted
below under “—Amendments and waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby;
provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

210


-----

**_Payments for consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Secured Notes for
or as in inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions
of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and
is paid to all holders of the Senior Secured Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the
time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in
any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, to
exclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where the solicitation of such
consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or the
payment of the consideration therefor, would require the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the
European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in
good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be
materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any
substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services
authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under
applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment
Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension
_Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior_
Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of
the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured
Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock”;

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_consolidation—The Issuer”;_

(7) “—Maintenance of Double Luxco structure”;

(8) “—Limitation on Sponsor SPVs”;

(9) “—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(10) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and
will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from
the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant set forth under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” and the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of_
“Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is

211


-----

classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered_
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(ii) of
the second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Affiliate transactions,”
and (b) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any
action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on restrictions on distribution from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on restrictions on distribution
_from Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the
Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment
Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension
Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade
Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph
under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for
the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall
not be obliged to notify Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a
Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an
Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or
ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the
definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into, and such baskets
or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent
with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and
the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the
applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited
Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or
ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a
result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Total Assets or
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition is
permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided that if the
Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive
agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are
entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition.

### Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior
Secured Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Sponsor SPV or any Restricted
Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the agreements contained in
the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay
principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of
the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or (b) results in
the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”), and, in each case the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together_
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been
a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €25.0
million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Parent
Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”) (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Permitted
Reorganization);

(6) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after
the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in
full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of €10.0
million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or the Security Documents, or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert
in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such
Default continues for 10 days;

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor or a Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or the Parent Guarantor or any Guarantor that
is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes
Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

213


-----

(9) failure by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Sponsor SPV, as applicable, to comply
with the provisions of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Centre of main interest,” “—Certain covenants—Maintenance of Double_
_Luxco_ _structure,”_ “—Certain _covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Holdco”_ and “—Certain
_covenants—Limitation on Sponsor SPVs”._

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and
the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued
and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4)
under the immediately preceding paragraph has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default
or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such
Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become
and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as
provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. Additionally, the Indenture shall not include any provisions
incorporating, giving effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the
Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing
Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest
or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior
Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the
Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its
sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense caused by taking or not taking such action.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

214


-----

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its
sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of such security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses
caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs
and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must
give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except
in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any
Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines
that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain
Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled
“—Certain Covenants —Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole discretion.
It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes
and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the
provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

### Amendments and waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). If any amendment, supplement or
waiver will only affect the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or the Senior Secured Floating Rate
Notes, only the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent of
the holders of the majority of all Senior Secured Notes), as the case may be, shall be required.

215


-----

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8)
of this paragraph, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
affected (or alternatively, with respect to the Senior Secured Notes held by such Holder only, the
consent of an affected Holder) (provided, however that if any amendment, supplement, waiver
or other modification or consent will only affect the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or the
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the
case of clause (8) of this paragraph, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will be
required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to
an amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or
change the time at which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as
described under “—Optional redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior
Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due
dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding
_taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in_
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that
would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or
an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured
Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, changes to the governing law of the Indenture and the Senior
Secured Notes shall be permitted pursuant to the first sentence of the first paragraph of this
section entitled “Amendment and waivers.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior
Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

216


-----

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or
the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or
any of the Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by an Officer of the
Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for a Notes Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or
“—Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to
confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured
Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent
that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to
be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties
to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any property which is required by the Security
Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in
the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) as provided in “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ or
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”; or

(11) to provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Senior Secured Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured
Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of 163(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code).

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions
of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or
waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a
tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

217


-----

### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the
Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or
indirect common control with, the Issue will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance
trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant
described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change
_of control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of_
_Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross_
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the
security default provision described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor_
and the Sponsor SPVs), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of tax counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial
owners of the relevant Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of tax counsel in the
United States must be based on a ruling received from, or published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
occurring after the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Issuer and the Guarantors;

218


-----

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the
Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

### Satisfaction and discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange
of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding
Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated
and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain
Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the
funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation;
or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i)
have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within
one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the
name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on
the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured
Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the
case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Indenture and all sums payable to the Trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be;
and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of
the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied
with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (5)).

### No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of
the Issuer, the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

### Concerning the Trustee and certain agents

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture

219


-----

and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent
becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such
Agent.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee
or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

### Notices

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of
the Senior Secured Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and
Clearstream. Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day the notice is given
to Euroclear or Clearstream.

Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail
or other equivalent means and shall be deemed to have been given on the later date of its
publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Failure to mail a notice or communication
to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a
notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not
the addressee receives it.

### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

### Currency indemnity and calculation of euro-denominated restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes
Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other
than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will

220


-----

indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any
event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of
a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will
apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum
due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

### Listing

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and
for permission to be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Secured
Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on
obtaining this listing or permission.

### Enforceability of judgments

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors,
including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

### Consent to jurisdiction and service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The Senior Secured Indenture will
provide that the Issuer, the Sponsor SPVs and each Guarantor will appoint CT Corporation System
as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or
New York state court located in the City of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, changes to
this “Consent to Jurisdiction and “Service” paragraph may be effected pursuant to the first
sentence of the paragraph entitled “—Amendments and waivers.”

### Governing law

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For
the avoidance of doubt, changes to this “Governing law” paragraph may be effected pursuant to
the first sentence of the paragraph entitled “—Amendments and waivers.”

### Certain definitions

the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases,
redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement
of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior
to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated
giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial
officer of the Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds
therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference
period and may give effect to cost savings or cost reduction synergies that have occurred;
_provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness_
Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph of
the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the
discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results

covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the
Calculation Date, or that are to be made on or substantially concurrently with the

on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith
by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) as if they had occurred on
the first day of the reference period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued
operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or
group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests
therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account
anticipated cost reduction synergies resulting from any such disposal, as determined in
good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer responsible for
accounting or financial reporting);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets
constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of
prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such
disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such
Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate
Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is not

230


-----

denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

(7) the difference between: (i) the total pro forma consolidated amount received or
receivable pursuant to CICE for the four-quarter reference period as determined on
the basis of CICE applicable to all relevant entities of the Group as at the end of the
period, and (ii) the total amount received or receivable pursuant to CICE already
included in Consolidated EBITDA for that period, shall be added to Consolidated
EBITDA.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Income,
(a) calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Issuer (including in respect of anticipated expense and cost reductions and
synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost reductions and synergies were
realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also include the reasonably anticipated
full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by a responsible financial or chief
accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs, business optimization programs,
centralized purchasing programs or other restructurings or reorganizations that have been
initiated by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as though programs, restructurings or
reorganizations had been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant reference period
(regardless of whether these cost savings and expense and cost reduction and expense and cost
synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial statements to the extent prepared);
provided that such anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost savings are
reasonably anticipated to be realized within 18 months after the consummation of the cost
savings program, business optimization program, centralized purchasing program, restructuring,
reorganizations or any operational change or the purchase or sale or other event which is
expected to result in such anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies and cost
savings), and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding on any date of
determination and Fixed Charges for the relevant period, pro forma effect shall be given to any
Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement or discharge of
Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant period.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Consolidated EBITDA and all outstanding Indebtedness of any
company or business to be acquired pursuant to a signed purchase agreement (which may be
subject to one or more conditions precedent) may be given pro forma effect for the purpose of
calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer.

amount of any outstanding Parent Senior Notes Incurred pursuant to clause (4) of the covenant
set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitations on the Parent Guarantor” or clause (4) of the

that is secured by a Lien on (a) the Collateral (excluding Indebtedness to the extent secured on a
junior priority basis) or (b) assets or property of the Issuer or a Guarantor that do not constitute

ratio of (x) the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate

prior to the date of such determination for which internal consolidated financial statements of
the Issuer are available, in each case calculated with such pro forma and other adjustments as are
consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any
Indebtedness Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph of the covenant set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
(other than for the purposes of the calculation of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage

# Book-entry, delivery and form

### General

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the
“Rule 144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global Notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global
Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common
depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear, and Clearstream and
registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under
the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such
participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the
Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants.
The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not
be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights
of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and neither the Paying Agent,
the Registrar, nor the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of
the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes if:

  - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor;

  - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

  - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
either Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the
Indenture.

257


-----

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its
current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in
“Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the
Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership
of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered
office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the
part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1 in excess thereof will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered
Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we
will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a
holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss that any of them may suffer
if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Transfer restrictions.”

**_Redemption of the Global Notes_**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for
cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the
Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect
the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests
will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection

258


-----

with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**_Payments on Global Notes_**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will
in turn make such payments to the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” If any such deduction or
withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary_
in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry
Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or
owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as
the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of BookEntry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the
Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or
the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a BookEntry Interest;

  - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**_Currency of payment for the Global Notes_**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither we nor the Trustee nor
the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment.

**_Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests_**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only

259


-----

at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking
of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its
participants.

**_Transfers_**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants,
which rules and procedures may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states
that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed in “Transfer restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the
legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S.
Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor or a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in Global
Notes only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and exchange”
and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Application will be made to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official List of
the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and

260


-----

Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

**_Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system_**

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee
nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United
States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a
payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be
performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if
Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes
are set forth under “Listing and general information—Clearing information.”

**_Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within
the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and we
urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

261


-----

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their
account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial
interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing industry
practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests
or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled
to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants
owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would
authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

# Tax considerations

### Certain French tax considerations

The following is a summary of certain material French tax considerations relating to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes by an investor who is not a French tax resident
for French tax purposes, who does not hold the Notes in connection with a permanent
establishment or a fixed base in France and who is neither a shareholder of the Issuer nor a
related party of the Issuer within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French Tax Code (Code
_général des impôts)._

This summary is based on the French tax laws and regulations, as currently in effect and applied
by the French tax authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect,
or to different interpretations.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to any prospective investor.

Prospective investors in the Notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors as to
the French tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes in light of their
particular circumstances.

**_Payments of interest and other revenues with respect to the Notes_**

Payments of interest and assimiliated revenues made by a debtor that is established in France with
respect to a particular debt (including debt in the form of notes as the Notes) are not subject to the
withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code unless such payments are
made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif)
within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a “Non-Cooperative State”). If such
payments are made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% mandatory withholding tax is applicable
(subject to certain exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable
provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective
of the noteholder’s tax residence or registered headquarters. The list of Non-Cooperative States is
published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated yearly.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the French Tax Code, interest on debt and other
assimilated revenues paid by a debtor or an issuer of notes that is established in France may not
be deductible from the debtor’s or the issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to
persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid to a bank account opened in
a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State. Under certain conditions, any such
nondeductible interest or other revenues may be recharacterized as constructive dividends
pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case it may be subject to the
withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at a rate of 30% or 75%
(subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A-III of
the French Tax Code nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine
transactions and is not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the nondeductibility set out
under Article 238 A of the French Tax Code and the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis
2 of the French Tax Code which may be levied as a consequence of such nondeductibility, will
apply in respect of a particular issue of debt instruments (including debt in the form of notes
such as the Notes) provided that the debtor or the issuer can prove that the main purpose and
effect of such issuance is not to enable payments of interest or other assimilated revenues to be
made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts (French administrative guidelines)
referenced as BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20140211 n°550 and 990, BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40-20140211
n°70 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60-20150320 n°10 (the “Administrative Guidelines”), an issue of
debt securities benefits from the Exception without the issuer having to provide any evidence
supporting the main purpose and effect of such issuance of debt securities (the “Safe Harbor”), if
such notes are:

 - offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State that is not a

263


-----

Non-Cooperative State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring
the registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market
authority); or

 - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or a multilateral securities
trading system, provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative
State and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment
services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market
operator, investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

 - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a
securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article
L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign
depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a NonCooperative State.

The Notes qualify as debt securities under French commercial law. Considering that (i) as of the
date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading on the Official List of
the Exchange, which is not a Non-Cooperative State, and such market is operated by a market
operator that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and/or (ii) at the time of their issue, the
Notes will be admitted to the operations of Euroclear and Clearstream, the Notes will fall under
the Exception.

Accordingly, payments of interest and other assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will
be exempt from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A-III of the French Tax Code.
Moreover, under the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other
assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated
amount, they will be subject neither to the nondeductibility set forth under Article 238 A nor to
the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code solely on account of
their being paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in a Non-Cooperative
State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in such a Non-Cooperative State.

**_Withholding tax applicable to French tax resident individuals_**

Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French Tax Code (i.e., where the paying agent (établissement
_payeur) is located in France), subject to certain exceptions, interest received by French tax_
resident individuals is subject to a 24% levy withheld at source, which is deductible from their
personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. Social
contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied at source at an
aggregate rate of 15.5% on interest paid to French tax resident individuals. Holders of Notes who
are French tax resident individuals are urged to consult with their usual tax advisor on the way
the 24% levy and the 15.5% social contributions are collected, where the paying agent is not
located in France.

**_Taxation on disposal_**

A Noteholder who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who does not hold the
Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in France should
not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realized on
the sale, exchange or disposal of the Notes.

**_Transfer tax_**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the transfer of Notes,
provided that such transfers are not recorded in a deed registered with the French tax authorities
and that the FTT does not become applicable.

### Certain general tax considerations—payments by a Guarantor

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may
be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under
the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may
apply.

### Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential tax effects. This summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as
defined below), except for the discussion under “—U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax
_advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their ownership of_
_the Notes, including the significant penalities for non-compliance—Foreign Account Tax_
_Compliance Act,” and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S._
federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.
This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for
investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), by a U.S. holder who acquires the Notes pursuant to this Offering for
cash at the price indicated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

  - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

  - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the
“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code,
the Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date
of this Offering Memorandum, all of which are subject to change at any time. Changes in such
rules, or new interpretations thereof, may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect
the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek
any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our
statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the
event of litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes from those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of
income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal
taxation or all tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular
circumstances. In addition, it does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws.
For example, this summary does not address:

  - tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities
that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks,
financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other
pass-through entities and investors in such entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance
companies;

  - tax consequences to holders who are members of an “expanded group” or “modified
expanded group” with the Issuer within the meaning of the proposed Treasury regulations
under Code Section 385;

  - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,
constructive sale or conversion transaction, or a straddle;

265


-----

  - tax consequences to a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

  - tax consequences to U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules;

  - tax consequences to persons who are not U.S. holders;

  - persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States
or who have a taxable presence therein;

  - persons who actually or constructively own more than 5% of our voting stock;

  - alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax on
net investment income; or

  - any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S.
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership considering
an investment in the Notes, or a partner in such a partnership, you should consult your own tax
advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes.

**The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational**
**purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering**
**the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S.**
**federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the**
**Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of**
**any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from
payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their_
stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Change of control”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to_
take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional
payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based
in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that
additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the
meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a
U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year
during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However,
our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above,
a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable
yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we
would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as
ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax
consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment
debt instruments.

**_Interest_**

Interest on a Note (including any non-U.S. taxes withheld from payments thereof and any
additional amounts paid in respect of such withholding taxes) generally will be taxable to a
U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the
U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

266


-----

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. holder that receives an interest payment in
foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the exchange rate
in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars.

An accrual basis U.S. holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an
interest payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods.
Under the first method, the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average
exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period
that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).

Under the second method, the U.S. holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued
on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the
part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually
received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis
U.S. holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in
effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or
thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note)
denominated in foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. holder may recognize exchange gain or
loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received
(translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual
period and the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as described above),
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss
generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

A U.S. holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest
(including additional amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to
deduct or credit taxes applies to all of such U.S. holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a
particular tax year). Interest on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit
allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex
limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the
calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or
deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

If you sell or exchange a Note, or if a Note that you hold is retired, you generally will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the transaction (less any
amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest that you have not previously included in
income, which amount will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in
income) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such
a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount
realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the
spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S.
holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount
at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election
available to accrual basis U.S. holders with regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded
on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by
the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S.
holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent
that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and
such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

267


-----

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss
that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of an Note generally will be U.S.-source
capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note
for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S.
holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with
respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as
an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and generally will be treated as ordinary income or
loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal
amount” of a Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss
attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the
principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of
the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the
spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may realize
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued interest, which
will be treated as discussed under “—Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will realize any foreign currency
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued interest) only to
the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Foreign currency received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, redemption or
retirement of a Note will have a tax basis equal to the U.S. dollar value at the time the foreign
currency is received. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of foreign currency
(including their use to purchase Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) generally will be U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain
tax shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum
amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an individual or a trust), such as the receipt or accrual of
interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or
foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their
tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an
investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

Individuals (and, under proposed Treasury Regulations, certain entities) who own “specified
foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally
are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The
Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial institutions.

**_U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing_**
**_disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for_**
**_noncompliance_**

_Backup withholding and information reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated
interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement
or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient
(such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor
(which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding,

268


-----

currently at a rate of 28%, on such payments if: (i) the U.S. holder fails to furnish an accurate
taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the
IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. holder is
incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of
the Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished
a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a U.S. person, and that the IRS has not notified
such U.S. holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability. You may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for
a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six
months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru
payments” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially
modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury
Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to
enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a
manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding
under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no
additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

### Certain Luxembourg tax considerations

The following is a summary of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing,
owning and disposing of the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible
tax situations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. It is
included herein solely for preliminary information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should
it construed to be, legal or tax advice. This summary does not allow any conclusion to be drawn
with respect to issues not specifically addressed. The following description of Luxembourg tax
law is based on the Luxembourg law and regulations as in effect and as interpreted by the
Luxembourg tax authorities on the date of this Offering Memorandum. These laws and
interpretations are subject to change that may occur after such date, even with retroactive or
retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax
consequences of subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Notes, including the
application and effect of any federal, state or local taxes under the tax laws of the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg and each country of which they are residents or citizens.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax,
duty, levy impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax
law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax
encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax
(impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) and
personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) as well as a temporary equalization tax (impôt
_d’équilibrage budgétaire temporaire). A corporate taxpayer may further be subject to net wealth_
tax (impôt sur la fortune), as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal
business tax, as well as the solidarity surcharge, invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers
resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal

269


-----

income tax, to the solidarity surcharge and to the temporary equalization tax. Under certain
circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Luxembourg taxation of non-resident holders_**

Holders of the Notes will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in
Luxembourg solely by reason of the holding, execution, performance, delivery, exchange and/or
enforcement of the Notes.

Subject to FATCA described above, under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is
no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to non-resident holders
of Notes, or on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg
withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Notes held by non-resident
holders of Notes.

Non-resident holders of Notes not having a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative with whom the holding of the Notes are connected are not subject to any other
taxation in relation with the Notes.

**_Luxembourg taxation of Luxembourg resident holders_**

_Luxembourg resident individuals_

Subject to the discussion of FATCA contained herein, under Luxembourg general tax laws
currently in force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest
made to Luxembourg resident corporate holder of Notes by the Issuer or the Guarantors.

Under the law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the “Relibi Law”), payments of interest or
similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the
benefit of an individual beneficial holder who is resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a
withholding tax of 10% (in principle increased to 20% as from January 1, 2017). Responsibility for
the withholding of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of
interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law would be subject to
withholding tax of 10% (in principle increased to 20% as from January 1, 2017).

An individual holder of Notes may also opt for the application of a 10% tax (in principle
increased to 20% as from January 1, 2017) in full discharge of income tax in accordance with the
Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest on the Notes has been made or ascribed by a
paying agent established in an EU Member State (other than Luxembourg), or in a member state
of the European Economic Area (other than an EU Member State). The option for this levy must
cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial
owner during the entire civil year. The Luxembourg resident individual who is the beneficial
owner of interest is responsible for the declaration and the payment of such final levy.

An individual Luxembourg holder, acting in the course of the management of his/her private
wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption
premiums or issue discounts under the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on
such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law.

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the
Notes by a Luxembourg holder, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts
in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg
income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the acquisition
of the Notes and the Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes.

An individual Luxembourg holder, who acts in the course of the management of his/her private
wealth and who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion
of the gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income in respect of the Notes in his/
her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated separately in the
agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy has been levied in accordance with the Relibi
Law.

270


-----

Luxembourg resident individual holders acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any
interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in
any form whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax and municipal business
tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference between the sale,
repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost
or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg resident companies_

Luxembourg corporate holders must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any gain
realised on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax
and municipal business tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the difference
between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and the lower
of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

**_Net wealth tax_**

Luxembourg resident holders and non-resident holders who have a permanent establishment or
a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom the Notes are attributable, are
subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder is (i) an individual, (ii)
an undertaking for collective investment subject to the amended law of December 17, 2010, (iii),
a securitization company governed by the amended law of March 22, 2004, (iv) a company
governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004, on venture capital vehicles, (v) a specialized
investment fund governed by the amended law of February 13, 2007, (vi) a family wealth
management company governed by the amended law of May 11, 2007, (vii) a professional
pension institution governed by the amended law of July 13, 2005 and (viii) a reserved alternative
investment fund vehicle governed by the law of July 23, 2016.

However, (i) a Luxembourg resident securitization company governed by the amended law of
March 22, 2004, on securitization, (ii) a professional pension institution governed by the
amended law of July 13, 2005, (iii) a reserved alternative investment fund vehicle (opting for the
treatment as a venture capital vehicle) governed by the law of July 23, 2016, and (iv) and a
Luxembourg resident company governed by the amended law of June 15, 2004, on venture
capital vehicles shall be subject to the minimum net wealth tax (“MNWT”) charge according to
the amended law of October 16, 1934, on net wealth tax.

The MNWT levied on companies having their statutory seat or central administration in
Luxembourg. For entities for which the sum of fixed financial assets, transferable securities, such
as the Notes, and cash at bank exceeds 90% of their total gross assets and €350,000, the MNWT is
set at €3,210 (in principle increased to €4,815 as from January 1, 2017). For all other companies
having their statutory seat or central administration in Luxembourg which do not fall within the
scope of the €3,210 MNWT, the MNWT ranges from €535 to €32,100, depending on the
company’s total gross assets.

**_Other taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in
Luxembourg by the holders as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these
taxes be payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase of the
Notes (except in the case of voluntary registration in Luxembourg).

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder is a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are included in his/her taxable
base for inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on
the transfer of the Notes upon death of a holder in cases where the deceased was not a resident
of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her death. Luxembourg gift tax
may be due on a gift or donation of the Notes if the gift is recorded in a deed executed before a
Luxembourg notary or otherwise registered in Luxembourg.

# Certain insolvency law considerations and limitations on the validity and enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and
the security interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or the Collateral is
being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar
event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a
future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions
could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your
ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects
of insolvency law in France and Luxembourg.

### European Union

The Issuer and the Guarantors in France and the security providers in France and Luxembourg are
incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, on insolvency proceedings, as
amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than
Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as
that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a
debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation
that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence
of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a
“debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken
into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a debtor, including, in
particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority
of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors
are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is
determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the COMI of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office,
the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only
if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(h) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is
defined to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries on non-transitory economic
activity with human means and goods.

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its
COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor
has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding-up proceedings” listed in

272


-----

Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where
main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been
commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State
where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member
State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of a
creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member
State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective of whether the
insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will,
subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law
of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States
so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator
appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings
(because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that
Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other
Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been
commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the
contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State
where the debtor has assets.

A new Council Regulation (EC) no. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (the
“New EU Insolvency Regulation”) came into force on June 26, 2015, and will gradually replace
the EU Insolvency Regulation although, for the most part, but its main provisions will only
become effective on June 26, 2017. One of the main changes introduced by the New EU
Insolvency Regulation consists in an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent
COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the rebuttable
presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the
opening commencement of secondary proceedings in another EU Member State—which will no
longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has
an establishment in such EU Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency
proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the
three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.

### France

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the COMI of the Issuer
or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French proceedings
affecting creditors, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat _ad_ _hoc_ or _conciliation_
proceedings) and court-administered proceedings being either safeguard proceedings,
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde,
_sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings_
(redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire). In general,
French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment
over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes
and/or the Notes Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security
interests in the Collateral.

Under the European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, if a
debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall have
jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the debtor’s COMI is situated in France. In the
case of a debtor that is a legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be
its COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the COMI of a debtor is
in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual elements.

273


-----

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil) (“Article 1343-5”).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial
proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into
account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule
over a maximum period of two years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that
any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a
rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as published
annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment
of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 will suspend any pending enforcement
measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be
due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

With respect to grace periods under Article 1343-5, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French
Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the
execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors that have
participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security
administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
when it is unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets taking into account
available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of
the court ruling commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date,
which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for
fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court
decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings.
The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below).

**_Court-assisted proceedings—mandat ad hoc and conciliation_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of courtassisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement
with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders (e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its
indebtedness).

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In_
practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties
but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and
confidential by law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer
(mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision
of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the
_mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that_
appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between
the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those
creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement or forced to accept it.
_Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are_
not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have
accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so. In any event, the debtor
retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 (see
“—Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is
not formally approved by him/her. The order of the president of the court appointing a
_mandataire ad hoc is notified for information purposes to the debtor’s auditors._

274


-----

Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”)
or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by
law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose
name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court.
The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being able to request a onemonth extension). The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an
agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its
difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the
debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those
creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it.
Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are
not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have
accepted to take part in the proceedings usually agree not to do so. In any event, the debtor
retains the right to petition the judge who commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace
period under Article 1343-5 (see “—Grace periods”), such decision being taken after hearing the
_conciliateur._

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the
president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement
binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action
by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the
conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire),
but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial
Court at the request of the debtor, if (i) the debtor is not cash-flow insolvent or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s cash-flow insolvency, (ii) the
conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and
(iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such
approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above,
except that in addition:

  - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or
services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than
shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority
of payment over all pre-commencement and post-proceedings claims (except with respect
to certain pre-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money
Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization
proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

  - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings,
the court may not reschedule the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money
Lien without their holders’ consent to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted;

  - the works council or employee representatives are informed of the content of the
conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the
clerk’s office (greffe) of the court. The publicly available court decision approving such
agreement will, however, only disclose the amount of any New Money Lien and the
guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same;

  - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is
transmitted to its statutory auditors; and

  - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test”), and therefore the starting
date of the hardening period (as defined herein—see “—The hardening period (période
_suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings”), cannot be set by the_
court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement
by the court (except in the case of fraud).

275


-----

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request
of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement
(mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution, and while the agreement is in force:

  - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not
be compounded;

  - the debtor retains the right to petition the court that commenced the conciliation
proceedings for a grace period pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see
“—Grace periods” ), in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to
the conciliation proceedings that are not already subject to the conciliation agreement, in
which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliateur (provided that
the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the implementation of the
agreement, as referred to above); and

  - a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest)
with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation
agreement as well as from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation
proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the
president of the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in
relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation
agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining
payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or forbidden.
The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors that is
likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a
mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings
have been consulted on the matter, the conciliateur may be appointed with a mission to
organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of
the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent
safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with
certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the conciliateur may be directly
considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings
after consultation of the State prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation
of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by
reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation
proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason
only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation
proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by
creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

**_Court-administered proceedings—safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion,
initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it
is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited
to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is
requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed
administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small companies where the court considers
that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the business of the debtor
during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision
commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court makes a decision on
the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court
276


-----

appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de
_plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective_
control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of
the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the
debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management
decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings
(i) after commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en
_état de cessation des paiements) before commencement of the proceedings, (ii) at any time_
during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in the case where the debtor
is insolvent, or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and,
if any, the bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is
manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings end. At any time during the observation period, the court may also convert such
proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly
impossible.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the
debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the proceedings is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example,
the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed
for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as
collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under
the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan
being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of
the business.

_Standard consultation: This applies to debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory_
auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant, and who have 150 employees or less or a
turnover of €20 million or less.

In such a case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the courtappointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a
claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted
individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the
creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this
consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing
treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in the
situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In
practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum
possible length of the plan (ten years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as
soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal
(other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’
representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the
court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were
submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose

277


-----

on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for claims
with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity
date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed
without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the
judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual
instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural
businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later
than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first
payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies, the accounts of which are_
certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered
accountant (expert-comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than
€20 million), or upon the debtor’s or the administrator’s request and with the consent of the
court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two
creditors’ committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of
the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

  - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or
advances in favor of the debtor (the “credit institutions committee”); and

  - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total
amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate
in such committee by the court-appointed administrator (the “major suppliers
committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes
and including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all
holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which
all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of
the governing law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee.
Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of
the committee.

The proposed plan:

  - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before
the commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

  - may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific
regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps
(debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital
increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the
provisions of the plan, where applicable).

Creditors who are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers
committee may also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the
committees and of the bondholders’ general meeting, it being specified that approval of any
such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in
the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed
administrator (administrateur judiciaire)). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own
alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission.
The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must

278


-----

be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the
creditors casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors’ committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if
applicable, inform the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating
to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as
of any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such
person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/
bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by
the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or
of the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to
voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for
which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is
adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or take
part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted
for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote.
Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and
determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the
committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The
court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required
shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court,
the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders
(including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted in
accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above.

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general
meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on
the plan or because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the
request of the court-appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the
observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based
consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the
time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as
the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the court empowers the court-appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in
order to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by-laws
(including modifications of its share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order
that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the
shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the
shares with voting rights.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the bondholders’
general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
_mandataire judiciaire or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings_
into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is
impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly
becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations,_
social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions
under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market
conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also
decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security
interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local
administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations
may grant relief from all direct taxes. With regard to indirect taxes, relief may only be granted
from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered proceedings—accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard_**

A debtor that is the subject of conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have
been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those:

  - which publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French
Commercial Code; or

  - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public
accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million
(excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings regime is broadly applicable to
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible
with the accelerated timing, since the total duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is
three months and the duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is only one month
(unless the court decides to extend it by an additional month). However, certain provisions
relating to ongoing contracts and provisions relating to the recovery of assets by owners
benefiting from title retention clauses do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to
vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to
them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings
and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity
capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt
rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not
belong to one of the committees or are not bondholders.

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors, accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit
institutions committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is
suspended until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The
debtor will be prohibited from paying any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred
prior to the commencement of the proceedings, to any creditor to whom the accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply. Such
amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in
accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the
tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary
course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

  - the debtor must not be cash-flow insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially
requested the opening of conciliation;

  - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

  - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is
not in a position to overcome;

  - the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see
above) or the court shall have authorized such constitution in the opening decision; and

  - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its
business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the

280


-----

proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’
committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general
assembly, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months, following the
commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable
deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed
to the creditors outside of the committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory
auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated
safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below)
unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

**_Court-administered proceedings—judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement _judiciaire)_ or liquidation (liquidation _judiciaire)_
proceedings may be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of
liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is
required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation
proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers
(including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability if it
fails to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the
court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be
more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be
most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial
liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would
be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation
period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard
proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that
the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all
cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’
representatives (if any).

In the event of judicial reorganization, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period,
which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor
with the debtor’s help, or for the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The courtappointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission
_d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of_
the debtor (mission d’administration).

Committees of creditors and a bondholders’ general meeting may be created under the same
conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). At any time during the observation period,
the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the
partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor
if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the
proceedings is decided by the court.

In judicial reorganization proceedings, if a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by
Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court may appoint a trustee (mandataire de
_justice) to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders who refuse_
to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of
the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization
plan.

281


-----

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will
recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the courtappointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it
controls (within the meaning of the French labor code) one or more companies having together
at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to
the national or regional economy and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems
to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and allows the
continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the review of the
options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the State prosecutor and (y) at least three months having elapsed from the
court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required
to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the
reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

  - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and
vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to
the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or

  - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan,
the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the
share capital increase and holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital
providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement
with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholders’ meetings;
the minority shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that
their shares be purchased by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement
between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the
new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not
exceed the duration of the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a
liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No
maximum time period is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process.
The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation
operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds
from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for
payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the
managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

(a) an asset sale plan (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor and organize such sale of_
the business as a going concern); or

(b) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide
to:

(i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate
assets only));

(ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous
purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy
judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

(iii) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential
interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a
private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the
hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing
(procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility of implementing such
process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has
varied.

282


-----

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has
sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation
process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

  - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate
compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

  - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a
_mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received_
from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the
court order commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no
earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the
insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that
approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above).
The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period
(période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while
others are voidable by the court.

  - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some
creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no
consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the
debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other party, payments of debts due but
not payable at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner that is not
commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for previously
incurred obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the attachment or
seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer
of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way
of security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement
(fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt
incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from
seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

  - Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are
payable, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties
(avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the
hardening period, in each case if the court determines that the creditor knew that the
debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for
no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to
the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or SFA
proceedings.

**_Status of creditors during safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard,_**
**_judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the
acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the
court does not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation
of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions
_modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or_
_increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings”_
(in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909,

283


-----

which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally
decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be
able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that
other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may
have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its contractual
obligations post-filing (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent
consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of
liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s
obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the
adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period
of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only
occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the
date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one
year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred for at least one year
(however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

(b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of
the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of
related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge
_commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued_
operation of the business);

(c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of
the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of
the observation period or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to
the debtor;

(d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were
incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in
consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor during this period,
must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts
incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited
exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly
filed within one year of the expiration of the observation period;

(e) creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor
of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are
safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with
respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if
the objective of such legal action is: (i) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of
money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court
determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to
terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (iii) to
enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except where such asset—
whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable—is located in another EU
Member State, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be
affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of
the EU Insolvency Regulation; and

(f) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to
other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an
ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors who
fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above).

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two

284


-----

months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des
_annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_
outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts,
with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their
maturity date. Creditors on whose behalves no claims have been submitted during the relevant
period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection
with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors
under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the
creditors’ representative with the list of all of its creditors and all of their claims. Where the
debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as
reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on
behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their
behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their
own proofs of claim.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor
draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which
is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of
claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative
and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the
debtor (within the above two- or four-months’ time limit). Creditors who did not take part in the
conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, debts owed to creditors other than banks,
financial institutions or bondholders continue to be payable in the ordinary course.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard
plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the
terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated
towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides
to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the
former creditor’s representative) in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling the
relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the
business is considered, the court will usually appoint an administrator to manage the debtor
during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and to organize the
sale of the business process.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business, it can also set a time period during which
the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not
be sold without its consent.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials’ fees), creditors who
benefit from a New Money Lien (see above), post-commencement creditors and the French State
(taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain precommencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to postcommencement creditors.

**_Creditors’ liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced,
creditors may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the
debtor, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference
with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the
facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to
support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be
cancelled or reduced by the court.

285


-----

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

  - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations that would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225 216 of the French
Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241 3, L. 242 6 or L. 244 1
of the French Commercial Code; and

  - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or
guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the
purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court
could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the
relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it
found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the
guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received
are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors which are subsidiaries of the Issuer
and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the
aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer,
or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its
Guarantees. As a consequence, in particular, the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantor is
expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the aggregate of the existing
proceeds loan of €54 million made available to on-lend the proceeds of the issuance of the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and the existing proceeds loan of €80 million made available to onlend the amount drawn under the Bridge Facility, in each case, to the Subsidiary Guarantor. Any
payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of
any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due
by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred
to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could
be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Guarantee, an economic
return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction
entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and
that in a comparable arm’s length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of
the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to
the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions
required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee
nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of
these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock
company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities
account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The
securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge
(déclaration de nantissement de compte de titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of
the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant
shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de
_titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests_

286


-----

that are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of
a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount
that is due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over
securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may
generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the
pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured
creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure
(pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the
secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors
choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual
foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the
foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial
attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If
the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of
the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the
actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale
of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such
securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in
accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction
procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the
value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/
or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a
value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of
companies or groups of companies.

**_Parallel debt—trust_**

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim
secured by such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot
be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary
(fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the
Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the
beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for the
creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) that
mirror the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of
the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes
the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges
governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the
obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests
except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the
security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in
France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security

287


-----

agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof
of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene
French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result
of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal
practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such
circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before
French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the
proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a
case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability
under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security
Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged
by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds
from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly
important following Defaults or Events of Default (each as defined therein), and acts as trustee in
the interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass.
com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in
safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be
derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law
applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been
generally recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of, inter alia, the Security Agent. To the
extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on
this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In
addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance
both in and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including,
without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of
the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor’s
or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security
or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the
commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or by
any of the creditors of such debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency
proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the
debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the
case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery
as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor
and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such

288


-----

debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the
legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the
counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the
security interests in the Collateral or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the
Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee
could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the
creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful
challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or
the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the
Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the
Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from
subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be
held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a
result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme
Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement
such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30-2 of the French Commercial
Code which states that, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the
safeguard or continuation plan which is put to the vote of the creditors’ committees takes into
consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors
which were entered into prior to the commencement of the proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, has
received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect
to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account_**
**_pledges by French courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second
or lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a
pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which
the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security
interests that are not registered, in official ledgers such as pledges over securities accounts
(nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the
priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are
registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the
securities account from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from
granting a second or lower ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the
shares of such a company will therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is
transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as “tiers convenu” (entiercement), that the
first ranking and second or lower ranking secured parties have consented to the creation of
second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured parties have accepted their
appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of
both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This structure has not
been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second or lower
ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower
ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Guarantees (as applicable) following an
enforcement event.

289


-----

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of second ranking bank accounts_**
**_pledges over the bank accounts_**

Certain pledges over the bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches
are available for security interests that are not registered in official ledgers, such as pledges over
bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the
relevant bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account
from granting a second or lower ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has
not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second or
lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.

### Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and are in
principle also subject to Luxembourg insolvency law. The following is a brief description of
certain aspects of Luxembourg insolvency laws.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as
“insolvency proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in
Luxembourg having its COMI in Luxembourg or an establishment in Luxembourg within the
meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, or the EU Insolvency
Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings):

  - insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company
or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may
commence insolvency proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
(cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open insolvency_
proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main
effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the
company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured
creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon
foreclosure of the assets;

  - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only
be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a
provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured
creditors. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the
creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in
order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration
(such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable
during controlled management proceedings; or

  - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only
be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its
creditors holding 75% at least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors
themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the relevant
Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de
_paiement) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation_
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing
an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial
code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended.
The management of such liquidation proceedings generally will follow rules similar to those
applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the Issuer in respect of the relevant Notes will,
in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings,
only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg
law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

290


-----

  - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities;

  - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise
authorities;

  - social security contributions; and

  - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is
foreclosed upon), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges
arising mandatorily by law.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
during the period before insolvency, or the suspect period (période suspecte), which is a
maximum of six months from the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally
adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an
additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment
declaring insolvency, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the
suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency judgment was preceded by another insolvency
proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under
Luxembourg law.

In particular:

  - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce),
specified transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the
payment of debts that have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due
by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; or the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the
suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if
so requested by the insolvency receiver;

  - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for
matured debts as well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver
if they were concluded with the knowledge of the insolvent party’s cessation of payments;

  - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and
Article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to
challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency; and

  - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial
collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Financial Collateral Law”), a financial collateral
arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into
force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and
binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators
notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg
Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such
proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not
reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the
identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the
insolvency order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so
as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of
insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the insolvency estate.
Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and on the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

291


-----

The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue
the business of the debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the
court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two
exceptions apply:

  - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

  - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes
an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of
the insolvency judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of
the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are
still to be performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the
insolvent party prior to the insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for
damages in the insolvency and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may
not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary
arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used
in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company
has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation
that any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office,
Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond
to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
“is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board
meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the
location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the
determination of the place where a company has its COMI. The time when a company’s COMI is
determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction
would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a
debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open
“secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The
effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the
territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other
Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial
proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the Issuer’s COMI is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may
have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.

**_Security interests considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the
_lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or_
security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the
creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be
located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank account held
with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors
located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through
an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over
such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in
accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity,
perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain
registration, notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral
Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an
enforcement event:

  - the direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with
a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged
assets;

  - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by
way of a public auction;

  - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured
obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

  - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on
(i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv)
the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers,
the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may
not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the
powers of any receivers or administrators, might not be recognized or enforced by the
Luxembourg courts, particularly where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction
because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main
insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under
Luxembourg law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets
located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in
accordance of Article 5 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not
prevent any third-party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which
are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid
claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors
through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain
entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of
law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments
arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the
rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed

293


-----

preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs
of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of
salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as social security
bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This
general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of
pledged assets.

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions
on financial assistance as defined by Article 49-6 of the Luxembourg Companies Act or any other
similar provisions, might not be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the Security Documents, the Indenture and the transaction
documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the _Administration_ _de_
_l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal_
proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that the Notes, the security interest
agreements, the indentures and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) must be produced before an official Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée). In
such a case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of
the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable
depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in
respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the
security documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or
German.

**_Service of process_**

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will
not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid
judgment against an issuer incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the Notes obtained from
a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and
effect after all appeals that may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect
thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent
jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur)
set forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de
_Procédure Civile), being:_

  - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the
Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

  - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

  - the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law
(fraude à la loi);

  - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matters
under its applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private
international and local law;

  - the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which the decision has been
rendered;

  - the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following
proceedings at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the
necessary time to prepare its case and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and

  - the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the
laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature.

294


-----

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the
designated law and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public
policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an
_exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Furthermore, in the event of any_
proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed
to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have the power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay in a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of
the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such
purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

# Plan of distribution

### General

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement
dated on or about, 2016. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase
Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at
which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates and agents, including
in respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer
and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in
addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Sales of the Notes may be made
through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers or through registered brokers.

Investment funds or accounts advised or managed by entities affiliated with Bain Capital LLC may
purchase Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum and in the case of investment funds registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to the
limitations of the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of Bain Capital LLC to buy or
sell the Notes in the future and, as a result, these investment funds and affiliates of Bain Capital
LLC may buy or sell Notes, subject to applicable securities laws, in open market transactions at
any time following the consummation of the Offering.

**_Notes are not being registered_**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for
resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes
in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered
as such under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”).
Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations
and agreements described under “Transfer restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers will not offer or
sell the Notes except to persons they reasonably expect to be qualified institutional buyers or
pursuant to offers and sales in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the
Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale
of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and
(ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material

296


-----

relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country
or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of
an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to this Offering, the distribution of this
Offering Memorandum and the resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract
to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in
which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by
the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable
to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**_No sale of similar securities_**

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided
under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guarantee by, the Issuer and the
Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates (other than any securities issued by
any funds managed or controlled by Bain Capital or entities controlled by such funds that have
no relationship or connection otherwise with the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective
subsidiaries or holding companies but are affiliates solely due to the fact that Bain Capital has an
equity interest in such entity) that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from
the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 30 days after the
date of this Offering Memorandum without prior written consent.

**_New issue of securities_**

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on
the on the Official List of the Exchange. No certainty can be given that this application will be
granted, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop.

The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make
a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favorable to
you. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**_Initial settlement_**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or
about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be
the business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange
Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to such trades expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or
the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
will initially settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing should consult their own advisors.

_Price stabilization and short positions_

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may over-allot the Notes or
effect transactions, for a limited period after the Issue Date, with a view to supporting the
market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. The
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also create
syndicate short positions, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in
market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty
bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities
and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the
liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Any such
stabilizing action, if begun, may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of
30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading_
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

**_Other relationships_**

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and original
lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and are or will be counterparties in the
hedging arrangements we expect to roll over and carry forward or enter into in connection with
the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates receive customary fees and commissions in
such capacities. J.P. Morgan Europe Limited acts as arranger and lender under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement.

In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in
the past and may currently be providing and may provide in the future, investment banking,
commercial lending, consulting and advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary
course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions.
Also, certain Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have various bilateral
commitments and exposures to entities in our Group.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments, securities or financial
instruments activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain
of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates
routinely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including (potentially) the Notes offered hereby. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the
transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date.

following form:

# Enforceability of judgments

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and certain security
providers are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Each of the documents relating to the
Collateral for the Notes will be governed by the laws of France or Luxembourg, as applicable. The
Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes are governed by New York law. The
Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. All of the directors and executive officers of
the Issuer and the Guarantors are nonresidents of the United States. Since substantially all the
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the
Guarantors or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated
upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the
United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in
each case in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S.
securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such
other persons mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or a security provider,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions in which the relevant company has
assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is
described below for the countries in which the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain security
providers are located, you should consult your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as
needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

### France

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of
civil law claims connected with the Notes against French entities and/or French individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial
matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has
exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex
_parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil_
court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing
French case law as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the
French court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

  - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because
the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no
international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the
French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

  - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

  - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial
decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French
law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment
that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at
the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject
matter as such U.S. judgment.

304


-----

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit
from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus
be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to
appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by
French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000
(relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial,
industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or
restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to
comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or
French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data
files and individual liberties, as amended) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of
obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign
law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties
to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to
contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French
courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities
laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance
of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign
country with French individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national
can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of
obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant
(Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French
national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a
jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’
jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced
before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contact with the dispute and the choice of
jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from
the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by
voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of December 12, 2012, regarding legal actions falling within the scope of said
Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the
French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State.
Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by
Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless
of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the
European Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a
contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving
another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid.
Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding
on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from
bringing an action before the French courts.

### Luxembourg

The Luxembourg Security Providers are incorporated and established under the laws of the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg. All of their assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore,
none of their directors or managers resides in the United States. As a result, investors may find it
difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon the Luxembourg Security

305


-----

Providers or these persons or to enforce outside the U.S. judgments obtained against the
Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it may
also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against the
Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the
United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg
court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the
Luxembourg Security Providers or these persons. Luxembourg law, furthermore, does not
recognize a shareholder’s right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Issuer. Furthermore,
a contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be
overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a
party in accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

The Indenture is, and the Notes will be, governed by the laws of the State of New York.
According to Luxembourg case law, a judgment rendered in respect of the Notes by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of New York would be recognized and enforced by a
Luxembourg court, without reconsideration of the merits, subject to the following conditions:

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

  - the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction according to the Luxembourg conflict of
jurisdiction rules;

  - the U.S. court must have applied to the matter submitted to it the proper law designated
by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered
in Luxembourg, which have not been confirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeals, no
longer apply this condition);

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must not have been obtained fraudulently, and must have
been made in compliance with procedural rules of the country in which it was rendered
and, in particular, the rights of the defendant; and

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg public policy.

The enforcement in Luxembourg of a judgment rendered in respect of the Indenture or the
Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York will be subject to the rules of
civil and commercial procedure as applied by the courts of Luxembourg. The term “enforceable”
as used above is subject to all limitations by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, controlled management, general settlement with creditors, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of the Issuer generally.

Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal
action in Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent
provisional measures are concerned. Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause,
Luxembourg courts would in principle have jurisdiction over any urgent provisional measures in
connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by
Luxembourg law.

**3.3. Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of Interim Financial Statements requires the Group to use judgments and make
estimates that can affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates made at the reporting date
are based on key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty which
are regularly reviewed. Changes in estimates are recorded as soon as they are known.

F-11


-----

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

As of August, 2016 the significant judgments and estimates are the same as those presented in
the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2015.

The key assumptions relating to the future events and other sources of uncertainty have been
regularly reviewed during the eight-month period ended August 31, 2016. Changes in these
assumptions during the interim financial period involving a material change in the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities, are presented below.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there is an
indication of the possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable
amount.

The impairment tests were carried out on each of the six Cash-Generating Units (CGUs)
corresponding to reportable operating segments as defined by IFRS 8, based on projections of
EBITDA as set out in the five-year plan defined by the Group.

Impairment of goodwill

For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs. The
CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or group of subsidiaries that are included in the same operating
segment whose continued use generates cash-flows that are largely independent of cash flows
generated by other CGUs.

As of June 30, 2016, the Group identified indication of impairment of the Heavy Vehicles
segment. As a consequence, an impairment test was carried out on the goodwill allocated to the
Heavy Vehicles segment and resulted to a fully impairment in the amount of €2.1 million.

As of August 31, 2016 no indication of impairment appeared.

Valuation of AD brand

A valuation of the AD brand is also performed separately to determine if an impairment reversal
may be recorded.

**_Income tax rate_**

For the purpose of these Interim Financial Statements and in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”, the Group applied a projected income tax rate based on the best estimate
of the weighted average annual income tax expected for the full financial year ended
December 31, 2016.

### 4. Financial risk management and financial instruments

**4.1. Financial risk factors**

The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks related to its activities: market risk (including
cash flow interest rate risks, foreign exchange risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Interim
Financial Statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures
required in the annual financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s
annual financial statements as of December 31, 2015. No change occurred in the risk
management or in any risk management policies since the 2015 year end.

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**4.2. Fair value measurement**

All fair value measurements of financial instruments are presented in Note 18 “Presentation of
_financial assets and liabilities”. According to IFRS 13, a fair value hierarchy consisting of three_
levels has been defined as follows:

- Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on
an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to assess the data that other market participants would
have applied to price other instruments.

### 5. Seasonality of operations

Due to the seasonal nature of the Group operations, lower revenue is usually expected in the
month of August and December of each year.

### 6. Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 24 and the amount of goodwill in Note 9.

**6.1. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the eight-month period ended 31 August 2016**

**_6.1.1. Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

- On February 3, 2016 ACR Group acquired a 70% majority interest in Automax Marseille for €1.7
million, with retroactive effect to January 01, 2016.

In 2015, Automax generated an annual revenue of €12 million and employed 25 people. The
combination with ACR will create a leading platform in automotive parts in Marseille.

As of August 31, 2016 a €0.7 million minority put (included in the purchase agreement) is
recognized in debt.

The fair value measurement of the subsidiary is currently in progress.

- On March 31, 2016, Autodistribution purchased 34% of SLPA (Société Lyonnaise de
Pneumatiques et Accessoires) for €1.4 million.

As of August 31, 2016 SLPA is consolidated on the financial statements according to the equity
method and a €0.7 million minority put (included in the purchase agreement) is recognized in
derivative financial instruments.

The fair value measurement of the subsidiary is currently in progress.

- On July 01, 2016 Autodistribution Poids Lourds (included in the Heavy Vehicles operating
segment) purchased 100% of EDS (Electro Diesel Service) for €1.3 million (€0.7 million net of
cash transferred). EDS, specialized in commercial & utility vehicles repair and maintenance,
generated an annual revenue of €4 million and employed 33 people in 2015. EDS is located in
Northern France.

The fair value measurement of the subsidiary is currently in progress.

**_6.1.2. Mergers within the Group_**

The Group pressed ahead with its cost streamlining plan during 2016, by carrying out full asset
transfers (transmission universelle du patrimoine) and simplified mergers as summarized in the
following table.

**Companies dissolved via full asset transfers or**
**simplified mergers** **Merging company**

€0.3 million with no impact on the consolidated net income.

APS Berwald (10 businesses in Moselle) was sold to an Autodistribution Group Independent
Distributor on January 01, 2016. This disposal generated a gain of €3.5 million in the condensed
interim consolidated income statement related to the APS Berwald goodwill net value. No impact
occurred in the condensed interim consolidated statement of financial position as this goodwill
was previously eliminated.

**6.2. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the eight-month period ended August 31, 2015**

**_6.2.1. Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

There was no change in the scope of consolidation in the eight-month period ended August 31,

### 17. Issued capital and reserves

Autodis Group S.A.S was incorporated on 18 January 2006 via a fully paid-up cash subscription of
€37,000. In connection with the acquisition of the Autodis Group, its capital was increased on
1 March 2006 by a cash contribution of €55,900,00 and on 23 June 2006 by converting a
shareholder current account of €1,100,000 into equity, thereby bringing total capital to
€57,037,000. As a result of refinancing on 21 April 2009, the capital increased to €152,598,261.
The company was wholly owned by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A. until mid-December 2015,
and is now owned by Bain Capital Europe, LLP.

As a result of refinancing transactions on 31 January 2014, Autodis Group’s capital decreased by
€4,577,947.83. As the number of shares comprising the share capital remains unchanged, the par
value of the shares has been reduced from €1 to €0.97.

On 11 June 2015, the Group’s sole shareholder decided on the buyback of ordinary shares in the
company: Parts holdings Coöperatief UA for an amount of €18,476,190.43 through a capital
decrease in the same amount, which led to a €21,523,810 decrease in the Group’s consolidated
reserves.

At 31 December 2015 and 31 August 2016, the share capital of Autodis Group amounted to
€129,544,122.74, represented by 133,550,642 shares with a par value of €0.97. No preference
shares were issued.

### 19. Borrowings and debt

**19.1. Group financing**

On 31 January 2014, the Group refinanced its long-term debt by means of €240 million bond
issue on the Irish stock exchange. These bonds pay interest at 6.5% on 1 February and 1 August
each year, and mature on 1 February 2019.

On 15 may 2015, the Group completed its corporate restructuring and refinancing by issuing an
additional €60 million tranche of bonds on the Irish stock exchange.

Taken together with the original €240 million issue, this brought the total amount of bond
issuance to €300 million.

The gross value of the additional tranche of bonds is €61.95 million, reflecting an issue premium
of 103.25%.

The conditions for the additional issue were identical to the original bond, i.e., interest at 6.5%
payable on 1 February and 1 August each year, and maturing on 1 February 2019.

This transaction generated an expense of €2.3 million. In the Group’s financial statements, these
expenses are included in the value of the loan and are amortized over its term.

In early December 2015, the Group redeemed €30 million in bonds in connection with the
acquisition of Autodis Group by Bain Capital.

Accordingly, the nominal amount of outstanding bonds at 31 December 2015 totaled
€270 million.

The Group has also negotiated a revolving credit facility with JP Morgan for €40.0 million, paying
interest at Euribor +3.5%.

### 25. Transactions with related parties

**_Relationship with the shareholder_**

The sole shareholder of Autodis Group SAS is Dakar Acquisition SA, subsidiary of Bain Capital.

During the year the Group paid management fees of €0.4 million per quarter to Bain Capital.

**_Relations with equity-accounted companies_**

AD International is a company governed by Belgian law that negotiates preferential tariffs with
suppliers for all members of the AD network. Each year, the Group receives end-of-year discounts
depending on the volumes it has purchased.

Parts Holdings Italy was a wholly-owned subsidiary until the Group sold 80% of the shares to
Giadi in 2013.

There are no restrictions on the transfer of funds with these entities or any unrecognised share of
losses, in accordance with the equity method.

**_Relationship with Autodis Group managers_**

Upon acquisition, the new main shareholder of the Company — [Bain Capital] entered into an
arrangement with certain managers of the Group (the Autodis Group managers’’). The Autodis
Group managers subscribed for shares in Dakar Holding at a price that approximates the market
price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.

The Autodis Group managers further agreed, in the same agreement, to sell back to Bain Capital,
the main shareholder of Autodis Group, the shares owned in Dakar Holding in the event they
cease to be an employee and/or a corporate officer of the Group before a certain service period
or exit event. The selling price of the shares is determined on the basis of a number of conditions
including the service period and whether the Autodis Group manager qualifies as good leaver or
bad leaver.

In the consolidated financial statement of the Group, this arrangement has been classified as
equity settled transaction because the Group has no obligation to settle the transaction with the
Autodis Group managers. Moreover since the amount paid by the Autodis Group managers for
the subscription of the shares in Dakar Holding was assessed to be the fair value, no expense is
recognized in the profit or loss for the period.

### 26. Management compensation

The key management personnel of a group within the meaning of IAS 24 “related parties
disclosures” are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and
supervising the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (executive or
otherwise) of that entity.

  - “AD” (term and design) in France under registration number 1629231.

_Assignments of receivables_

85% of the CICE tax credit receivables for 2013 and 2014 were financed with Bpifrance in 2014.
The sale of the receivables did not lead to their derecognition, and they are not therefore offset
against the debt with respect to Bpifrance.

_Bank covenants_

The Revolving Facility Agreement includes a draw stop threshold defined as “drawn super senior
facilities debt” divided by “consolidated proforma Ebitda” not to exceed 0.7:1. The threshold is
tested at the end of each quarter if more than 35% of the RCF commitments are drawn as of the
last day of any such quarter.

**27.2. Other Group guarantees**

Bank overdrafts in Poland are secured by:

- pledges of inventories for a total value of €16.8 million;

- pledges of non-current assets for a total value of €1.3 million.

The guarantees below were given by Autodistribution SA to FPLS group banks:

- Banque Populaire de l’Ouest: €1.2 million in respect of overdrafts + €0.5 million in respect of
the discounting line.

- LCL: €0.4 million in respect of loans.

An agreement was also signed with the supplier Akzo Nobel in June 2012 in which
Autodistribution commits to minimum cumulative purchases of €55 million up to 2019.

**27.3. Litigations**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de
Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is
for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s condensed interim
consolidated financial statements as of August 31, 2016 as management and its advisors
considered that, in view of the facts of the case, there is currently no likelihood of an outflow of
resources.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

### 1 Approval of the financial statements

On 31 March 2016, the Chairman approved Autodis Group SAS’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. Autodis Group is a simplified joint-stock
company (société par actions simplifiée) with a sole shareholder. It was incorporated on
18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS.

The change in corporate name of “Parts Holdings (France) SAS” to “Autodis Group” was decided
on 29 January 2015 and was effective as of 1 March 2015.

The purpose of changing the corporate name of Parts Holdings (France) is to make it more easily
identifiable and readable and to distinguish the Group from its independent distributor members
within the Autodistribution purchasing unit.

### 2 Information relating to the parent company

Autodis Group

Simplified joint-stock company with capital of €129,544,122.74

Registered office: 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France

Registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165

Further to the Group’s acquisition on 8 December 2015, Autodis Group and its subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements of Dakar Acquisition SA, a Luxembourg-based
joint-stock company (société anonyme) and subsidiary of Bain Capital whose registered office is
located at 4, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Luxembourg Findel (Luxembourg), registered with the
Luxembourg Trade and Companies Registry under number B201035 as the sole shareholder of
Autodis Group.

### 3 Accounting rules and methods

The consolidated financial statements of Autodis Group SAS and all its subsidiaries (the “Group”)
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as
adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2015 and available on the following website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost convention,
except for certain categories of assets and liabilities, in accordance with IFRS principles.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million unless otherwise stated.

**3.1** **Applicable standards**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, with the exception of
the adoption of the following new standards and amendments:

- Annual Improvements to IFRS — 2011-2013 Cycle, for amendments applicable to financial
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 1, which clarifies the version of IFRS to be used by first-time adopters;

  - IFRS 3, which excludes from its scope accounting for the formation of a joint arrangement
(as defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements) and prescribes other scope exclusions;

  - IFRS 13, which clarifies the fair value measurement exception for a group of financial
assets and liabilities measured on a net basis;

  - IAS 40, which introduces the notion of judgement when acquiring investment property.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The adoption of these standards and amendments did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

- Due to the application of IFRIC 21 — Levies at 31 December 2015, recognition of the “organic”
tax has been deferred by one year. The related restatements to the 2014 consolidated financial
statements are described in Note 3.2, “Basis of preparation of financial information”.

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following standards and interpretations adopted by
the European Union at 31 December 2015:

- Amendment to IAS 1 — Disclosure Initiative.

- Annual Improvements to IFRS — 2010-2012 Cycle, for amendments applicable to financial
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 2, which defines vesting conditions for share-based payments;

  - IFRS 3, which clarifies the accounting for contingent consideration in a business
combination;

  - IFRS 8, which provides additional guidance on aggregating operating segments and
requires entities to provide reconciliations of the total of the reportable segments’ assets
to the entity’s assets only;

  - IFRS 13, which defines fair value measurements for short-term receivables and payables;

  - IAS 16 and IAS 38, which clarify the revaluation method for property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets along with the proportionate restatement of accumulated
depreciation/amortisation;

  - IAS 24, which defines key management personnel for the purposes of related-party
reporting.

- Annual Improvements to IFRS — 2012-2014 Cycle, for amendments applicable to financial
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 5, which states that the change in method of disposal of an asset or group of assets
does not alter the accounting treatment under the standard;

  - IFRS 7, which clarifies whether a servicing contract implies continuing involvement for the
purpose of determining the disclosures required in sections IFRS 7.42D to 42H;

  - IFRS 7, which eliminates the requirement to include offsetting disclosures in interim
financial statements and clarifies when this information is desirable;

  - IAS 19, which concerns the discount rate applied to actuarial assumptions in a regional
market consisting of multiple countries with the same currency;

  - IAS 34, which defines the disclosure of cross-references in the interim financial report.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 — Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and
Amortisation.

- Amendments to IFRS 11 — Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 — Agriculture: Bearer Plants.

- Amendments to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions.

These standards and improvements to standards will be applied by the Group as from their entry
into force on 1 January 2016, in accordance with European Union rules.

Lastly, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendments which the European
Union had not adopted as of 31 December 2015:

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments.

- IFRS 14 — Regulatory Deferral Accounts.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- IFRS 15 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

- IFRS 16 — Leases.

- Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 — Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation
Exception.

- Amendment to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 — Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an Investor and its
Associate or Joint Venture.

- Amendment to IAS 27 — Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.

The Group is reviewing all of these standards and amendments in order to measure their
potential impact on its results, financial position and consolidated cash flows, and to assess their
impact on disclosures.

The Group is analysing IFRS15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” (published in 2015, to be
applied starting 1 January 2018, but not endorsed by the UE yet) impacts.

**3.3** **Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements on a going-concern basis requires the
Group to use judgements and make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain
assets and liabilities, income and expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Estimates made at the reporting date are based on key assumptions relating to future events and
other sources of uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions in a given period could result in a
significant risk of a material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as presented
below.

**_3.3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there is an
indication of the possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable
amount.

-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The value in use of the assets was calculated using the discounted cash flows method based on
the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee.

Impairment tests were carried out on each of the six CGUs corresponding to reportable operating
segments as defined by IFRS 8, based on projections of EBITDA as set out in the five-year business
plan. Tests are then performed to determine the sensitivity of these amounts to changes in the
key assumptions used (see Note 3.4.8).

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognised at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on
28 February 2006 by Autodis Group (formerly Parts Holdings) is allocated to the France CGUs. At
31 December 2014, the gross value of the AD brand stood at €156.9 million in the consolidated
financial statements. Its net value stood at €144 million.

In 2015, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue
generated over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the Group’s subsidiaries or by affiliated
distributors. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 10.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a
perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

This valuation showed a brand value of €154 million. This increase can be largely explained by
the change in the discount rate applied which was 10.9% in 2014 and 10.5% in 2015 owing to
the change of the weighted average cost of capital.

Accordingly, no impairment reversal was recorded at 31 December 2015 and the net value of the
AD brand in the consolidated financial statements remained at €144.0 million.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty
rate assumptions:

**Discount rate**

**8.0%** **9.0%** **10.0%** **10.5%** **11.5%** **12.0%**

**Royalty rate** **1.00%** **137** **121** **108** **102** **93** **89**

**1.50%** **206** **181** **162** **154** **140** **134**

**2.00%** **275** **242** **216** **205** **186** **178**

**_3.3.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. The calculation of the
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to estimate how
long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of
tax management strategies.

Recognised deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s five-year business plan
(the first year of the plan corresponding to the 2016 budget). Further details are provided in
Notes 3.4.18 and 7.9.2.

**_3.3.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations are based on assumptions as regards the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and
mortality rates. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty
about these estimates. Further details are provided in Note 23. There are no other postemployment benefits.

**_3.3.4 Value of Sup Bonds_**

In December 2015, following the Group’s acquisition by Bain Capital, the value of the Sup Bonds
was determined and fixed based on the Group’s sale price and debt.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.5 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**3.4** **Significant accounting policies**

**_3.4.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Autodis Group SAS and
its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are prepared
over the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent accounting
methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal
transactions are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group assumed control. Control is assessed as being the power over the investee
through voting rights or similar rights, exposure to variable returns from involvement with the
investee, and the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s
returns, until such time as the Group ceases to exercise control. The financial statements of
companies over which the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for by the
equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — either joint arrangements or joint
ventures.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, non-controlling interests are shown separately from the share attributable
to owners of the parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded
directly in equity.

**_3.4.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its financial statements.

The financial statements of entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are
translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

- income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under
equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred
foreign exchange gains or losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognised in the
income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are located
in Poland and therefore use the zloty.

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustment of
the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign
operation is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore translated
into euros at the closing rate.

F-49


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on
disposal and the carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in which it is
derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
following useful lives:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years

Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful lives of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified where
necessary on each annual reporting date.

**_3.4.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
set out in IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These non-current assets are amortised over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are
tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The
amortisation period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least
once a year at the reporting date. Any change in the estimated useful life or expected pattern of
consumption of the future economic benefits associated with the asset is recorded by adjusting
the useful life or amortisation method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated as
changes in estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the
income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise Movex accounting
software licences.

These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful life:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either individually or
at the level of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. The useful life of an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to determine whether the
indefinite useful life assessment is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment of the
nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

**_3.4.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement at inception. This requires assessing whether performance of the agreement
depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and whether the agreement grants a right to use
the asset.

_Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the leased asset are recorded in the statement of financial position at the
beginning of the lease term at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value
of the minimum lease payments. Payments in respect of the lease are apportioned between the
finance cost and the reduction of the debt so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on the
outstanding liability. Finance costs are recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over either their useful life or the lease term,
whichever is shorter, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of
the asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2015, the Group held finance leases under which it acts as lessee (see Notes 30.1
and 30.2).

**_3.4.6 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities are presented
separately in the statement of financial position when they are significant, without restatement
for previous periods. Assets or groups of assets are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component must either (i)
be discontinued or (ii) classified as held for sale or (iii) form part of an overall plan to sell a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group, or (iv) be a
significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. Income statement and statement
of cash flow items relating to discontinued operations are presented separately in the financial
statements for all periods presented if they are significant. Statement of financial position items
relating to previous years are not presented separately; only the components of the last period
shown are classified as discontinued operations.

At 31 December 2015, the Group has no discontinued operations and no operations were sold
during the year then ended.

**_3.4.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is

F-51

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, either individually or at the
level of the cash-generating unit to which they are allocated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or
groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
deemed to have lost some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
amount. Value in use is determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by
applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value
less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has decreased or no longer exists. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the asset’s recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, had
no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal
is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at acquisition-date fair value, which takes into
account all the probabilities of occurrence. Classified as debt or equity depending on their
type, commitments classified as debt are then remeasured at fair value and the difference
recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, with the exception of non-current
assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s
identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within 12
months of the acquisition date. After this time, the effects are recorded directly in the income
statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGUs_

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered through continuing use or
sale.

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for
the difference between the two amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

The Group identified the following CGUs:

- the sub-group formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo, Digital Aftermarket and ACR (as of
April 2014);

- the sub-group formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

- the sub-group formed by Bremstar;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to heavy vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary.

Holding companies and support functions are included in the segment result reconciliation.

Further to its acquisition during 2014, the inclusion of ACR in the CGU formed by the
Autodistribution purchasing unit, Logisteo and Digital Aftermarket is justified mainly on the
basis of the significant synergies generated in the form of end-of-month rebates and strategic
bonuses negotiated by the purchasing unit that both ACR and the purchasing unit enjoy.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the CGU’s recoverable amount and comparing it to its
carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in
use.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to the present value of future cash flows
expected to derive from said assets in light of economic assumptions and the operating
conditions expected by Group management.

An impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed on account of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_Purchasing CGU_**

At 31 December 2015, the assets tested were valued at €94.1 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €407.1 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was
performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €366.4 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan (BP) were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity test was
performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €85.4 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying

future cash flows using a discount rate of 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
test was performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €191.2 million in the
event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the
carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recognised.

performed which showed that the valuation would amount to €9.0 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 95%, i.e., below the carrying amount of the net
assets tested. However, since property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represent just
€3.3 million of the assets tested, and in view of the performance plans rolled out by the Group,
no additional asset impairment was recognised.

**_3.4.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value
through income, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, or available-for-sale
financial assets, as appropriate. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value
plus directly attributable transaction costs (except for the category of financial assets measured
at fair value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets at fair value through income_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired
with a view to resale in the near term.

Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2015, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. After
initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are valued at amortised cost.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are derecognised
or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2015, the Group had no financial assets recorded in the held-to-maturity
investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are
valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortised
cost is calculated taking into account any initial premium or discount and includes fees that form
an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as transaction costs.

F-55


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2015) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealised gains and
losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in
equity is recorded in the income statement. The interest received or paid on said investments is
recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement, as amended in 2014, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: prices on the valuation date for identical instruments to those being valued, quoted on
an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to assess the data that other market participants would
have applied to price other instruments.

All fair value measurements are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**_3.4.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred), discounted at the effective interest rate calculated on the initial
recognition date. The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by using an impairment account. The
amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the income statement.

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such
as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group
will not be able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The
carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment
of the principal and amortisation, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken
against equity instruments cannot be reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
relating to debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in the
instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment
loss had been recorded in the income statement.

F-56

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.4.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is
lower.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
year under review. The cost of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and
allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well as the transportation cost of purchases.

This method of inventory costing is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of the
fast stock turnover.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell
taking into account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to slow-moving
items.

**_3.4.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash at bank
and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and marketable securities
which meet the criteria of cash equivalents, i.e., investments that are:

- short-term;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash; and

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

**_3.4.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are
recognised over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortised
issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.4.14 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implied) arising as a
result of a past event, it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will
be necessary in order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an
insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The
amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of
any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group pays into basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on these
investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an
expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These
plans are largely unfunded. An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under
this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include
demographic actuarial assumptions concerning mortality, severance, retirement conditions and
future salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined by reference to the
yield on investment-grade bonds. Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately in
equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.4.15 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, less any discounts and allowances and other sales taxes and
customs duties. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in order to recognise
revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.

_b) Provision of services_

Transactions involving the provision of services are recorded over the period in which the services
are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that exactly discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument to the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.4.16 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, payroll costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes other than on income, other operating income and
expenses, and depreciation and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the impact of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.4.17 Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual and material events.

Other income from operations can include gains on the disposal of operations and on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating to
past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.4.18 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution_
(Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods
for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board
(Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the
definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in
the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences
existing at the reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in the statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which they may be offset.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some
or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed
at each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year
in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

F-59


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and
when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

Inventories and trade receivables were included based on their fair value.

An intangible asset in the amount of €2.7 million was recognised in the opening balance sheet to
reflect the acquisition of ACR’s customer relationships (amortised over five years), based on
assumptions including the current customer growth rate of 2%, an attrition rate of 20% and a
discount rate of 10%.

The definitive goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation is €35.4 million (see Note 9.1
below), reflecting the synergies expected to derive from the acquisition in terms of trading and
cost savings, market share and growth potential, and was allocated to the Purchasing CGU.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss
carryforwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an
expanded base in 2015.

There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Autodis Group and
which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base
(previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2014, the French tax consolidation group generated a tax loss of €13.6 million. In 2015, the
French tax consolidation group generated a tax benefit of €10.9 million.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for
recognising tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million
plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the
tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the Autodis Group tax
consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the five-year
business plan for France to determine the future utilisation of tax loss carryforwards in light of
existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognised in the financial
statements at 31 December 2015.

This exercise shows that €178.6 million in tax loss carryforwards would be utilised, i.e., a tax
saving of €50.1 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the
timeframe of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was
limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2015, tax loss carryforwards, after utilising €21.7 million in 2015, stood at €202.5
million for the expanded base and €283.3 million for the Autodis Group tax consolidation group.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse
in the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2016 budget
and the four-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax
assets after said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the
reporting date.

### 19 Issued capital and reserves

Autodis Group SAS was incorporated on 18 January 2006 via a fully paid-up cash subscription of
€37,000. In connection with the acquisition of the Autodis group, its capital was increased on
1 March 2006 by a cash contribution of €55,900,000 and on 23 June 2006 by converting a
shareholder current account of €1,100,000 into equity, thereby bringing total capital to
€57,037,000. As a result of refinancing on 21 April 2009, the capital increased to €152,598,261.
The company was wholly owned by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A. until mid-December 2015,
and is now owned by Bain Capital Europe, LLP.

As a result of refinancing transactions on 31 January 2014, Autodis Group’s capital decreased by
€4,577,947.83. As the number of shares comprising the share capital remains unchanged, the par
value of the shares has been reduced from €1 to €0.97.

On 11 June 2015, the Group’s sole shareholder decided on the buyback of ordinary shares in the
company: Parts Holdings Coöperatief UA for an amount of €18,476,190.43 through a capital
decrease in the same amount, which led to a €21,523,810 decrease in the Group’s consolidated
reserves.

At 31 December 2015, the share capital of Autodis Group amounted to €129,544,122.74,
represented by 133,550,642 shares with a par value of €0.97. No preference shares were issued.

### 21 Borrowings and debt

**21.1 Group financing**

On 31 January 2014, the Group refinanced its long-term debt by means of a €240 million bond
issue on the Dublin market. These bonds pay interest at 6.5% on 1 February and 1 August each
year, and mature on 1 February 2019.

On 15 May 2015, the Group completed its corporate restructuring and refinancing by issuing an
additional €60 million tranche of bonds on the Dublin stock exchange.

Taken together with the original €240 million issue, this brought the total amount of bond
issuance to €300 million.

The gross value of the additional tranche of bonds is €61.95 million, reflecting an issue premium
of 103.25%. The conditions for the additional issue were identical to the original bond, i.e.,
interest at 6.5% payable on 1 February and 1 August each year, and maturing on
1 February 2019.

This transaction generated an expense of €2.3 million. In the Group’s financial statements, these
expenses are included in the value of the loan and are amortised over its term.

In early December 2015, the Group redeemed €30 million in bonds in connection with the
acquisition of Autodis Group by Bain Capital.

Accordingly, the nominal amount of outstanding bonds at 31 December 2015 totalled
€270 million.

The Group has also negotiated a revolving credit facility with JP Morgan for €40.0 million, paying
interest at Euribor +3.5%.

The Group’s borrowings do not include any covenants.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

### 22 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing
these risks are summarised below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise debt to equity ratios and the financial
leverage obtained by debt.

**22.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows at a fixed rate and is not therefore exposed to any interest rate risk on this
portion of its debt.

**22.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles
described in Note 3.4.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2015. No specific hedges were taken out in respect of this
foreign exchange risk.

**22.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain
payment credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce
its credit default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment
history, past or present financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure
equals the carrying amount of these instruments.

**22.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

**22.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

The Group does not have any equity-based covenants.

**2015** **2014**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0% 2.73% 1.50% 2.54%

Managerial-grade staff (cadres) . . . . . 3.50%/year 3.50%/year 3.50%/year 3.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They take account of both gender
and age factors.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds.

_Assignments of receivables_

85% of the CICE tax credit receivables for 2013 and 2014 were financed with Bpifrance in 2014.

against the debt with respect to Bpifrance.

EBITDA of €37 million.

**_30.3.2 Other Group guarantees_**

Gobillot-Rhône sub-group borrowings are secured (SG, BP) by pledged business assets.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**30.4 Individual training entitlement and personal training account**

On 1 January 2015, the individual training entitlement in France was superseded by the personal
training account. The personal training account is now managed by a third party through Caisse
des dépôts et consignations. The related contributions — amounting to 0.2% of payroll — are
paid over to Caisse des dépôts et consignations via two training organisations (OPCA and
OPACIF). All of the Group’s entities are subject to the rules governing the personal training
account.

**30.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de
_Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is_
for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s financial statements at
31 December 2015 as management and its advisors considered that, in view of the facts of the
case, there is currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources.

### 31 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 3 February 2016, ACR Group acquired a majority 70% interest in Automax Marseille for €1.7
million, effective retroactively at 1 January 2016.

The combination of ACR and Automax will create a leading platform for automotive parts in
Marseille. Automax generates annual revenue of €12 million and employs 25 people.

There is a commitment of minority parts purchase in the acquisition protocol.

Besides, APS Berwald (10 businesses in Moselle), was sold to an Autodistribution Group
Independent Distributor on 01 January, 2016. The gain in consolidated financial statements
amounts to 3.5 M€ and corresponds to the business funds value previously eliminated in
consolidation.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

### 1 Approval of the financial statements

On 31 March 2015, the Chairman approved Autodis Group SAS’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. Autodis Group is a simplified joint-stock
company (société par actions simplifiée) with a sole shareholder. It was incorporated on
18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS.

The change in corporate name of ‘’Holdings (France) SAS’’ to ‘’Autodis Group’’ was decided on

Holdings Coöperatief U.A., and was effective as of 1 March 2015.

The purpose of changing the corporate name of Parts Holdings (France) is to make it more easily

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The adoption of these standards and amendments has had no material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following standards and interpretations adopted by
the European Union at 31 December 2014:

- IFRIC 21 — Levies.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2011-2013 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 1, which clarifies which version of IFRS should be used by first-time adopters;

  - IFRS 3, which excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint
arrangement (as defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements) and prescribes other scope
exclusions;

  - IFRS 13, which clarifies the fair value measurement exception for a group of financial
assets and liabilities measured on a net basis;

  - IAS 40, which introduces the notion of judgement when acquiring investment property.

These standards and improvements to standards were applied by the Group as from their entry
into force on 1 January 2015, in accordance with European Union rules.

The Group has assessed the taxes and levies concerned by the provisions of IFRIC 21. The expected
impact in 2015 is not material.

The Group has not applied the following standards and amendments which the European Union
had not adopted as of 31 December 2014:

- Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 — Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and
its Associate or Joint Venture.

- Amendment to IAS 27 — Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 — Agriculture: Bearer Plants.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 — Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and
Amortisation.

- Amendments to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions.

- Amendments to IFRS 11 — Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.

- Amendments to IAS 1 — Disclosure Initiative.

- Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 — Investment Entities. Applying the Consolidation
Exception.

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments.

- IFRS 14 — Regulatory Deferral Accounts.

- IFRS 15 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2010-2012 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 2, which defines vesting conditions for share-based payments;

  - IFRS 3, which clarifies the accounting for contingent consideration in a business
combination;

  - IFRS 8, which provides additional guidance on aggregating operating segments and
requires entities to provide reconciliations only of the total of the reportable segments’
assets to the entity’s assets;

  - IFRS 13, which prescribes fair value measurements for short-term receivables and payables;

  - IFRS 14, which deals with regulatory deferral accounts, applicable to financial periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

F-99

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IAS 16 and IAS 38, which clarify the revaluation method for property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets along with the proportionate restatement of accumulated
depreciation/amortisation;

  - IAS 24, which defines key management personnel for the purposes of related party
reporting.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2012-2014 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 5, which states that the change in method of disposal of an asset or group of assets
does not alter the accounting treatment under the standard.

  - IFRS 7, which clarifies whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement for the
purpose of determining the disclosures required in sections IFRS 7.42D to 42H.

  - IFRS 7, which eliminates the requirement to include offsetting disclosures in interim
financial statements and clarifies when this information is desirable.

  - IAS 19, concerning the discount rate applied to actuarial assumptions in a regional market
consisting of multiple countries with the same currency.

  - IAS 34, concerning the disclosure of cross-references in the interim financial report.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and amendments in order to measure their potential
impact on its results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess their impact on
disclosures.

**3.2** **Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements on a going-concern basis requires the
Group to use judgement and make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain
assets and liabilities, income and expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Estimates made at the reporting date are based on key assumptions relating to future events and
other sources of uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions in a given period could result in a
significant risk of a material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as presented
below.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated using the discounted cash flows method based on
the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee.

Impairment tests were carried out on each of the six CGUs corresponding to reportable operating
segments as defined by IFRS 8, based on projections of EBITDA as set out in the five-year business
plan. A sensitivity test is then performed to determine the sensitivity of these amounts to
changes in the key assumptions used (see Note 3.3.8).

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognised at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on
28 February 2006 by Autodis Group (formerly Parts Holdings) is allocated to the France CGUs. The
gross value of the AD brand stands at €156.9 million in the consolidated financial statements. Its
net value was measured at €135 million since 2011, in connection with the impairment test on
the France CGU.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2014, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue
generated over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the Group’s subsidiaries or by affiliated
distributors. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 10.9%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a
perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

This valuation showed a brand value of €144 million. This increase can be largely explained by
the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.5% in 2013 and 10.9% in 2014 owing to
the change of the weighted average cost of capital (revenue growth assumptions remained fairly
stable).

Accordingly, an impairment reversal was recorded at 31 December 2014 and the value of the AD
brand now states at €144.0 million.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty
rate assumptions:

**Discount rate**

**8.0%** **9.0%** **10.0%** **10.9%** **11.5%** **12.0%**

**Royalty rate** **1.00%** **134** **118** **105** **96** **91** **87**

**1.50%** **201** **176** **157** **144** **136** **130**

**2.00%** **267** **235** **210** **192** **181** **173**

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. The calculation of the
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to estimate how
long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of
tax management strategies.

Recognised deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s five-year business plan
(the first year of the plan corresponding to the 2015 budget). Further details are provided in
Notes 3.3.18 and 7.9.2.

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations are based on assumptions as regards the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and
mortality rates. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty
about these estimates. Further details are provided in Note 23. There are no other postemployment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Value of Sup Bonds_**

The Group holds Sup Bonds for a nominal amount of €25.5 million, whose redemption is subject
to return-on-investment criteria for its shareholders, as described in Note 21.1. They are valued
based on updated projections of the business plan and net debt.

**_3.2.5 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold

**3.3** **Significant accounting policies**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Autodis Group SAS and
its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are prepared
over the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent accounting
methods.

F-101


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal
transactions are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group assumed control. Control is assessed as being the power over the investee
through voting rights, exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and the
ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns, until such
time as the Group ceases to exercise control. The financial statements of companies over which
the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — either joint operations or joint
ventures

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, non-controlling interests are shown separately from the share attributable
to owners of the parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded
directly in equity.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its financial statements.

The financial statements of entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are
translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

- income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under
equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred
foreign exchange gains or losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognised in the
income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are located
in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to reflect fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

F-102


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on
disposal and the carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in which it is
derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified where
necessary on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
set out in IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are tested for
impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The amortisation period
and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a year at the
reporting date. Any change in the estimated useful life or expected pattern of consumption of
the future economic benefits associated with the asset is recorded by adjusting the useful life or
amortisation method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated as changes in
estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income
statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise software licences for
Movex accounting software.

These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either individually or
at the level of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. The useful life of an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to determine whether the
indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment
of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement at inception. This requires assessing whether performance of the agreement
depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and whether the agreement grants a right to use
the asset.

_Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the lease term at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are apportioned between
the finance cost and the reduction of the debt so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on
the outstanding liability. Finance costs are recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over either their useful life or the lease term,
whichever is shorter, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of
the asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2014, the Group held finance leases under which it acts as lessee (see Notes 30.1
and 30.2).

**_3.3.6 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities are presented
separately in the statement of financial position when they are significant, without restatement
for previous periods. Assets or groups of assets are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held for sale or it must form part of an overall plan to sell a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group, or it must be a
significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. Income statement and statement
of cash flow items relating to discontinued operations are presented separately in the financial
statements for all periods presented if they are significant. Statement of financial position items
relating to previous years are not presented separately; only the components of the last period
shown are classified as discontinued operations.

At 31 December 2014, the Group has no discontinued operations and no operations were sold
during the year then ended.

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, either individually or at the
level of the cash-generating unit to which they are allocated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or
groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
deemed to have lost some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable

F-104

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

amount. Value in use is determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by
applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value
less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the asset’s recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, had
no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal
is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at acquisition-date fair value, which takes into
account all the probabilities of occurrence. Classified as debt or equity depending on their
type, commitments classified as debt are then remeasured at fair value and the difference
recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, with the exception of non-current
assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s
identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within
12 months of the acquisition date. After this time, the effects are recorded directly in the income
statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGUs_

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered through continuing use or
sale.

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for
the difference between the two amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

F-105


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Group identified the following CGUs:

- the sub-group formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo, Digital Aftermarket and ACR (as of
April 2014)

- the sub-group formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

- the sub-group formed by Bremstar;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to heavy vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary.

Holding companies and corporate functions are shown discretely in the Group’s segment
information.

Further to its acquisition during 2014, the inclusion of ACR in the CGU formed by the
Autodistribution purchasing unit, Logisteo and Digital Aftermarket is justified mainly on the
basis of the significant synergies generated in the form of end-of-month rebates and strategic
bonuses negotiated by the purchasing unit that both ACR and the purchasing unit enjoy.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to the present value of future cash flows
expected to derive from said assets in light of economic assumptions and the operating
conditions expected by Group management.

An impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed on account of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_Purchasing CGU_**

At 31 December 2014, the assets tested were valued at €71.8 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €357.2 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €321.5 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €81.1 million in the event that

At 31 December 2014, the assets tested were valued at €13.2 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €24.1 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €21.7 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying

At 31 December 2014, the assets tested were valued at €143.3 million. This amount was
compared with their value in use (i.e., €197.8 million), calculated based on the present value of
future cash flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €178.0 million in the
event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the
carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

with their value in use (i.e., €16.5 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

The Group therefore recognised a decrease in the net value of the CGU’s assets: the goodwill
allocated to this segment (€5.8 million) was written down in full in addition to a €3.0 million
write down of property, plant and equipment.

€44.8 million (based on the present value of future cash flows calculated using a discount rate of
10.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%).

A sensitivity calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to
€37.0 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%, since this is
higher than the value of the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was
recorded.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value
through income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets available
for sale, as appropriate. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus
directly attributable transaction costs (except for the category of financial assets measured at fair
value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired
with a view to resale in the near term.

Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2014, marketable securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. After
initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are valued at amortised cost.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are derecognised
or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2014, the Group had no financial assets recorded in the held-to-maturity
investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are
valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortised
cost is calculated taking into account any initial premium or discount and includes fees that form
an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as transaction costs.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2014) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealised gains and
losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in
equity is recorded in the income statement. The interest received or paid on said investments is
recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

F-108


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market participants
would have applied to price other instruments.

All fair value measurements are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective
interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by
using an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the
income statement.

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such
as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group
will not be able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The
carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment
of the principal and amortisation, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken
against equity instruments cannot be reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
relating to debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in the
instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment
loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is
lower.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
year under review. The cost of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and
allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well as the transportation cost of purchases.

This method of inventory costing is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of the
fast stock turnover.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell
taking into account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to slow-moving
items.

F-109

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash at bank
and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and marketable securities
which meet the criteria of cash equivalents, i.e., investments that are:

- short-term,

- highly liquid,

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash, and

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are
recognised over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortised
issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.3.14 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implicit) arising from a
past event, it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be
necessary in order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an
insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The
amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of
any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group pays into basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on these
investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an
expense.

F-110


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These
plans are largely unfunded. An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under
this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include actuarial
assumptions concerning demographic mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future
salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined by reference to the
yield on investment-grade bonds. Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately in
equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.3.15 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, less any discounts and allowances and other sales taxes and
customs duties. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in order to recognise
revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.18 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution_
(Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods
for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board
(Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the
definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in
the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences
existing at the reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in the statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be offset.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some
or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed
at each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year
in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and
when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

**_4.2.4 Disposals_**

_Disposal of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia (PHI) and of its subsidiary Autodistribution Italia_
_(ADI) by Autodis_

The Group began talks with the Giadi group in August 2012 for the sale of its Italian operations.
In April 2013, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding providing for:

- the payment by Giadi of €4.8 million to Autodis in respect of:

  - the sale of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia for €1 at 30 April 2013,

  - the repayment of a €4.8 million intragroup loan granted to Autodistribution Italia in
instalments, with the last instalment due on 30 April 2021 (bearing interest at 4%). The
instalments are to represent 50% of the annual bonus paid by AD International to the new
trading group comprising PHI, ADI and Giadi. The first instalment was to be paid in April
2014 (the total loan granted by Group to ADI and PHI represented €9.1 million at
31 December 2012) (see Notes 7.8 and 14);

- a put option on 20% of the shares held by Autodis. This put option can be exercised by Autodis
at the latest three months after the date on which the financial statements of PHI ad ADI are
approved, as from April 2014. The option expires on 31 July 2018;

- if the put option is not exercised by Autodis within the specified period, and the €4.8 million

Other financial expenses for 2014 include a debt waiver in the amount of €1.0 million. A
€3.9 million early repayment was received at end-June 2014, out of a total loan of €4.9 million
granted to Giadi at the time of the disposal of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italia in 2013
(see Note 14).

The increase in the cost of external loans and bank overdrafts is mainly attributable to the issue
of a 6.5% bond on the Dublin stock market for an amount of €240 million (see Note 21.1).

(*) In 2013, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the brand, and was offset by a deferred tax asset on tax loss carryforwards
in the amount of €35.4 million. In 2014, impairment of the Autodistribution brand was reversed in the amount of €9.0 million.
Consequently the related deferred tax assets amounted to €37.8 million.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss
carryforwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an
expanded base in 2014.

There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Autodis Group and
which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base
(previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2013, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit. In 2014, the French tax consolidation
group generated a tax loss of €13.6 million.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for
recognising tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million
plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the
tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the Autodis Group tax
consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies.

business plan for France to determine the future utilisation of loss carryforwards in light of
existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognised in the financial
statements at 31 December 2014.

This exercise shows that €107.2 million in tax loss carryforwards would be utilised, i.e., a tax
saving of €37.4 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the
timeframe of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was
limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2014, tax loss carryforwards, after utilising €17.2 million in 2014, stood at
€224.2 million for the expanded base and €295.1 million for the Autodis Group tax consolidation
group.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse
in the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s five-year
business plan (2015 budget plus a further four-year projection), the Group deemed it prudent not
to record any deferred tax assets after said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax
liabilities identified at the reporting date.

### 21 Borrowings and debt

**21.1 Group financing**

On 31 January 2014, the Group refinanced its long-term debt by means of a €240 million bond
issue on the Dublin market. These bonds pay interest at 6.5% on 1 February and 1 August each
year, and mature on 1 February 2019.

The following loans were repaid in full at said date:

- the refinancing term facility maturing in April 2016 for €64.3 million;

- the corporate purposes term facility maturing in April 2016 for €18.6 million;

- the free shareholder loan maturing on 21 April 2060 for €50.0 million;

- the senior equity loan maturing on 21 April 2018 for €9.5 million;

- the promissory note maturing on 21 April 2017 for €5.0 million;

- the equity purchase bond maturing on 21 April 2017 for €2.6 million.

The Group has also negotiated a revolving credit facility (RCF) with JP Morgan for €20.0 million
at Euribor +3.5%.

The Dailly financing line for €15.0 million taken out with LCL was terminated on 31 January 2014
further to clause 6.2 providing for termination of the contract in the event Senior Facility
Agreement is refinanced.

The Group is no longer required to comply with covenants except for the minimum annual
EBITDA covenant of €37 million.

This refinancing transaction generated an expense of €12.0 million. In the Group’s financial
statements, these expenses are included in the value of the loan and are amortised over its term.

The impact in 2014 of the early repayment of the loan on 31 January 2014 amounts to
€5.8 million.

The refinancing transactions are summarised in the table below:

On 1 April 2009, the Group issued €25.5 million in subordinated bonds (“Sup Bonds”) to its main
shareholders, representing financing with contingent redemption at a par value of €1 per bond.
These bonds do not pay interest and mature on 21 April 2017.

The Sup Bonds are redeemed on condition of a return on investment (through dividends paid by
the Group and/or the sale of assets and receivables with the Group) of more than three times the
value of their total investment in the Group, between the instruments’ issue date and 21 April
2017. If this condition is fulfilled, the amount of the redemption will depend on the level of
return on investment, not to exceed the amount of the principal, i.e., €25.5 million.

In accordance with IAS 39, the Group remeasured the Sup Bonds at 31 December 2014 based on
revised projections (business plan and net debt) and their impact on shareholders’ equity. Further
to this remeasurement, the Group updated the value of the Sup Bonds to €1.8 million at
31 December 2014 (€12 million at 31 December 2013).

The table below shows the sensitivity of the bond valuation to changes in the gross margin
assumption.

**EBITDA** **EBITDA** **EBITDA**

Value of Sup Bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.1 1.8 3.4

In 2014, receivables relating to the CICE tax credits for 2013 and 2014 were sold to Bpifrance
Financement in exchange for financing in an amount equal to 85% of the assigned receivables.
The factoring agreements provide for the repurchase of the receivables at maturity for an
amount equivalent to their face value. Therefore, they have not been derecognised and the
related liabilities are not offset, in accordance with IAS 39.36.

### 22 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing
these risks are summarised below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise debt to equity ratios and the financial
leverage obtained by debt.

**22.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows at a fixed rate and is not therefore exposed to an interest rate risk on this
portion of its debt.

F-134

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**22.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles
described in Note 3.3.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2014. No specific hedges were taken out in respect of this
foreign exchange risk.

**22.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain
payment credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce
its credit default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment
history, past or present financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure
equals the carrying amount of these instruments.

**22.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

**22.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

The Group does not have any equity-based covenants.

**23.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
valuation assumptions used in the calculations for the periods presented are as follows:

**2014** **2013**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.50% 2.54% 3.15% 4.38%

Managerial-grade staff (cadres) . . . . . 2.50%/year 3.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They take account of both the
“gender” factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds.

_Assignments of receivables_

85% of the CICE tax credit receivables for 2013 and 2014 were financed with Bpifrance in 2014.
The sale of the receivables did not lead to their derecognition, and they are not therefore offset
against the debt with respect to Bpifrance.

_Bank covenants_

Under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Group must maintain the minimum annual level of
EBITDA of €37 million.

**_30.3.2 Other Group guarantees_**

Bank overdrafts in Poland are secured by:

  - pledges of inventories for a total value of €16.8 million;

  - pledges of non-current assets for a total value of €1.3 million.

Enssemble bank overdrafts are secured (HSBC bank) by pledged business assets.

The guarantees below were given by Autodistribution SA to FPLS group banks:

  - Banque Populaire de l’Ouest: €0.1 million in respect of loans + €1.2 million in respect of
overdrafts + €0.5 million in respect of the discounting line.

  - Arkea: €0.3 million in respect of loans.

  - Caisse d’Epargne: €0.2 million in respect of loans + €0.4 million in respect of overdrafts.

   - LCL: €0.4 million in respect of loans + €1.2 million in respect of overdrafts.

An agreement was also signed with the supplier Akzo Nobel in June 2012 in which
Autodistribution commits to minimum cumulative purchases of €55 million up to 2019.

**30.4 Individual training entitlement**

The balance of the number of unused hours at 31 December 2014 was 513,428. The number of
hours accrued over the year was 99,414 and 11,601 hours were used.

**30.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de
_Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is_
for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s financial statements at
31 December 2014 as management and its advisors considered that, in view of the facts of the
case, there is currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources.

### 31 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 25 February 2015, the Caen Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) ratified the proposed
takeover by the Autodis Group of the entities comprising Etablissements B. Machu, a member of
the Autodistribution Network and major multi-brand automotive spare parts distributor in the
Manche and Calvados regions of north-western France. This entity had been placed under an ad
hoc mandate procedure (mandat ad hoc) in September 2013 before filing for bankruptcy on
29 January 2014. It generates annual revenue in the region of €10 million.

whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its
operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matters set out in:

- note 3.2 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the initial application of the
revised IAS 19 “Employee benefits”;

- note 5 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the initial application of IFRS 8
“Operating segments”;

- note 21.1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the accounting of the Sup Bonds.

### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the_
following matters:

- As part of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods used by the Group, we verified
the appropriateness of the accounting rules and methods related to business combinations,
deferred tax, pensions and other post-employment benefits and inventory impairment, as set
out in notes 3.4.8, 3.4.19 b), 3.4.15 b) and 3.4.11 to the consolidated financial statements,
respectively, and ensured that they had been correctly applied. Where the application of these
policies involved the use of estimates, our work consisted of assessing the data and
assumptions on which these estimates were based and the reasonableness of the resulting
assessments.

- At the end of each reporting period, the Group tests goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives for impairment and assesses whether there is an indication that a longterm asset is impaired in accordance with the methodology described in Notes 3.4.7 and 3.4.8
to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methodology applied to implement
the impairment tests and the data and assumptions used, and reviewed the calculations
performed by the Group. We also verified that Notes 3.3.1, 3.4.7, 3.4.8 b), 7.5, 7.6, 9.1 and 9.2
to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate disclosures.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

### III. Specific verification

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have
also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

(IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2013 and available on the following
website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million unless otherwise stated.

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, with the exception of
the adoption of the following new standards and amendments:

- Annual Improvements to IFRSs — 2009-2011 cycle.

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards —
Government Loans.

- Amendment to IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures — Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The adoption of these standards and amendments has had no impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

The main changes resulting from the application of IAS 19R and impacting the provision for
retirement benefits are:

- Discontinuation of the corridor method previously used by the Group: actuarial gains and
losses are recorded in other comprehensive income and no longer amortised in the
consolidated income statement over employees’ remaining working lives.

- Immediate recognition in income of the impacts of plan modifications (e.g., amendment of
collective bargaining agreement), which are no longer recognised on a straight-line basis over
the employees’ remaining working lives.

- Alignment of the expected rate of return on plan assets with the yield on investment-grade
bonds used to discount the “obligation”.

- Recognition in reserves of cumulative past service cost and actuarial gains and losses existing at
1 January 2012.

The Group has not applied the following standards adopted by the European Union and
published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 31 December 2013:

- IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements, applicable to financial periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2014.

- IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements, applicable to financial periods beginning on or after
1 January 2014.

- IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, applicable to financial periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2014.

- IFRS 27 — Separate Financial Statements, applicable to financial periods beginning on or after
1 January 2014.

- IAS 28 — Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, applicable to financial periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement.

- IAS 36 — Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets, applicable to financial
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

- Amendment to IFRS 10 — Investment Entities, applicable to financial periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2014.

- Amendment to IAS 39 — Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting,
applicable to financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.

The Group will apply these standards on their respective effective dates.

The Group has not applied the following standards and amendments which the European Union
had not adopted as of 31 December 2013:

- Amendment to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions, applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2010-2012 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 2, which defines vesting conditions for share-based payments;

  - IFRS 3, which clarifies the accounting for contingent consideration in a business
combination;

  - IFRS 8, which provides additional guidance on aggregating operating segments and
requires entities to provide reconciliations only of the total of the reportable segments’
assets to the entity’s assets;

F-157

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IFRS 13, which prescribes fair value measurements for short-term receivables and payables;

  - IFRS 14, which deals with regulatory deferral accounts, applicable to financial periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

  - IAS 16 and IAS 38, which clarify the revaluation method for property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets along with the proportionate restatement of accumulated
depreciation/amortisation;

  - IAS 24, which defines key management personnel for the purposes of related party
reporting.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2011-2013 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 1, which clarifies which version of IFRS should be used by first-time adopters;

  - IFRS 3, which excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint
arrangement (as defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements) and prescribes other scope
exclusions;

  - IFRS 13, which clarifies the fair value measurement exception for a group of financial
assets and liabilities measured on a net basis;

  - IAS 40, which introduces the notion of judgement when acquiring investment property.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and amendments in order to measure their potential
impact on its results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess their impact on
disclosures.

**3.2** **Basis of preparation of financial information**

In accordance with IAS 8 — Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the
retroactive impacts of applying IAS 19R on the 2012 financial statements as well as of the
remeasurement of inventories in the opening statement of financial position of the Enssemble
group (see Note 4.2.1) are set out in the following tables.

**3.3** **Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Estimates made at the reporting date are based on key assumptions relating to future events and
other sources of uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions in a given period could result in a
significant risk of a material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as presented
below.

**_3.3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated using the discounted cash flows method based on
the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee.

The impairment test on cash-generating units (CGUs) is based on EBITDA as per the five-year
business plan. A sensitivity test is then performed to determine the sensitivity of these amounts
to changes in the key assumptions used.

In the past, the Group carried out annual impairment tests on the France CGU (including the AD
brand) and the Poland CGU. The impairment test performed on the France CGU resulted in
recording an impairment loss of €368.5 million against goodwill and of €150.4 million against the
AD brand in 2008. A valuation of the AD brand was also performed separately, bearing in mind

F-161


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that show that the indicators that
led to the loss being recorded no longer exist.

The Group reviewed its CGUs at 1 January 2013 further to the reorganisation of its operating
activities. Impairment tests were carried out on each of the six CGUs corresponding to reportable
operating segments as defined by IFRS 8 (see Note 5).

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognised at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on
28 February 2006 by Parts Holding France is allocated to the France CGUs. At 31 December 2010,
the gross value of the AD brand stood at €156.9 million in the consolidated financial statements
and its net value at €17.1 million. Following an independent valuation carried out by an external
firm and in conjunction with the impairment test on the France CGU, the value of the brand was
written down to €135 million in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2011. An
impairment reversal of €117.9 million was therefore recorded for the year.

In 2012, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue
generated over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the PHF group’s subsidiaries or by affiliated
distributors. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 11.2%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a
perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

This valuation showed a brand value of €142 million, i.e., €7 million more than in 2011. This
increase can be largely explained by the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.7% in
2011 and 11.2% in 2012 owing to the change of the weighted average cost of capital (revenue
growth assumptions remained fairly stable).

Accordingly, in a challenging and uncertain market, no impairment reversal was recorded at
31 December 2012 and the value of the AD brand remained at €135 million.

In 2013, the valuation was performed using a discount rate of 11.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and
a perpetuity growth rate of 1%, and resulted in a brand value of €137 million. No impairment
was reversed.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty
rate assumptions:

**Royalty rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 1.00% **95** **91** **87**

1.50% **143** **137** **131**

2.00% **191** **182** **174**

**_Purchasing CGU_**

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €24.5 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €146.9 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €132.2 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_Cora CGU_**

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €11.3 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €73.5 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €66.2 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €7.1 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €32.2 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €29.0 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €138.6 million. This amount was
compared with their value in use (i.e., €233.2 million), calculated based on the present value of
future cash flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €209.9 million in the
event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the

**_Heavy Vehicles CGU_**

The Heavy Vehicles activities were grouped together within a separate CGU on 1 January 2013.
Accordingly, the Group does not have sufficient historical data on which to measure the CGU’s
performance trends.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €26.8 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €27.1 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

A sensitivity calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to
€24.4 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. This would

lead to an impairment loss of €2.4 million. Had the objectives in the business plan been achieved
at 70%, an impairment loss of €8.3 million would have been recognised against these assets.

**_International CGU (Poland)_**

At 31 December 2012, the goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of this
CGU were fully impaired.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €11.1 million and their value in use was
€17.0 million (based on the present value of future cash flows calculated using a discount rate of
10.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%). The additional impairment recognised against the
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment was therefore written back. The net
carrying amount of the fixed assets of the Poland CGU at 31 December 2013 therefore
corresponds to their gross value less impairment calculated at the rates applied by the Group
since each asset was brought into service.

A sensitivity calculation was performed and shows that the valuation would amount to
€15.3 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%, higher than
the value of the carrying amount of the net assets tested.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.4.8.

**_3.3.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. The calculation of the
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to estimate how
long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of
tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2011, the Group began to recognise deferred tax assets calculated on the basis
of the three-year business plan. At 31 December 2013, the recognised deferred tax assets were
calculated on the basis of the Group’s 2014 budget and the five-year business plan. Further
details are provided in Notes 3.4.19 and 7.9.2.

**_3.3.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations are based on assumptions as regards the discount, salary increase and mortality rates.
Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty about these
estimates. The net liability in respect of these employee benefits at 31 December 2013 stood at
€15.9 million. Further details are provided in Note 23. There are no other post-employment
benefits.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2013 totalled €22.8 million.

**3.4** **Significant accounting policies**

**_3.4.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent
accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal
transactions are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group assumed control, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such control.
The financial statements of companies over which the Group has significant influence (associates)
are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, non-controlling interests are shown separately from the share attributable
to owners of the parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded
directly in equity.

**_3.4.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its financial statements.

The financial statements of entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are
translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

- income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under
equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred
foreign exchange gains or losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognised in the
income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are located
in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business

F-165


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

to reflect fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on
disposal and the carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in which it is
derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified where
necessary on each annual reporting date.

**_3.4.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
set out in IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are tested for
impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The amortisation period
and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a year at the
reporting date. Any change in the estimated useful life or expected pattern of consumption of
the future economic benefits associated with the asset is recorded by adjusting the useful life or
amortisation method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated as changes in
estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income
statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise software licences for
Movex accounting software.

F-166


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either individually or
at the level of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. The useful life of an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to determine whether the
indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment
of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

**_3.4.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement at inception. This requires assessing whether performance of the agreement
depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and whether the agreement grants a right to use
the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, inception is deemed to be
1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the lease term at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are apportioned between
the finance cost and the reduction of the debt so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on
the outstanding liability. Finance costs are recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over either their useful life or the lease term,
whichever is shorter, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of
the asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2013, the Group holds finance leases in which it acts as lessee (see Notes 30.1
and 30.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental
to ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred
when negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded
over the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is
recorded as income from ordinary activities in the period in which it is earned.

At 31 December 2013, the Group does not act as lessor in any finance leases.

**_3.4.6 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities are presented
separately in the statement of financial position when they are significant, without restatement
for previous periods. The asset or group of assets are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component must either be

F-167


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

discontinued or classified as held for sale or it must form part of an overall plan to sell a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group, or it must be a
significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. Income statement and statement
of cash flow items relating to discontinued operations are presented separately in the financial
statements for all periods presented if they are significant. Statement of financial position items
relating to previous years are not presented separately; only the components of the last period
shown are classified as discontinued operations.

At 31 December 2013, the Group has no discontinued operations.

**_3.4.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, either individually or at the
level of the cash-generating unit to which they are allocated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or
groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
deemed to have lost some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
amount. Value in use is determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by
applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value
less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the asset’s recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, had
no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal
is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at acquisition-date fair value, which takes into
account all the probabilities of occurrence. Classified as debt or equity depending on their
type, commitments classified as debt are then remeasured at fair value and the difference
recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, with the exception of non-current
assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards.

F-168


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s
identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within
12 months of the acquisition date. After this time, the effects are recorded directly in the income
statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGUs_

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered through continuing use or
sale.

If the recoverable amount is less than the net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded
for the difference between the two amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

The Group identified the following CGUs:

- the sub-group formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo and Digital Aftermarket;

- the sub-group formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

- the sub-group formed by Bremstar;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to heavy vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary;

- the sub-group formed by holding companies and support functions.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to the present value of future cash flows
expected to derive from said assets in light of economic assumptions and the operating
conditions expected by Group management.

An impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed on account of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_3.4.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value
through income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets available
for sale, as appropriate. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus
directly attributable transaction costs (except for the category of financial assets measured at fair
value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each annual reporting date.

F-169


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_a) Financial assets at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired
with a view to resale in the near term.

Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2013, marketable securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. After
initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are valued at amortised cost.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are derecognised
or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2013, the Group had no financial assets recorded in the held-to-maturity
investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are
valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortised
cost is calculated taking into account any initial premium or discount and includes fees that form
an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as transaction costs.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2013) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealised gains and
losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in
equity is recorded in the income statement. The interest received or paid on said investments is
recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective interest rate. Dividends
received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends received” when
the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market participants
would have applied to price other instruments.

All fair value measurements are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**_3.4.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

F-170


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective
interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by
using an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the
income statement.

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such
as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group
will not be able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The
carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment
of the principal and amortisation, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken
against equity instruments cannot be reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
relating to debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in the
instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment
loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is
lower.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
year under review. The cost of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and
allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well as the transportation cost of purchases.

This method of inventory costing is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of the
fast stock turnover.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell
taking into account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to slow-moving
items.

**_3.4.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash at bank
and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and marketable securities
which meet the criteria of cash equivalents, i.e., investments that are:

- short-term;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash; and

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Marketable securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds (SICAV) subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.

**_3.4.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are
recognised over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortised
issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.4.14 Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

At 31 December 2013, the Group had no hedging instruments.

**_3.4.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implicit) arising from a
past event, it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be
necessary in order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an
insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The
amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of
any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group pays into basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on these
investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an
expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These
plans are largely unfunded. An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under
this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include actuarial
assumptions concerning demographic mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future
salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined by reference to the
yield on investment-grade bonds. Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately in
equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.4.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, less any discounts and allowances and other sales taxes and
customs duties. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in order to recognise
revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.

_b) Provision of services_

Transactions involving the provision of services are recorded over the period in which the services
are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that exactly discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument to the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.

**_3.4.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, payroll costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes other than on income, other operating income and
expenses, and depreciation and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the impact of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.4.18 Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual events representing material
amounts.

Other income from operations can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and
gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on
the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating
to past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.4.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution_
(Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods
for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board
(Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the
definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in
the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences
existing at the reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in the statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be offset.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some
or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed
at each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year
in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and
when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

### 4 Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 27 and the amount of goodwill in Note 9.

**4.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2013**

**_4.1.1 Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

_Acquisition of shares in the Freinage Poids Lourds Services (FPLS) group by Val de Loire PL_

On 1 January 2013, the Group acquired all of the shares and voting rights of the FPLS group,

None of the aforementioned transactions had an impact on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements.

**_4.1.4 Disposals_**

_Disposal of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia (PHI) and of its subsidiary Autodistribution Italia_
_(ADI) by Autodis_

The Group began talks with the Giadi group in August 2012 for the sale of its Italian operations.
In April 2013, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding providing for:

- the payment by Giadi of €4.8 million to Autodis in respect of:

  - the sale of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia for €1 at 30 April 2013;

  - the repayment of a €4.8 million intragroup loan granted to Autodistribution Italia in
instalments, with the last instalment due on 30 April 2021 (bearing interest at 4%). The
instalments are to represent 50% of the annual bonus paid by AD International to the new
trading group comprising PHI, ADI and Giadi. The first instalment is to be paid in April
2014 (the total loan granted by Group to ADI and PHI represented €9.1 million at
31 December 2012);

- a put option on 20% of the shares held by Autodis. This put option can be exercised by Autodis
at the latest three months after the date on which the financial statements of PHI ad ADI are
approved, as from April 2014. The option expires on 31 July 2018;

- if the put option is not exercised by Autodis within the specified period, and the €4.8 million
loan is repaid in full, Giadi will have a call option on the 20% stake held by Autodis, equivalent
to 20% of equity as per PHI’s latest approved annual financial statements. This call option can
be exercised between August 2018 and 31 December 2021.

This business has been classified within discontinued operations in the Group’s financial
statements since September 2012. The impact of the disposal on the consolidated financial
statements is as follows:

Property, plant and equipment was valued by independent experts in order to determine its
acquisition-date fair value.

Inventories and trade receivables were measured at fair value.

In addition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the following contingent liabilities
were recognised in the opening statement of financial position:

Provision for compliance work at sites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 97k

The provision for tax risks is covered by a vendor’s liabilities warranty which gave rise to the
recognition of an asset.

Goodwill resulting from the provisional allocation of the purchase price is €2.6 million (see
Note 9.1) and reflects the consolidation of the Group’s foothold in the Rhône Alpes region where
Enssemble is the market leader, as well as future organisational synergies.

### 6 Discontinued operations

**6.1** **Discontinued operations at 31 December 2013**

The Group had no discontinued operations in 2013, excluding the Italian business sold in April
2013 (see Note 4.1.4).

**6.2** **Discontinued operations at 31 December 2012**

In 2012, strategies looking at alliances or disposals of Italian operations were explored, as the
results of the Italian businesses were disappointing and prospects for growth limited. At PH
Coöperatief’s Board Meeting on 5 July 2012, it was officially decided to enter into discussions
with a view to disposing of Italian operations. Talks began with Giadi, an independent Italian
distributor, resulting in a framework agreement the parties signed on 19 December 2012. This
agreement provided for the sale of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italy (PHI) owned by
Autodis to Giadi in the first quarter of 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of
each entity.

At the end of December 2012, Italian operations were therefore deemed to be a held-for-sale
asset in accordance with IFRS 5. Since Italy was identified by the Group as a CGU and major
geographical area of operations, and as the Group only operates in three countries, the result of
the Italian operations is presented separately in the income statement under discontinued
operations.

The net loss from discontinued operations was as follows:

(*) A deferred tax liability was recognised on the brand, and was offset by a deferred tax asset on tax loss carryforwards in the
amount of €35.4 million.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset losses of
companies in a previous tax group against profits of its former constituent members) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss
carryforwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an
expanded base in 2012.

There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Parts Holdings (France)
and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax
base (previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2013, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for
recognising tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million
plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the
tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the PHF tax consolidation group to
which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the five-year
business plan for France to determine the future utilisation of loss carryforwards in light of
existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognised in the financial
statements at 31 December 2013.

This exercise shows that €85.3 million in tax loss carryforwards would be utilised, i.e., a tax saving
of €24.1 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe
of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was limited to
this amount.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

At 31 December 2013, tax loss carryforwards, after utilising €15.0 million in 2013, stood at
€241 million for the expanded base and €281 million for the PHF tax consolidation group.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in
the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2014 budget and the
three-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after
said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date.

In accordance with IAS 32 — Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 — Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the interest-free loans have been discounted since
2009 with an assumption of repayment at the end of April 2014. At 31 December 2012, the
repayment assumption was extended to the end of April 2017, generating a €10.0 million change
in fair value which was recorded in equity since the loans are taken out with Group shareholders
(transactions with owners).

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

On 1 April 2009, the Group issued €25.5 million in subordinated bonds (“Sup Bonds”) to its main
shareholders, representing financing with contingent redemption at a par value of €1 per bond.
These bonds do not pay interest and mature on 21 April 2017.

The Sup Bonds are redeemed on condition that said shareholders achieve a return on investment
(through dividends paid by the Group and/or the sale of assets and receivables with the Group)
of more than three times the value of their total investment in the Group, between the
instruments’ issue date and 21 April 2017. If this condition is fulfilled, the amount of the
redemption will depend on the level of return on investment, not to exceed the amount of the
principal, i.e., €25.5 million.

In accordance with IAS 39, the Group remeasured the Sup Bonds at 31 December 2013 based on
revised projections (business plan and net debt) and their impact on shareholders’ equity. Further
to this remeasurement, the Group reduced the value of the Sup Bonds to €12 million at
31 December 2013 (€22 million at 31 December 2012). In view of the difficulty in reconstituting
non-observable inputs for prior years, and in the absence of previous projections, the Group was
unable to allocate the portion of this remeasurement attributable to prior years. Accordingly, the
mark-to-market impact of remeasuring these instruments was recognised in financial expenses in
2013.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the bond valuation to changes in the gross margin
assumption.

### 22 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing
these risks are summarised below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise debt to equity ratios and the financial
leverage obtained by debt.

**22.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk on this portion of its debt.

The Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap in January 2010 in
order to limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The cap expired on 31 December 2012.
The Group did not wish to take out further hedges in light of current market conditions.

**22.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles
described in Note 3.4.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2013. No specific hedges were taken out in respect of this
foreign exchange risk.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**22.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain
payment credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce
its credit default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment
history, past or present financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure
equals the carrying amount of these instruments.

**22.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012. Failure to comply with these
covenants may result in early repayment of the facilities (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA

- Cash flow/debt servicing

The thresholds to be complied with for the “Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA” ratio are as
follows:

Payment due date 30 June 2012 — ratio below 3.25

Payment due date 30 September 2012 — ratio below 3.00

Payment due date 31 December 2012 — ratio below 2.75

Payment due date 31 March 2013 — ratio below 2.50

Payment due date 31 December 2013 — ratio below 2.25

Payment due date 30 June 2014 — ratio below 2.10

Payment due date 30 September 2014 — ratio below 2.00

The “Cash flow/debt servicing” ratio must be above 1 at each maturity. The Group has calculated
and complied with these ratios since 30 June 2012.

**22.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

**23.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
valuation assumptions used in the calculations for the periods presented are as follows:

**2013** **2012**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.15% 4.38% 2.80% 4.18%

Managerial-grade staff
_(cadres) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 3.50%/year 4.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They take account of both the
“gender” factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds.

Employee turnover rates are shown in the table below:

(*) The reversal of the provision for site closures at Logisteo amounts to €1.5 million, less a discounting adjustment of €0.2
million.

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating
to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal
advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the disputes and assesses the probability that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle them.

The balance of €3.9 million listed under “Newly-consolidated companies” corresponds to the
provisions recorded at the time of the provisional purchase price allocation for the FPLS group.
These provisions are partly offset by a vendor’s liabilities warranty capitalized in an amount of
€2.0 million.

Movements in non-current provisions were as follows:


**Reversals**
