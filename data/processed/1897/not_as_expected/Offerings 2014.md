**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JANUARY 17, 2014**
**Preliminary offering memorandum** **Not for general distribution**
**Strictly confidential** **in the United States**

# Autodis S.A.
#### €240,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2019
Autodis S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €240.0 million
aggregate principal amount of its % senior secured notes due 2019 (the “Notes”).
The Notes will mature on, 2019. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing
, 2014. Prior to, 2016, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a “makewhole” premium. At any time on or after, 2016, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in
this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to, 2016, the Issuer may redeem, at its
option, up to 40% of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. Prior to, 2017, the Issuer may redeem up
to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued in each calendar year commencing on the Issue Date at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof. Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control or upon
certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes. However, a change of control will not be deemed to
have occurred if specified consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain
developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes. A portion of the proceeds of this
Offering may be used for the contemplated acquisition of ACR Holding S.A.S (“ACR”).
The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future
debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and certain
hedging obligations. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Parent Guarantee”) by the Issuer’s
direct parent company, Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S., a société par actions simplifée organized and existing under the laws of France (the
“Parent Guarantor”). No later than the date falling 60 days after the Issue Date (such date, the “Additional Guarantor Accession Date”),
the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Subsidiary Guarantee” and together with the Parent Guarantee, the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured
basis by Autodistribution S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (“Autodistribution S.A.”). The
Guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to such Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is
not so subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of Parts Holdings B.V., the indirect parent
company of the Issuer (“DutchCo”), (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, bank accounts and intragroup receivables of the Parent
Guarantor, (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of the Issuer and (iv) first-priority security interests over substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer, including a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A.
held by the Issuer, a first-priority pledge over its bank accounts and a first-priority pledge over its intragroup receivables (collectively, the
“Issue Date Collateral”). On the Additional Guarantor Accession Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-priority pledge of (i) the capital
stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S., Groupement Autodistribution Centre Auvergne “GADCA” S.A.S. and AD
Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A., (ii) Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank accounts and (iii) Autodistribution S.A.’s
intragroup receivables (collectively, the “Post-Issue Date Collateral”). In addition, if the Contemplated ACR Acquisition (as defined below)
is completed, then no later than 90 days following the Completion Date (as defined below), the Notes will be secured by a first-priority
pledge of the issued capital stock of ACR (the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and together with the Issue Date Collateral and the PostIssue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Obligations”) will
be secured by first-priority security interests over, among others, the Collateral, ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the
Notes. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the security interests, holders of
Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after the Super Senior Obligations have been repaid. The validity and enforceability of
the Parent Guarantee and the security interests and the liability of the Parent Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all
obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the
Issuer and its subsidiaries, including the Super Senior Obligations, that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such debt. The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by, and will be secured
by certain assets of, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee or provide security in favor of the Notes.
Pending the potential completion of the contemplated acquisition of ACR by Autodistribution S.A. (the “Contemplated ACR Acquisition”),
the Issuer will direct the Initial Purchasers to deposit €40.0 million of the proceeds of this Offering into an escrow account. The escrow
account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The escrow agreement will provide
that the escrowed proceeds of this Offering will be released upon the completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition to the extent such
amounts are used to fund such acquisition. If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not completed on or prior to May 31, 2014, if the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not financed by the proceeds of the Offering placed into escrow or if certain other events occur, then
€40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be required to be redeemed pursuant to a special mandatory redemption at
a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from
the Issue Date (as defined below) of the Notes to the date of the special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_
Each series of Notes will be represented on issuance by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be delivered in
book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on or about,
2014 (the “Issue Date”). Interests in each Global Note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive notes only in certain limited
circumstances. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”
Currently, there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange
and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. No certainty can be given that this application will be
granted, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop.

**_DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN THE NOTES._**

the expression “2010 PD Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.
# Forward-looking statements

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements, which are based on our
current expectations and projections about future events. All statements other than statements
of historical facts included in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation,
statements regarding our future financial position, risks and uncertainties related to our
business, strategy, capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and objectives for future
operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk”
and similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the
future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forwardlooking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent
written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf
as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, you
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. Factors that
could cause such differences in actual results include:

  - the impact of material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network and
of increases in transportation costs;

  - the ability of third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements;

  - the impact of French and worldwide economic conditions on demand for our products;

   - the risk that our customers’ financial difficulties require us to write off debts;

  - the impact of competition in the spare parts distribution industry;

  - our reliance on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks and the length of
service intervals;

  - disruption of our IT systems;

  - the increasing use of technology in our industry;

  - failure to maintain or improve our brand image;

vi


-----

  - the risk that our growth strategy may not be successful;

  - our inability to successfully integrate businesses following their acquisition by us;

  - the impact of price and margin pressures;

  - the termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors;

  - our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

  - the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and
employment;

  - the deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions;

  - the impact of higher employment costs;

  - the impact of environmental, health and safety regulations;

  - the risk of material losses as a result of product liability and warranty claims, including
claims for products we import from outside the European Union;

  - the impact of legal and arbitration proceedings;

  - our failure to comply with tax regulations and actions by tax authorities;

  - the impact of competition and antitrust laws; and

  - other risks associated with our financing, the Notes and our structure discussed under “Risk
_factors.”_

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations in “Summary,” “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of
_financial condition and results of operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum_
describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk
factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
# Industry and market data

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the
markets in which we operate and compete. We have generally obtained the market, competitiveposition and cost savings data in this Offering Memorandum from industry publications and from
surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources commissioned by us, including L.E.K. Consulting,
Kepler S.A.S. and WOLK.

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. However, we cannot
assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information and we have not independently
verified such industry and market data.

Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they
contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies
and publications we have used is reliable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
independently verified the data that were extracted or derived from these industry and
consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. Market
data and statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market
conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and
subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about
what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented
herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various

vii


-----

factors, including those discussed under “Risk factors.” As far as we are aware and have been
able to ascertain from information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted
that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such
information in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and
our position in the industry based on our experience and our own investigation of market
conditions. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you that any of these statements are
accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or
information has been verified by any independent sources.

Certain numerical figures contained in this Offering Memorandum, including financial
information, market data and certain operating data, have been subject to rounding
adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column or a row in
tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row or the sum of
certain numbers presented as a percentage may not conform exactly to the total percentage
given.

# Presentation of financial information and other data

#### Financial statements presented

We have included in this Offering Memorandum an English translation of, and primarily discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the ten months ended
October 31, 2013 with corresponding income statement and cash flow data for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012. Unless specified otherwise, the consolidated financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum relates to the Parent Guarantor, the direct parent of the
Issuer. We do not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information or financial
statements of the Issuer. The Parent Guarantor will guarantee the Notes on a senior secured
basis. Accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of financial
information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. Both the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer are holding, management and
finance companies with no revenue-generating activities of their own. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness and the Notes—Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a_
_holding company that has no revenue-generating operations of its own and will depend on cash_
_from its operating subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the Notes, as applicable.” The_
audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor, an English translation of
which is included herein, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the ten
months ended October 31, 2013 with corresponding income statement and cash flow data for
the ten months ended October 31, 2012 included herein have been prepared in accordance with
IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting,” the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial
statements.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should
consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and
generally accepted auditing principles in the United States and how those differences could
affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

Our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2011 has been restated in the
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for the year ended December 31,
2012, due to the completion of the sale of our majority stake in our Italian operations in April
2013, in order to reclassify our Italian operations within discontinued operations (see note 5 to
the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2012, an English translation of which is included in this Offering Memorandum).
Accordingly, our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum for the year ended December 31, 2011 are not comparable with the comparative
2011 income statement in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum for the year ended December 31, 2012 due to the completion of the sale of our
majority stake in our Italian operations in April 2013 and the restatement of our audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012. In the various financial
tables, including in “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information” and
“Selected consolidated financial information” and the discussions of our financial results in
“Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” we have
presented our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 on a restated basis, and thus those
results are not directly comparable with our results for the year ended December 31, 2010
presented in such tables and discussions, which include the Italian operations sold by us.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial
statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Critical accounting_
_policies.”_

ix


-----

Our financial statements are presented in euro rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may
occur due to such rounding. Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the
financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, figures
shown as totals in some tables may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that
precede them.

The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and
2012 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are uncertified English translations and
were originally issued in French.

#### The acquisition of Rougon Queyrel

On December 30, 2013, we acquired all of the equity interests of Rougon Queyrel, a distributor in
southeastern France of spare parts for light vehicles. For the year ended December 31, 2012,
Rougon Queyrel generated revenue of €14.5 million and EBITDA of €1.1 million. We have not
included any financial statements for Rougon Queyrel in this Offering Memorandum. However,
we have presented certain summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data, giving pro
forma effect to the acquisition of Rougon Queyrel on December 30, 2013 as if such acquisition
had been consummated and fully integrated on November 1, 2012, and includes the EBITDA of
Rougon Queyrel of €1.1 million derived from the statutory accounts of Rougon Queyrel as of and
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.

#### The Contemplated ACR Acquisition

Following the conclusion of a fulsome due diligence process, the Parent Guarantor has been
granted a period of exclusivity to negotiate with ACR’s shareholders with respect to a potential
acquisition of ACR and its subsidiary by Autodistribution S.A. The exclusive negotiations are on
the basis of an enterprise value for ACR of between €55 and €65 million. Autodistribution S.A.
and ACR have agreed to initiate the works council consultation processes to proceed with the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. Under these consultation processes, the applicable works councils
will have a period of time to review and give their opinion on the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, but are not required to approve, and do not have the right to veto, the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. These works council consultation processes are required to be
completed prior to entry into any definitive agreement in respect of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition. We expect these consultation processes to take at least 15 days from January 14,
2014, the date they were initiated.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated revenue of €68.9 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €6.6 million. The financial data of ACR has been prepared in accordance with
French GAAP and is not directly comparable with the financial information of the Parent
Guarantor prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. If the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed, ACR will become a subsidiary of Autodistribution
S.A., itself an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor. We would account for
the Contemplated ACR Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires
that we recognize the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingencies assumed at
their fair value as of the completion of the applicable acquisition. If we complete the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition, ACR’s operating results will be consolidated with ours in the
future. As a result, our financial results in the future would not be directly comparable to those
in this Offering Memorandum. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition
_and results of operations—Factors affecting our results of operations—Factors specific to our_
_business—Acquisitions and disposals.”_

We have not included any financial statements for ACR in this Offering Memorandum. However,
we have presented certain summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data, which
have been prepared to give effect to the Contemplated ACR Acquisition as if it had occurred on
November 1, 2012. This pro forma data has been derived through the mathematical addition of
the unaudited income statement data for the Parent Guarantor for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013 and the income statement data derived from the management accounts for
ACR for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, and then applying adjustments to give
effect to future cost and purchasing savings. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available

x


-----

information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. However, this unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial data is for informational purposes only and does not purport to
represent what our results of operations or other financial information actually would have been
if the Contemplated ACR Acquisition had occurred at any date, and such data does not purport
to project the results of operations for any future period. ACR’s financial year ends on
December 31. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus
Directive.

We expect to finance the Contemplated ACR Acquisition either using (i) a combination of
(A) €40.0 million of proceeds of this Offering placed into escrow pending such Contemplated
ACR Acquisition and (B) cash on our balance sheet (which may include proceeds from this
Offering that are not placed into escrow) or (ii) proceeds of a new contribution of equity to
Autodistribution S.A. by our sponsors. However, if (a) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not
completed by May 31, 2014, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition will not be completed by May 31, 2014, (c) any ACR Acquisition Agreement is
terminated at any time prior to May 31, 2014, (d) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed
with cash provided by proceeds from a new equity contribution made available by our sponsors
in lieu of using the proceeds of this Offering placed into escrow, (e) TowerBrook ceases to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Issuer
or (f) certain insolvency events occur, Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €40.0 million
will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds, Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

#### Other financial measures

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS (as defined below) measures and ratios, including
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, EBIT, EBIT margin, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding ACR), Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including ACR), operating
cash flow, cash conversion, change in working capital, change in working capital margin and
capital expenditure margin (collectively, the “EBITDA measures”), each as defined by us, that are
not required by, or presented in accordance with, SEC requirements, IFRS, French GAAP or the
accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We have included these measures because
management uses them to measure operating performance in presentations to our directors and
as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as for monitoring certain aspects of our
cash flows from operating activities and liquidity. Our non-IFRS measures are defined by us as
follows:

  - “EBITDA” represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax,
financial items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from
operations and depreciation/amortization expense (as included in our financial statements
for the years ended December 31 2010, 2011 and 2012 and for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012 and 2013). For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income/(loss) from
continuing operations, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial
_and other information”;_

  - “EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as EBITDA divided by revenue;

  - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain non-cash items and certain
items we believe are non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is
a relevant measure for assessing performance and cash flows since it is adjusted for certain
non-cash and non-recurring items and thus aids in understanding our profitability for
a given period. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see footnote 1 under
“Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

  - “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue;

  - “EBIT” represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes,
financial items (net), share of income from associates and other income/(expenses) from
operations. For a reconciliation of EBIT to net income/(loss) from continuing operations,
see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

xi


-----

  - “EBIT margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as EBIT divided by revenue;

  - each of “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including ACR)” and “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding ACR)” represents Adjusted EBITDA, which gives pro forma effect to various cost
and purchasing savings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize all these cost
and purchasing savings, and the costs we incur to realize these savings may be higher than
expected or may outweigh the benefits. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—
_We may face disruption in integrating our recently acquired businesses or any future_
_potential acquisition and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these_
_businesses and any other cost improvement measures we have taken.” For a reconciliation_
of each of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including ACR) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
(excluding ACR) to net income/(loss) from continuing operations, see footnote 1 under
“Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information”;

  - “Operating cash flow” represents Adjusted EBITDA excluding change in working capital
and acquisition of fixed assets, net of disposals. For a reconciliation of operating cash flow
to Adjusted EBITDA, see footnote 8 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial
_and other information—Other financial and pro forma data”;_

  - “cash conversion,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as operating cash flow divided
by Adjusted EBITDA;

  - “change in working capital” represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade
receivables and other current assets and liabilities;

  - “change in working capital margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as change in
working capital divided by revenue; and

  - “capital expenditure margin,” expressed as a percentage, represents investments in
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets divided by revenue.

We present the EBITDA measures for informational purposes only. There is no assurance that
items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that
similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations of the EBITDA measures are
based on various assumptions and management estimates. These amounts have not been and, in
certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm.

We present the Adjusted EBITDA measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as
measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt, and because our
management uses these measures to assess our liquidity and operating performance. These
measures should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

Our EBITDA measures have limitations as analytical tools. Our EBITDA measures may not give an
accurate or complete picture of our results or transactions for the periods presented, may not be
comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included
in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment
decision. Some of the limitations related to the EBITDA measures are:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

  - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required
to pay;

  - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
statements of cash flows;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we
consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

xii


-----

  - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to
be replaced in the future, and the EBITDA measures do not reflect any cash requirements
for such replacements.

Other companies in our industry may calculate the EBITDA measures differently than we do,
which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our nonIFRS measures and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations or reduce our indebtedness. You should compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only
as a supplement to evaluate our performance.

#### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, where we generated 90% of our revenue
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We also hold a strong regional position in the
Polish light vehicle IAM, where we generated 10% of our revenue over the same period. With
over 50 years of experience in the market, we believe that as of December 31, 2012, we held a
market share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle
IAM. The IAM has demonstrated resilience in recent years and currently benefits from
advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with significant purchasing power with
aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network throughout France allows us to
deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each our four business lines, featuring approximately
1.7 million spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these
parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for
light vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and
operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned
distributors to garages represented 75% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 25% of our
revenue in France over the same period. As of October 31, 2013, we had a network of 48 whollyowned distributors and 44 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors
operated out of 489 distribution sites which are supplied either by our three warehouses (one for
each of light vehicle parts, light vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts) or through direct
shipments from suppliers. We use a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operated three warehouses and 43
distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than
125,000 end-customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

Our leading market positions, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.

-----

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we generated revenue of €1,129 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €53.1 million. We are currently in exclusive negotiations regarding the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR is a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light
vehicles. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated adjusted EBITDA of
€6.6 million, and we have in addition identified €6.0 million of cost and purchasing savings per
year that we will seek to realize in large part by having ACR purchase spare parts under our
existing arrangements with our suppliers, which provide for more advantageous terms.

Of the €730.6 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
year ended December 31, 2012, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted for
approximately 51%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately 16%;
truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 10%; and equipment and
tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 23%. The remaining
€246.0 million of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was generated by sales to
affiliated independent distributors.

#### Our strengths

**_Leading distributor in the profitable and resilient independent light vehicle and truck_**
**_aftermarket sector_**

_Profitable and resilient sector_

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car park”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has proven resilient
during recent economic downturns even as new car sales decline. For example, the French light
vehicle and truck aftermarket increased by 1.3% between 2008 and 2011. This resilience is due in
part to several beneficial trends which we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a
stable car park size, a continuing increase in the average age of the car park, increasingly
complex and technologically advanced vehicle parts and advantageous regulatory schemes in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in
which we operate has led to an increase in the average age of the car park, resulting in more cars
that are beyond the manufacturer warranty period and are in need of repair and maintenance.
Independent garages sourcing IAM-provided spare parts provide value for owners of such older
cars looking for an alternative to more expensive manufacturer dealers’s garages.

According to WOLK, the French IAM, which represented 56% of the revenues generated by the
light vehicle parts aftermarket in France in 2011, is expected to remain stable between 2011 and
2015.

_Leading position_

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in
France, with over 50 years of experience. As of December 31, 2012, we held an estimated market
share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented light vehicle IAM. Our
leading position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand and our extensive distribution network
provide us with a strong platform to deliver a broad range of spare parts, equipment and tools
on a timely and efficient basis. We also enjoy a strong regional position in the light vehicle IAM
in Poland through our wholly-owned distributors in southern Poland.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive distribution network
organized around our central purchasing departments, three specialized national warehouses
and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for direct supply of spare parts
and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are handled separately from our
logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the supplier, we use a customized IT


2


-----

system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by
tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our distribution system is also
capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to efficiently handle high
volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and, ultimately, driving increased
customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution system taking into account
each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our operational flexibility and
efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of service to our customers. Our
vertically integrated distribution system and network of distributors and end-customers provide
us with a competitive advantage in France over smaller operators because smaller operators lack
our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a founding partner of
the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest international purchasing networks
for spare parts, which further enhances our purchasing power, allows us to obtain significant
rebates and complements our leading position in France by giving us access to best-practices of
other AD International partners abroad. We believe that the advantages of our vertically
integrated distribution system are difficult to replicate, because the significant time and
resources that would be required to reproduce our existing infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a very
large customer base of light vehicle and truck garages (which include independent garages, body
shops, fast fitters, fleet garages and car centers). We serve more than 125,000 end-customers in
France, including our approximately 3,200 branded garages which we service through both our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors. For the twelve months ended October 31,
2013, 75% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to garages through our whollyowned distributors, and 25% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated
independent distributors that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient
distribution network and our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on
a timely and efficient basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to
develop and maintain our large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers
targeted by our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not
overlap due to the commercial arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated
independent distributors.

**_High-quality service and highly efficient operations based on customized IT systems and_**
**_extensive product portfolio_**

_High-quality service_

Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately 1.7 million spare parts from over 300 suppliers.
Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platform allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items
and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online
business-to-business car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and
Truckissimo, respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly
order from a large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby
improving the customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe these web
portals provide us with a competitive advantage, and almost €100 million of our revenue from
sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated
independent distributors for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013 were placed through
our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services we offer
drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.


3


-----

_Customized IT system_
Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. We have recently upgraded the warehouse IT management system of our
light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the process of
upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a tablet-based
program allowing our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and to make
suggestions for purchases based on the customer profile. We believe that our IT systems provide
us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a timely and
efficient basis.
As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts and equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to
operate efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our
market-leading positions. As a result we have made, and expect to continue to make in the
future, judicious investments in IT.

_Extensive product portfolio_
We believe our suppliers view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for
the IAM, which allows us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse
range of suppliers. This is because we are one of the few distributors in our market that has the
scale, warehouse logistics and distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and
distribute a large number of spare parts and equipment and tools for an increasingly complex
market. The number of car and truck brands and models in the car park continues to increase
and, as a result, the related assortment of car and truck spare parts increases each year. We
believe that our extensive product portfolio, combined with our extensive range of services,
makes us attractive to the growing number of multi-brand garages who are moving away from
single-brand manufacturer-specific dealers.

**_Improved financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light business_**
**_model_**
During the last three fiscal years, we generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA
margin from 2.7% to 4.5%, and maintained stable cash flow generation even during the recent
economic downturn, with cash conversion (defined as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA
converted to cash) between 56.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 82.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2012. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we achieved an
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.7%. We have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement during
the last three years by implementing a series of profit improvement measures, and since these
measures were implemented, our EBITDA has increased by approximately €30 million in the
twelve months ended October 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. These
measures include: improved purchasing by our central purchasing departments and increased
group-wide purchasing (including our affiliated independent distributors) to maximize rebates;
reductions in the cost of local management and administration through the implementation of
shared services; and reductions in transportation and logistics costs by optimizing truck routes
and increasing the use of central distribution facilities. In addition, we improved our cash flows
from operating activities from €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
We operate a capex-light business model using rented facilities, and thus our operations do not
require us to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, our capital expenditures amounted to 1.4% of our revenue and primarily
consisted of IT investments, such as upgrades to our warehouse IT management system and sales
IT systems, as well as expenditures for maintenance of our distribution facilities. Our low levels of
capital expenditures (as a percentage of revenue) have allowed us to invest in our business,
maintain our leading market positions, improve operating efficiency and achieve deleveraging
through Adjusted EBITDA growth.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsors led by_**
**_TowerBrook_**
Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, our CEO (France), Stéphane Antiglio, and our Group CFO, Christophe
Gouthière, have more than 70 years of combined experience in the distribution and light vehicle

-----

sectors and have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth
strategies. Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, is the former co-CEO of the Rhiag Group, a leading
distributor in the Italian, Swiss and Eastern European light vehicle aftermarkets, and has
extensive experience in the light vehicle aftermarket. Our CEO (France), Stéphane Antiglio, is the
former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Our Group
CFO, Christophe Gouthière, was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading
distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our Chairman, CEO (France) and Group CFO, supported
by an experienced management team, have successfully implemented the profit improvement
plan. We believe that the success of our management team in completing our profit
improvement plan and returning our business to profitable growth has laid a solid foundation
for further growth and increased profitability. The support and investment experience of our
sponsors led by TowerBrook supplement the leadership and knowledge of our management
team.

#### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience, we believe that we are well positioned
to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light vehicle IAM. To accomplish
this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our sales force performance and
practices, and develop new key accounts. As part of this strategy, we are currently in exclusive
negotiations regarding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR is a specialized distributor in
France of spare parts for light vehicles. We also intend to expand our geographic coverage in the
French truck IAM, in part by making selective, local acquisitions.

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a CAGR of 16.3% between 2010 and 2012.
We believe that we are well positioned to further win new contracts with insurance companies
for our collision repair services and to channel this business to our branded garages due to our
high levels of service and lower prices, thereby strengthening our partnerships among branded
garages and insurers and increasing demand for the provision of collision repair parts from our
distributors. To this end, we have expanded our call center for our collision repair services and
have set up a separate sales department to target insurance clients, and we intend to further
develop our collision business line’s logistics platform to handle the expected increased demand
for these collision repair services.

**_Enhance customer service_**

_Logistics_

We intend to continue to enhance the high-quality service we provide to customers by ensuring
seamless execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already extensive
product assortment. We believe that the range of spare parts on offer, efficient and effective
order execution, and timely product delivery will continue to drive customer loyalty. We plan to
shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. If we acquire ACR, we
believe that we will benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its
specialization in deliveries within two to four hours of order.

_Products_

We seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to


5


-----

capture market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand
our portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line and, if
we acquire ACR, the private label product line of ACR for the light vehicle and truck aftermarket.
We also plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We believe this approach will
allow us to address different types of customers with different value propositions, ultimately
optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase in private label product lines as
a percentage of our total revenues will improve our competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources
and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations, reduce
fixed costs and increase variability in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further
standardize our central administration and to enhance our IT support in order to implement
these changes. We also plan to invest in supply chain tools and methodologies aimed at
improving our product distribution framework in order to maximize customer service and
inventory efficiency. By further enhancing existing software and installing new software, such as
the recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics
platform, we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of orders. If we
acquire ACR, we also believe that such acquisition will enable us to group express deliveries and
centralize product returns in a single logistics platform.

We also intend to further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our EBITDA margins
in Poland pursuant to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
parts IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, we believe that,
if we acquire ACR, the corresponding scale increase will allow us to further improve our
purchasing performance. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the share of purchases made
by our affiliated independent distributors through our central purchasing departments, which we
expect will further increase our sales volumes and improve our purchasing power.

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 20% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, that target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. As part of this strategy, we are currently in
exclusive negotiations regarding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR serves online light
vehicle spare parts retailers, and offers us exposure to this segment of the IAM. Whether an
order is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely over-thecounter product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to online-only light
vehicle spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts. We
regularly assess the compatibility of our do-it-yourself sales with our existing business-to-business
objectives in terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our do-it-yourself
sales on our business-to-business sales. ACR’s primary customers are online spare parts retailers,
and as a result the Contemplated ACR Acquisition would provide us with additional exposure to
this market.

#### Recent developments

**_Rougon Queyrel acquisition_**

On December 30, 2013, we acquired all of the equity interests of Rougon Queyrel, a distributor
of spare parts for light vehicles in southeastern France. For the year ended December 31, 2012,
Rougon Queyrel generated revenue of €14.5 million and EBITDA of €1.1 million.

**_Contemplated ACR Acquisition_**

Following the conclusion of a fulsome due diligence process, the Parent Guarantor has been
granted a period of exclusivity to negotiate with ACR’s shareholders with respect to a potential
acquisition of ACR and its subsidiary by Autodistribution S.A. The exclusive negotiations are on
the basis of an enterprise value for ACR of between €55 and €65 million. Autodistribution S.A.
and ACR have agreed to initiate the works council consultation processes to proceed with the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. Under these consultation processes, the applicable works councils
will have a period of time to review and give their opinion on the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, but are not required to approve, and do not have the right to veto, the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. These works council consultation processes are required to be
completed prior to entry into any definitive agreement in respect of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition. We expect these consultation processes to take at least 15 days from January 14,
2014, the date they were initiated.

Following the completion of the works council consultation processes, we expect to effect the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the “ACR Acquisition
Agreement”), under which Autodistribution S.A. would acquire substantially all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of ACR. We also expect that consummation of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition pursuant to any ACR Acquisition Agreement would be subject to relevant merger
control approvals and clearances and the absence of the occurrence of a material adverse change
regarding the operations of ACR’s central platform, and that if the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition were not consummated by May 31, 2014, the ACR Acquisition Agreement will be
terminable by either party thereto. We expect no further material due diligence to be performed
on ACR as we have satisfied the principal elements of our due diligence requirements.

We expect to finance the Contemplated ACR Acquisition either using (i) a combination of (A)
€40.0 million of proceeds of this Offering placed into escrow pending such Contemplated ACR
Acquisition and (B) cash on our balance sheet (which may include proceeds from this Offering
that are not placed into escrow) or (ii) proceeds of a new contribution of equity to
Autodistribution S.A. by our sponsors. However, if (a) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not
completed by May 31, 2014, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition will not be completed by May 31, 2014, (c) any ACR Acquisition Agreement is
terminated at any time prior to May 31, 2014, (d) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed

-----

with cash provided by proceeds from a new equity contribution made available by our sponsors
in lieu of using the proceeds of this Offering placed into escrow, (e) TowerBrook ceases to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Issuer
or (f) certain insolvency events occur, Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €40.0 million
will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds, Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

ACR is a distributor of spare parts for light vehicles in France, serving a diverse customer base
including auto centers, fast-fitters and online spare parts distributors. ACR specializes in braking
systems, rotating electrics (alternators and starters), engine environment (filters and exhausts)
and clutches and transmissions. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated
revenue of €68.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of €6.6 million.

We believe that the acquisition of ACR would allow us to grow our market share in the French
light vehicle aftermarket because we would benefit from ACR’s logistics and distribution
platform, thereby further reducing our delivery times. We would also leverage the strong and
diverse customer base of ACR, which includes the fast-growing online spare parts distribution
segment, and to benefit from ACR’s expertise in product return management and its
specialization in deliveries within two to four hours of order. In addition, the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition would allow us to realize further procurement, logistics and distribution savings and
cost efficiencies, including €6.0 million of cost savings per year identified by Kepler S.A.S., a
consultant, resulting in large part from having ACR purchase spare parts under our existing
arrangements with our suppliers, which provide for more advantageous terms. These cost savings
are derived from higher rebates from our suppliers, and are set forth in our contracts with our
suppliers. Therefore if we complete the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, these cost savings are
expected to come into effect immediately upon the acquisition of ACR without additional cost.
See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We may face significant challenges in
_integrating our recently acquired businesses and in integrating any future potential acquisition,_
_and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these businesses and any other cost_
_improvement measures we have taken.”_

**_Current trading_**

Financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 are not yet finalized, and our
year-end audit is not yet complete. The information below is based on internal management
accounts and is subject to change as it is reviewed by us and our auditors.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we currently expect to report revenue which reflects a
significant increase compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in
revenue was primarily due to acquisitions made in 2013 and the full year impact of acquisitions
made in 2012.

For the month ended November 30, 2013, our revenue amounted to €95.9 million, which reflects
an increase of 1.5% compared to the revenue for the month ended November 30, 2012, and we
generated EBITDA of €3.7 million, which reflects an increase of 17.7% compared to EBITDA for
the month ended November 30, 2012. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the
acquisitions made in 2012 and 2013. Our EBITDA increased primarily as a result of increased
volume and supplier rebates, partly offset by customer rebates in all our business lines, as well as
strong performance in our operations in Poland.

This information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management, and has
not been audited, reviewed or verified; no procedures have been completed by our auditors with
respect thereto, and you should not place undue reliance thereon. This information is subject to
confirmation in our audited consolidated financial statements and report for the year ended
December 31, 2013.

pursuant to our restructuring in 2009. See “Principal shareholders.”

(2) On April 21, 2009, the Parent Guarantor issued 25,500,000 subordinated contingent value bonds (the “Contingent Value
Instruments”). The Contingent Value Instruments do not bear interest and will expire on April 21, 2017. The Contingent Value
Instruments do not have a maturity or principal amount due, but are only entitled to receive an amount up to ¸€25.5 million equal
to a portion of any distribution to TowerBrook, Investcorp and their respective affiliates made prior to their expiration date, to the
extent TowerBrook, Investcorp and their respective affiliates have received more than three times their aggregate investment
between the issue date of the Contingent Value Instruments and the date of such distribution. The Contingent Value Instruments
will only be fully payable in the event the aggregate distributions to TowerBrook and Investcorp total €577.7 million. The
Contingent Value Instruments will terminate upon their expiration date and certain insolvency events. The terms of the Contingent
Value Instruments do not restrict the issue of the Notes nor their use to repay the Existing Senior Facilities, the EP Bonds and the
Hedge Promissory Note. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Contingent Value Instruments.”

(3) Between February 18, 2009 and April 6, 2009, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor were subject to safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde) opened by the Commercial Court of Evry. Safeguard proceedings in France are a commercial
court-led process opened on a voluntary basis by a company in which such company seeks court protection from creditors in
order to achieve a restructuring plan. In February 2009, before the opening of our safeguard proceedings, we signed a
restructuring agreement with our creditors approving our debt restructuring and our equity-financed majority acquisition by
TowerBrook. The safeguard proceedings allowed the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor to confirm and implement the
restructuring plan contemplated in the restructuring agreement, thereby reducing the impact of the restructuring on our
primary operating company Autodistribution S.A., its central purchasing departments, its subsidiaries and its network, which
were not materially affected by this procedure and continued to operate in the ordinary course of business. On April 6, 2009,
the Commercial Court of Evry adopted safeguard plans for the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor, thereby ending the
safeguard proceedings in respect of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor. Since then, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor
have been operating outside safeguard proceedings and their relationships with their creditors, which debt was restructured
within the safeguard proceedings, are governed by their respective safeguard plans. As of the Issue Date: (i) at the level of
the Issuer, when the Existing Senior Facilities and Hedge Promissory Note are fully repaid, the Issuer will have repaid all the
restructured debt governed by the existing safeguard plan, as permitted by its safeguard plan; and (ii) at the level of the
Parent Guarantor, when the EP Bonds are fully repaid, as permitted by its safeguard plan, the Parent Guarantor will remain
subject to the safeguard plan only for the purpose of the Contingent Value Instruments, the terms of which will remain
applicable in full. The Parent Guarantor safeguard plan will terminate on April 6, 2016 or following the expiration or
repayment of the Contingent Value Instruments, if earlier.

(4) On the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the
Parent Guarantor. No later than the date falling 60 days after the Issue Date (such date, the “Additional Guarantor Accession
Date”), the Notes will be guaranteed (the “Subsidiary Guarantee” and together with the Parent Guarantee, the
“Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by Autodistribution S.A. As of and for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013,
the Issuer and the Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and
loans) accounted for 46.5% of the consolidated total assets, 18.5% of the consolidated revenue and 42.3% of the
consolidated EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor. The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
certain limitations under local law and other contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of Autodistribution S.A. is expected to
be limited in value to an amount not greater than the amount of the loan(s) of the proceeds of this Offering made to and
used by Autodistribution S.A., which is expected to be between approximately €66 million and €76 million if the Completion
Date occurs, or €13.6 million otherwise, as described in this Offering Memorandum under “Use of proceeds.” Other
indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the Dutch Security_
_Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the_
_Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of_
_France and the Netherlands, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may_
_limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.” See_
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Notes Guarantees.”_

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of DutchCo, (ii) a first-priority
pledge of the capital stock, bank accounts and intragroup receivables of the Parent Guarantor, (iii) a first-priority pledge of
the capital stock of the Issuer and (iv) first-priority security interests over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including
a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the
Issuer, a first-priority pledge over its bank accounts and a first-priority pledge over its intragroup receivables (collectively, the
“Issue Date Collateral”). On the Additional Guarantor Accession Date, the Notes will be secured by a first-priority pledge of (i)
the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S., Groupement Autodistribution Centre Auvergne
“GADCA” S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A., (ii) Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank accounts
and (iii) Autodistribution S.A.’s intragroup receivables (collectively, the “Post-Issue Date Collateral”). In addition, if the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed, then no later than 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be
secured by a first-priority pledge of the issued capital stock of ACR (the “Post-Completion Date Collateral” and together with
the Issue Date Collateral and the Post-Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”). The security interests in the Collateral will be
limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to
providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Limitations
_on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging_
obligations will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Parent Guarantor and will be secured by first-priority security
interests over, among others, the same assets that secure the Notes (the “Collateral”) ranking pari passu with the security
interests securing the Notes and will also be guaranteed by, and benefit from security over the assets of, certain of our
subsidiaries that do not guarantee or provide security in favor of the Notes.

(5) In connection with this Offering, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for drawings
of up to €20.0 million, all of which will be available but undrawn on the Issue Date. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the
Collateral only after lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, creditors of any future indebtedness incurred
which is permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu on the enforcement of the
Collateral with the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements have
been repaid in full. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro
rata to the repayment of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

(6) Pending the potential completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition by Autodistribution S.A., the Issuer will direct the
Initial Purchasers to deposit €40.0 million of the proceeds of this Offering into an escrow account. The escrow account will be
controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Escrow Agreement
will provide that the escrowed proceeds of this Offering will be released upon the Completion Date, to the extent such
amounts are used to fund the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not completed on or
prior to May 31, 2014, if the escrowed proceeds are not used to fund the Contemplated ACR Acquisition or if certain other
events occur, then €40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes will be required to be redeemed pursuant to a
special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of the special mandatory redemption. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

(7) Autodistribution and several of our other subsidiaries have entered into various factoring, working capital and bilateral
lending facilities with an aggregate principal amount of €23.2 million outstanding as of October 31, 2013. These factoring
arrangements and the working capital and bilateral lending facilities will remain in place after the Issue Date. See
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Other financing arrangements.”

(8) Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. collectively hold approximately 7.5% of the outstanding share capital of
Autodistribution S.A., and their capital stock will be pledged by the Issuer on the Issue Date to secure the Notes, but they will
not pledge the capital stock of Autodistribution S.A. held by them to secure the Notes.

                   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any
existing or future obligation of the respective
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of

intercompany receivables and loans) accounted for
46.5% of the consolidated total assets, 18.5% of the
consolidated revenue and 42.3% of the consolidated
EBITDA of the Parent Guarantor.

The amount enforceable under the Guarantees may
be limited and the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described
in “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.” By virtue of_
these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its
Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In
particular, the Guarantee of Autodistribution S.A. is
expected to be limited in value to an amount not
greater than the amount of the loan(s) of the
proceeds of this Offering made to and used by
Autodistribution S.A., which is expected to be
between approximately €66 million and €76 million if

the Completion Date occurs, or €13.6 million
otherwise, as described in this Offering Memorandum
under “Use of proceeds.” Other indebtedness of the
relevant Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See
“Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the_ _Notes—Corporate_ _benefit,_ _financial_ _assistance_
_laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the_
_Dutch Security Providers may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the_
_Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk_

_not be favorable to creditors, including investors in_
_the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your_

indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain future indebtedness and hedging
obligations permitted under the terms of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu
with indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a
first-priority pledge of the capital stock of DutchCo,
(ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, bank
accounts and intragroup receivables of the Parent
Guarantor, (iii) a first-priority pledge of the capital
stock of the Issuer and (iv) first-priority security
interests over substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer, including a first-priority pledge of the capital
stock of Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces
S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Issuer, a pledge over
its bank accounts and a first-priority pledge over its
intragroup receivables.
On the Additional Guarantor Accession Date, the
Notes will be secured by a first-priority pledge of (i)
the capital stock of Commerce Rechange Automobiles
S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S., Groupement Autodistribution
Centre Auvergne “GADCA” S.A.S. and AD Grand
Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A., (ii)
Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank accounts and (iii)
Autodistribution S.A.’s intragroup receivables
(collectively, the “Post-Issue Date Collateral”).
In addition, if the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is
completed, then no later than 90 days following the
Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by a first

priority pledge of the issued capital stock of ACR (the
“Post-Completion Date Collateral” and together with
the Issue Date Collateral and the Post-Issue Date
Collateral, the “Collateral”). Amounts held in escrow
pending the potential completion of the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition will also be pledged
on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on
behalf of holders of the Notes. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Security.” The Revolving Credit_
Facility and certain hedging obligations (the “Super
Senior Obligations”) will be secured by first-priority
security interests over, among others, Collateral,
ranking pari passu with the security interests securing
the Notes. The security interests in the Collateral will
be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations
arising under or imposed by local law and defenses
generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law. For a brief description of such
limitations, see “Limitations _on_ _validity_ _and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the firstpriority security interests securing the Notes will be
deemed to rank equally with the security interests that
secure (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) certain obligations under hedging
arrangements and (iii) certain other future
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture (including to the extent such indebtedness
shares in these security interests, future subordinated
notes). Such security interests are, or will be, evidenced
by security documents for the benefit of (whether
directly or through the Security Agent) the holders of
the Notes, the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the holders of certain other future senior
or subordinated indebtedness and obligations. Under
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event
of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes,
including from the enforcement of the Guarantees or
the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness
in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain
future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari
_passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and certain_
hedging obligations in priority to the Notes, following
the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under
the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the
Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any
fees and expenses of any other creditor representative
of future senior or subordinated indebtedness
permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit
from such security interests.

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
security unless instructed by the agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility, the creditor representative
for any other credit facility ranking pari passu with
the Revolving Credit Facility or the Trustee for the
Notes, (as instructed by holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes) or any other creditor
representative of future senior or subordinated
indebtedness permitted under the terms of the
Indenture to benefit from such security interests in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement. The agent under the Revolving Credit
Facility, the creditor representative for any other
credit facility ranking pari passu with the Revolving
Credit Facility or the Trustee (as instructed by holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Notes) or any
other creditor representative of future senior or
subordinated indebtedness permitted under the terms
of the Indenture to benefit from such security
interests is entitled to instruct the Security Agent to
enforce the security. In the event of conflicting
instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains
provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail.
See “Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_
**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or after
, 2016 at the redemption prices described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional
_redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.
In addition, prior to, 2016, the Issuer may
redeem all or part of the Notes by paying a “make
whole” premium as described under “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Optional redemption.”_
Prior to, 2016, the Issuer may on one or more
occasions use the proceeds of specified equity
offerings to redeem up to 40% of the principal
amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
up to the redemption date, provided that at least
60% of the principal amount of the Notes remains
outstanding after the redemption.
Prior to, 2017, the Issuer may redeem up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
originally issued in each calendar year, commencing
on the Issue Date, at a redemption price equal to
103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
up to the redemption date.
**Escrow arrangements;**
**Special Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . .** Pending the Completion Date of the Contemplated
ACR Acquisition, €40.0 million in proceeds of this
Offering will be deposited in a segregated escrow
account in the name of the Issuer but controlled by
the Escrow Agent, and pledged on a first-ranking
basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders

of the Notes. The Escrow Agreement will provide that
upon completion of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, upon delivery to the Trustee and the
Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that
the conditions to the release of the proceeds from
escrow are satisfied, and upon completion of certain
other customary conditions, the escrowed proceeds
will be released to the Issuer and utilized to fund the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition.

€40.0 million of the proceeds of this Offering will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption if (a) the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not completed by
May 31, 2014, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the
Issuer, the Contemplated ACR Acquisition will not be
completed by May 31, 2014, (c) any ACR Acquisition
Agreement is terminated at any time prior to May 31,
2014, (d) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is
completed with cash provided by proceeds from a
new equity contribution made available by our
sponsors in lieu of using the proceeds of the bond
offering placed into escrow, (e) TowerBrook ceases to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Issuer or (f)
certain insolvency events occur.

In the case of a special mandatory redemption, the
Issuer will redeem the applicable amount of the Notes
at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of such
aggregate principal amount of Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
from the Issue Date to the date of the special
mandatory redemption. See “Description _of_ _the_
_Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption.”_
**Additional Amounts; Tax Redemption . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or a
Guarantor in respect of the Notes or a Guarantee will
be made without withholding or deduction for any
taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction, except to the
extent required by law. If any such withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain
exceptions and limitations, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, will pay additional amounts
so that the net amount received is no less than that
which would have been received in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” The Issuer_
may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any
time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a result of certain
changes in tax law the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor
is or would be required to pay additional amounts with
respect to the Notes. If the Issuer decides to exercise
such redemption right, it must pay a price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Redemption for taxation reasons.”_
**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control, it will be
required to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of


17


-----

their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
such repurchase. However, a change of control will
not be deemed to have occurred if certain
consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture.
The Indenture will limit, among other things, the

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes; and

                     - change its Dutch holding company structure.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of
significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_covenants” and the related definitions._

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for
as long as we achieve investment-grade ratings. See

# Summary consolidated financial and other information

The following tables set forth our summary consolidated financial information and other data for
the periods ended and as of the dates indicated below. Our summary consolidated financial
information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been derived
from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, an English translation of which is included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

Our summary consolidated interim financial information as of and for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012 and 2013 has been derived from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the ten months ended October 31,
2013, with corresponding income statement and cash flow data for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The historical
unaudited financial information for the ten months ended October 31, 2012 and 2013 has been
prepared using the same accounting principles as the financial information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2012 and contains all adjustments that management considers necessary for
a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented.
The consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor included in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The summary unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013 has been derived by adding the consolidated financial information of the
Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 to the consolidated financial
information of the Parent Guarantor for the ten months ended October 31, 2013 and subtracting
the consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012. The financial information for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013 has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of
operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. This information
has not been audited or reviewed by any auditors.

Our income statement as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 has been restated in the
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2012 in order to reclassify our Italian operations within discontinued operations
(see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2012, an English translation of which is included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum), and the following table sets forth these results of operations on a
restated basis.

We have also presented summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and other data
prepared to give effect to the acquisition of Rougon Queyrel and the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition as if they had occurred on November 1, 2012. The pro forma adjustments are based
upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Only a
portion of the Notes issued in this Offering (€40.0 million) are contingent upon the completion
of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, and if we do not complete the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition we will be required to repay €40.0 million of the Notes but will not be required to
redeem the rest of the Notes. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial and
other data are for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results
of operations or other financial information actually would have been if the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition had occurred at any date, and such data do not purport to project the results of
operations for any future period.

The following information should be read in conjunction with “Management’s discussion and
_analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial_
statements and the related notes thereto, an English translation of which is included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum. Our historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may
be expected for any future period.

Our management believes that EBITDA is meaningful for investors because it provides an analysis of our operating results,
profitability and ability to service debt and because EBITDA is used by our chief operating decision-makers to track our
business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets, and make important business decisions. EBITDA is also a
measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. The
definition of EBITDA may vary from company to company. EBITDA is not a measure of performance under IFRS and you
should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to (a) operating income or profit for the period as a measure of our operating
performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash
needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. For a description of the
limitations of EBITDA as a financial measure, see “Presentation of financial information and other data—Other financial
_measures.”_

EBIT represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, financial items (net), share of income from
associates and other income/(expenses) from operations. Our management believes that EBIT is meaningful for investors
because it provides an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBIT is used by
our chief operating decision-makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets, and make
important business decisions. EBIT is also a measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other
interested parties in our industry. The definition of “EBIT” may vary from company to company. EBIT is not a measure of
performance under IFRS and you should not consider EBIT as an alternative to (a) operating income or profit for the period as
a measure of our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our
ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. For
a description of the limitations of EBIT as a financial measure, see “Presentation of financial information and other
_data—Other financial measures.”_

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted for certain taxes, non-recurring and/or non-cash costs identified in the table
below. For a description of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, see “Presentation of financial
_information and other data—Other financial measures.”_

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding ACR) represents Adjusted EBITDA, giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of
Rougon Queyrel on December 30, 2013 as if such acquisition had been consummated and fully integrated on November 1,
2012, which pro forma effect results from the EBITDA of Rougon Queyrel of €1.1 million derived from the statutory accounts
of Rougon Queyrel as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, which we believe on the basis of our due
diligence, is representative of Rougon Queyrel’s results for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013.

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including ACR) represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding ACR), giving pro forma effect
to the acquisition of ACR as if such acquisition had been consummated and fully integrated on November 1, 2012, which pro
forma effect results from:

- the adjusted EBITDA of ACR, which consists of (i) the EBITDA of ACR of €4.4 million, which has been derived from the
unaudited consolidated management accounts of ACR as of and for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013 and
(ii) adjustments in respect of (a) the relocation of ACR’s central logistics platform to a larger and more efficient logistics
platform, which resulted in increased personnel, equipment rental and transport costs and consultancy fees (€0.6 million),
(b) staff reductions due to the increased productivity of ACR’s new central logistics platform (€0.9 million) and (c) the
transition from a dual to a single CEO governance structure (€0.7 million); and

- giving effect to €6.0 million of identified cost savings per year resulting in large part from having ACR purchase spare parts
under our existing arrangements with our suppliers, which provide for more advantageous terms. These cost savings are
derived from higher rebates from our suppliers, and are set forth in our contracts with our suppliers. Therefore, if we
complete the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, these cost savings are expected to come into effect immediately upon the
completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition without additional cost. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_business—We may face significant challenges in integrating our recently acquired businesses and in integrating any future_
_potential acquisition, and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these businesses and any other cost_
_improvement measures we have taken.”_

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding ACR) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (including ACR) are presented for informational
purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had the acquisitions of Rougon
Queyrel and/or ACR occurred on November 1, 2012. The calculations of the EBITDA of Rougon Queyrel and of the adjusted
EBITDA of ACR are based in part on management estimates, due diligence reviews and the unaudited internal management
accounts of Rougon Queyrel and ACR, respectively. These numbers have not been audited and are not derived from accounts
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The EBITDA of Rougon Queyrel and the adjusted EBITDA of ACR are included in this
Offering Memorandum as we believe that they provide useful measures of our potential results of operations after giving
effect to the acquisition of Rougon Queyrel and to the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, respectively. However, this
information does not constitute measures of performance under IFRS or French GAAP and you should not consider EBITDA of
Rougon Queyrel or adjusted EBITDA of ACR as an alternative to (a) operating income or profit for the period as a measure of
Rougon Queyrel’s, ACR’s or our operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a
measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting
principles. Results indicated by these measures may not be realised, and funds depicted by these measures may not be
available for management’s discretionary use if such results are not realized.

due to seasonal working capital effects on our business. Inventory and trade receivables levels are significantly higher in
October than in December due to high levels of activity in the months of September and October. In addition, our
operating cash flows were impacted by certain one-off items, such as delays in payments from customers affecting our
cash conversion ratio for the ten months ended December 31, 2013, as well as an increase in inventory as of October 31,
2013 due to the implementation of a new inventory management system in December 2013.

(9) Pro forma net financial debt (including ACR) represents total financial debt less available adjusted pro forma cash and cash
equivalents, and excludes accrued interest, assuming that the acquisition of ACR is completed.

(10) Pro forma net cash interest expense (including ACR) represents our net interest expense for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, as adjusted, as if the Notes had been issued and the proceeds therefrom would have been used to effect
the Transactions as set forth in “Use of proceeds” on November 1, 2012. Pro forma net cash interest expense includes
commitment fees on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility but does not include any charges related to debt issuance costs in
connection with this Offering. Pro forma cash interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issuance of the Notes occurred on the date
assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our financial condition at any future
date.

(11) Pro forma net financial debt (excluding ACR) represents total financial debt less available adjusted pro forma cash and cash
equivalents, and excludes accrued interest, assuming that the acquisition of ACR is not completed.

(12) Pro forma net cash interest expense (excluding ACR) represents our net interest expense for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, as adjusted, as if the Notes had been issued and the proceeds therefrom would have been used to effect
the Refinancing as set forth in “Use of proceeds” on November 1, 2012 (but not the acquisition of ACR). Pro forma net cash
interest expense includes commitment fees on the undrawn Revolving Credit Facility but does not include any charges related
to debt issuance costs in connection with this Offering. Pro forma cash interest expense has been presented for illustrative
purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the issuance of the
Notes occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expenses for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date.

# Risk factors

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering carefully, in_
_light of the circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below_
_before investing in the Notes. If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business,_
_results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected and,_
_accordingly, the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or_
_part of any investment in the Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented does not_
_necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the_
_individual risk factors. Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the_
_only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we_
_currently consider to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_results of operations, financial condition or prospects._

#### Risks related to our business

**_Material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network, or significant_**
**_increases in transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As of October 31, 2013, our distribution network infrastructure in France was comprised of our
central purchasing departments, three warehouses (one for each of light vehicle parts, light
vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts), connected to 48 wholly-owned distributors
(operating 311 sites) and 44 affiliated independent distributors (operating 178 sites). For the
twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we delivered approximately 35% of products sold in
France to both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors through our three
warehouses. The remaining 65% of products sold in France were delivered directly to our
distributors by spare parts manufacturers. In Poland, we operated three warehouses and
43 distribution sites. Furthermore, we rely on road transportation for the prompt transfer of the
products that we distribute from our warehouses or distribution sites directly to our customers.

A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites in France or Poland or to
our transportation network caused, for example, by weather-related problems, employee strikes,
lock-outs and inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events, could affect our
ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner or at all, which, in turn, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any damages that may arise or to
compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption of our operations.

We are dependent on third parties for the transportation of orders, and this service could be
disrupted. In the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, transportation costs accounted for
3.5% of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time,
particularly in connection with oil prices, and increased transportation costs could result in
reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of
transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and are dependent on the ability_**
**_of our third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements._**

We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and, therefore, rely on over
300 third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts and equipment
and tools that are essential to our business. Our business and, ultimately, our results of
operations are dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us with such products. Our suppliers
may fail to meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply with our
quality requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may
in the future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production
difficulties, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in
manufacturing costs or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their
production.

28


-----

Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including
closures of one of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical
breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, financial distress or bankruptcy, as well as
political upheaval, adverse economic events or logistical complications, due to weather, natural
disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing, or other events. Any short-term or
prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that
one or more of our major suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties, and we are
unable to secure alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially beneficial terms, we
may experience inventory shortages which could result in unfilled customer orders and lost
revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery method, as well as damage to our business
reputation.

If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our
presently agreed terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at
favorable prices, our margins will likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if there is
a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a significant increase in
customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or procure in
time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

**_Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic conditions in France and worldwide._**

The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by economic
conditions in France and our other markets, and our business is impacted by growth in the French
economy. The light vehicle spare parts aftermarket tends to be affected in the early period of a
recession, when end-customers delay the maintenance of their light vehicles. The truck spare
parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket, due to the
correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic conditions. Simultaneously,
de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which may cause a short- to
medium-term decrease in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck spare parts. France is our
principal geographic market, representing 90% of our revenue in the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle IAM, where
we generated 10% of our revenue over the same period. Economic uncertainty, globally and in
France, could decrease consumer confidence and consumer and business spending on vehicle
maintenance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength
of a subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in France. If the light vehicle and truck spare
parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to these economic effects, it could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, concerns
that the eurozone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national
currencies in one or more eurozone countries or, in particularly dire circumstances, the
abandonment of the euro. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more
eurozone countries and/or the abandonment of the euro as a currency could have major negative
effects on both our existing contractual arrangements and the fulfillment of obligations by us,
our product suppliers or our customers.

We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in
forms of increased employee costs and increased costs of operational costs. Any failure to pass
such increases in costs on to our customers could impact our results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Financial difficulties of our customers may require us to write off debts._**

Across each of our business lines, we rely on the ability of our customers to pay for the products
that we distribute. If a customer undergoes financial difficulties, payments can be significantly
delayed and ultimately we may not be able to collect amounts payable to us under our
agreements, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and
amounts past due. However, there can be no assurance that such reserves are sufficiently large

29


-----

for the credit risks we face, particularly in relation to our affiliated independent distributors.
Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would adversely impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Our industry is highly competitive._**

We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of
spare parts distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented French and Polish spare parts
aftermarket in which we operate. We primarily compete on the basis of product availability,
delivery lead time, quality of service, product range and technical support. Our main competitors
are other light vehicle and truck spare part distributors in France (such as Groupauto) and in
Poland (such as Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union Polska), as well as new online light vehicle
and truck spare parts distributors, which mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We
believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before making a
purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price. Over time, online light
vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adapt our business-to-business distribution and
logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare parts they sell. Further, in
certain countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged that primarily compete on the
basis of price and offer lower prices for the spare parts that they sell, and such low-cost discount
distributors may decide to enter the French market. In addition, our competitors that currently
purchase spare parts from suppliers on a decentralized basis may consolidate their purchasing
functions across their various operations, subsidiaries or owned or affiliated distributors, and
their purchasing scale may enable them to purchase spare parts at prices that are lower than we
can obtain. As a result they may be able to offer certain spare parts to customers at lower prices
than we can. Our failure to adapt to these or other changes in the competitive landscape could
result in a low profit margin, decreased revenue and loss of market share and could therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers also compete with car dealers such as Peugeot and Renault. Car dealers typically
specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero to four years old and capture a large share of
light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car dealers, however, have
extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term
service programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly
expand (for example, as a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their
warranties beyond the current limits, especially for replacement parts and maintenance items,
these replacements and maintenance parts covered by such extended warranties would likely be
performed by car dealers instead of us.

**_Our sales depend on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France_**
**_and the length of service intervals._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, number and mileage of
light vehicles and trucks used in France and the length of service intervals. As light vehicles and
trucks get older, expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase.
Consequently, a decline in the age of light vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand
for the products that we distribute and our services. We consider our core market to be light
vehicle and trucks aged over four years. We also believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are
currently being made at a later date and to a lesser extent. The technological and qualitative
improvements of many light vehicle and truck components can lead to a decrease in demand for
light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, to stimulate new light vehicle sales in connection with the ongoing global economic
crisis, the French government has introduced a scrappage scheme (prime à la casse) to promote
the replacement of old vehicles with modern vehicles and to improve emission standards. Decree
n°2007-1873 of December 26, 2007 fixed the amount of an environmental bonus granted to any
person having its registered address or an establishment in France based on carbon dioxide
(“CO2”) emissions from new cars registered in France within two years. Such bonus was increased
by €300 (the “super-bonus”) when the registration of the new car was accompanied by the
destruction of another car older than 15 years and owned by the beneficiary of the super-bonus.
Decree n°2009-66 of January 19, 2009 has since amended Decree n°2007-1873 of December 26,
2007 and has introduced a fixed scrappage bonus of €1,000 granted to any person having its

30


-----

registered address or an establishment in France upon the registration by such person of a new
car emitting less than 160 g/km of CO2 accompanied by the destruction of a car at least ten years
old. This scrappage bonus was increased for even better emission standards (€5,000 for cars with
less than 60 g/km of CO2). The scrappage bonus was initially applicable to cars ordered between
December 4, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The scrappage bonus was gradually reduced to €500
and maintained under certain conditions until December 31, 2010 by Decree n°2009-1581 of
December 18, 2009. The bonus was completely phased out for any car ordered after
December 31, 2010 or invoiced after March 31, 2011. However, the bonus of €300 to €200 is still
applicable with respect to any car invoiced after January 1, 2012. These measures have had an
impact on the average age of the light vehicles on the road and have resulted in a decrease in
the demand for the products we distribute, because newer light vehicle models typically require
fewer repairs. Similar governmental incentive plans may be implemented in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle
spare parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in
economic conditions, environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs
and the introduction of a road charge for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits in
cities could reduce light vehicle and truck spending. Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting
behavior (for example, through the increased use of public transport or light vehicle sharing) or
continuing urbanization could decrease the average mileage of light vehicles and demand for
the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in demand could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Disruptions in our IT systems could adversely affect our operating results._**

The software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party software companies facilitates
our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other management and
financial information and to provide management with current inventory levels at our
warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the
availability of any particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend
on the continuous availability and reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the
functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore, subject to operational risks such as the
occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful conduct by third parties. The
performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to effectively
safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to
telecommunication services and from computer viruses. The occurrence of any such events, and
any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services may impair our ability
to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and
to provide management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

For example, we have recently upgraded the warehouse IT management system of our light
vehicle logistics platform in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. The implementation
of new IT systems may cause organizational disruptions within our Group. In addition, there can
be no assurance that our new warehouse IT management system, or any future IT systems, will
deliver the projected efficiencies.

One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The
implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption
to our existing computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the
implementation of expanded capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our
online sales and/or our business reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid interruptions or disruptions of
such systems. Any failure or inability to maintain and upgrade our IT systems may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and, financial condition.

31

**_Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative
improvements in new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is
characterized by frequent technical advances and increases in the complexity of existing
components. Certain light vehicle and truck spare parts may feature complex or innovative
technology that can only be maintained by persons with special training or at specialized
garages. This technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation
to a particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air
conditioning systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages
that are the primary end-users of the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the
information and training necessary to maintain the complex technology featured in our endcustomers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be available at
car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the
sophisticated equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in
higher costs or higher capital expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases it may
no longer be economically feasible for independent garages to offer repair services for particular
light vehicle and truck models or spare parts. Further, sophisticated manufacturing technology
for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their quality and reduces the number of
replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are replaced less
frequently, our revenue could decrease.

The IAM in which we operate differs from the original equipment supplier aftermarket segment
(“OES”), in which operators are linked to the light vehicle manufacturers who directly supply
them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and repair procedures.
Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks,
independent garages are required to gain appropriate technical expertise in newly developed
components. The failure of independent garages to gain the appropriate technical expertise, or
access to the tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand, may
result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by car dealers with
the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small portion of our revenues),
which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and_**
**_enhance our brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient_**
**_number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute._**

We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success
of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand are integral
to the success of our business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require
us to make further investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website
operations. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success
of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good customer
experiences. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our
public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may be
diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient
delivery of quality products, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all
of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we
experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any failure to maintain a
strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, we distribute products to approximately 3,200 branded garages
and 44 affiliated independent distributors that have entered into affiliation agreements with us,
but whom we do not control. Accordingly, these branded garages and affiliated independent
distributors may take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and reputation.

Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD and Auto
Primo, Autossimo, AD PL, ISOTECH and the “AD” logo are key assets of our business. See
“Business—Intellectual property.” We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent
laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but we cannot assure you that the
actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation or

32


-----

challenges to our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not
be necessary in order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend
ourselves against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action
or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks,
which could, in turn, lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our growth strategy will require us to expand and improve our operations, and risks associated_**
**_with our expansion plans may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Our growth strategy includes, among others, strengthening our market position in France. We
may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or selected
acquisitions. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including paying too high a purchase price or the
assumption of unexpected liabilities. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions
may depend on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds
necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Our failure
to identify suitable acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. In
addition, the integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel,
particularly in respect of businesses operating in adjacent markets, could be more difficult and
time-consuming than anticipated, which could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key
employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings.

Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will
require that we continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other
logistics management capabilities, as well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We
will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our information and distribution systems,
controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing new systems, controls and
procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present
challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to
continually evaluate whether personnel with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are
properly allocated in accordance with our growth strategy, and any failure to allocate such
personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth strategy.

Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will
need to make in the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of
our supply chain and make us unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and
new market trends as we have been able to do historically. We may not be able to anticipate
all of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel,
systems, controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands could
materially adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our
growth strategy.

**_We may face significant challenges in integrating our recently acquired businesses and in_**
**_integrating any future potential acquisition, and may be unable to realize the expected savings_**
**_from these businesses and any other cost improvement measures we have taken._**

We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our recently acquired
businesses as well as in integrating any future potential acquisition, particularly ACR, if we
complete the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. The integration of recently acquired businesses and
any future potential acquisition will require the dedication of management resources that may
temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integration could also
interrupt our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our combined business,
financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot successfully integrate acquired
businesses or any future potential acquisition within a reasonable time following its acquisition,
we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits thereof. In connection with
the integration of recently acquired businesses or integrating any future potential acquisition
into our existing operating structure, we will seek to realize purchasing and cost savings.

33


-----

Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement these
measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the
planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be
beyond our control. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these projects
proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned
and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the expected
benefits from our cost measures. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or
competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the benefits of the cost measures that
we have assumed that we will be able to retain in the calculation of both Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA (including ACR) and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (excluding ACR). Also, cost efficiencies
from expected improved logistics and distribution processes may not be sustainable due to
changes in customer needs, environmental law, logistics, transportation costs or other cost
variables. Our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss
of key customers and suppliers. Our inability to realize the anticipated cost savings and revenue
enhancements from the acquisition of Rougon Queyrel, the Contemplated ACR Acquisition or
any future potential acquisition and other measures that we have taken could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

**_The products that we provide may be exposed to price and margin pressures, and we may be_**
**_unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers at competitive pricing and_**
**_margin levels._**

We may be forced to decrease prices for the products that we distribute due to a number of
factors, such as challenging macroeconomic conditions or increased competition. In our industry,
both light vehicle and truck spare parts manufacturers set retail prices through official
recommended prices for the end-customer. Each participant in the value chain, including us, then
sets its prices as a percentage of the recommended price on the basis of its targeted gross
margin. We may be unable to compensate for a decrease in recommended retail prices by
obtaining supplier rebates, attracting new business, reducing our operating costs (for example,
through headcount reductions, increases in labor productivity or other gains in cost efficiency) or
otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial
condition.

In addition, the impact of laws and regulations, particularly labor and employment laws and
regulations, may restrict our ability to achieve cost reductions and other efficiency gains. See
“—Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and
_employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our_
_business and profitability.” Price and margin pressures may therefore lead to a reduction in_
average prices and margins for our services, which could also have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A decrease in the number of affiliated independent distributors in our network or the_**
**_termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors may adversely_**
**_impact our revenues and profitability._**

We have entered into affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors and
branded garages. These agreements allow them to use one of our brands, including AD Garage,
Garage Expert AD and Auto Primo, and in return the affiliated distributors designate us as their
preferred supplier and the independent garages designate our distributors as their preferred
distributors. Our failure to maintain or renew these agreements, particularly with our affiliated
independent distributors, may reduce the size of our distribution network and our customer
base, which could significantly harm our profitability. Our affiliated independent distributors
have also signed supply contracts with our central purchasing departments and they benefit from
the same discounted prices on purchases as our wholly-owned distributors. Our failure to
maintain or renew these contracts could result in one or more of these affiliated independent
distributors obtaining some or all of their supplies from manufacturers other than our suppliers
or our central purchasing department. Moreover, in most instances, our customers purchase light
vehicle and truck spare parts based on their existing needs, but are not required to purchase a
minimum amount of any of the products that we distribute. Therefore, a significant decrease in
demand for certain key spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks could have a material

34


-----

adverse effect on our results of operations. To the extent that we do not maintain our existing
level of business with our customers, we will need to attract new customers or win new business
with our existing customers and if we are unable to do so, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_The departure of members of our management team or other key personnel, or our inability to_**
**_attract and retain qualified management or other key personnel, could have an adverse effect_**
**_on our business._**

Our success is largely dependent upon the continued service and skills of our existing
management team. If one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or
unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and
our business may be disrupted, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Competition for management and key personnel is intense,
and the pool of qualified candidates is limited, so we may not be able to attract and retain
experienced executive or key personnel in the future, which could hinder our ability to run and
develop our business successfully. In addition, if any of our executives or other key personnel
joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other
key personnel, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and
financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and_**
**_employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our_**
**_business and profitability._**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations
relating to labor, employment, health and safety. The modification, suspension, repeal or
expiration of favorable provisions in labor and employment laws and regulations or, conversely,
any increases of mandatory minimum wages pursuant to laws, regulations or collective
bargaining agreements, or of social security contributions, may negatively impact our business
and profitability. For example, in France we benefit from reductions in employer social security
contributions on certain wages pursuant to law 2003-47 of January 17, 2003, as completed by law
2008-1258 of December 3, 2008 (the “Fillon Law”), as well as from a tax credit for
competitiveness and employment (crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi) (“CICE”).
Pursuant to CICE, French companies receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid to
employees whose wages are less than or equal to 2.5 times the French statutory minimum wage
for 2013 and 6% in 2014. The Fillon Law allows employers to benefit from reductions in such
social security contributions in respect of wages that amount to less than 160% of the French
statutory minimum wage.

Any unfavorable changes in the Fillon Law, CICE or other labor and employment laws and
regulations, or in the terms of collective bargaining agreements applicable to our business, as
well as any increases of the statutory minimum wage in any country or industry in which we
operate, may increase our payroll costs and negatively affect our operating margins and
operational flexibility, and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

In January 2013 an agreement was reached between national employer representatives and
trade unions in France regarding certain labor market reforms. Many provisions of this
agreement now appear in the law on job security published on June 14, 2013. This law provides,
among other things, additional charges on fixed-term employment contracts, greater regulation
of part-time employment and an extension of the scope of complementary health benefits to all
employees. We cannot yet assess the impact of such new measures on our future operations but
they may have an adverse impact on our costs. Labor market reform in general continues to be a
key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda, and changes in any of the
above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations
could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

35


-----

**_A deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a failure to extend,_**
**_renew or renegotiate on favorable terms our collective bargaining agreements could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our business._**

As of October 31, 2013 we had 6,349 employees. Maintaining good relationships with our
employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result,
any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. See “Business—Employees.”

Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These
agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other
things, the general working conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours,
holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining
agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability
to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be able to
extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the
expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or
without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to
additional company-specific agreements or amendments to the existing national collective
bargaining agreements. Such additional company-specific agreements or amendments may
increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

While in the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as
a result of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes, such events could disrupt our
operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

Our labor costs may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce,
salary increases and headcount increases. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs
through increased selling prices or productivity gains. If labor costs increase further, our
operating costs will also increase, which could, if we are unable to recover these cost increases
from our customers through increased selling prices or offset such cost increases through labor
productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Environmental, health and safety regulations relating to our operations could subject us to_**
**_increasing costs or fines._**

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of European directives and
regulations, national, state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment, workers’ health and safety and the use, management, storage and disposal
of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials. These include, in particular,
requirements governing the disposal of used oil, batteries, tires and other materials processed in
our recycling business. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way in which we conduct
our operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other
penalties.

In addition, because we operate property, various environmental laws also may impose liability
on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been
released on our property, including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and
regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at
third-party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances.

With environmental regulations becoming increasingly stringent our future costs of complying
with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future,
could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Such expenses could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty or recall_**
**_claims that may be brought against us._**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the products that
we sell, particularly the truck spare parts we sell, actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected,
or the use of our product results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.
Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and
incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of the products that we
distribute are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of
that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. We may not be able to pass
these liabilities through to the product manufacturer, whether due to unfavorable supplier
warranties or supplier credit issues. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_We could face exposure to product liability claims for products that we import from countries_**
**_outside the European Union and sell under our own trademark._**

As a distributor of spare parts, we may be held liable for defective products if we brand products
with our trademark, such as ISOTECH, and present ourselves as the producer of such products or
we distribute products imported from countries outside of the European Union. Some of the
products that we distribute are branded with our ISOTECH trademark. In addition, we sell
products imported from countries outside the European Union. By selling products under our
trademark or imported from countries outside the European Union, we may be held liable for
any unforeseen defects in products requiring repair under warranty or recall, which,
notwithstanding possible recourse against the relevant manufacturer and supplier, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, the outcomes
of which are difficult to predict. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which
may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. Although individually these
proceedings do not typically involve substantial amounts, in the aggregate such proceedings or
any increase in the number of such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. As of October 31, 2013, our provision for
litigation amounted to €8.3 million.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a
judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, the costs related to litigation proceedings may be significant. Even if there
is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against
our business or products could adversely affect our reputation and we may still have to bear part
or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants,
insurance or otherwise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. See “Business—Legal proceedings.”

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in
tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments.
In addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject
to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax
authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay
taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

37


-----

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, as well as rules and
regulations of the European Union. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and
proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged
infringements of antitrust laws, which could result in fines or other forms of liability, or
otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Such laws and regulations could limit or
prohibit our ability to grow in certain markets.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may not correspond with the interests of the holders_**
**_of the Notes._**

Currently, we are directly or indirectly majority owned by TowerBrook and Investcorp. See
“Principal shareholders.” As a result, TowerBrook and Investcorp are able to control matters
requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of our directors, our
corporate and management policies, potential mergers or acquisitions, the payment of dividends,
asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of TowerBrook and
Investcorp could conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example,
TowerBrook and Investcorp could cause us to pursue acquisitions, divestitures, financings,
dividend distributions or other transactions or cause us to incur additional indebtedness, in each
case so long as the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement so permit. Such transactions could, in their judgment, enhance their equity
investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. The
incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of
certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect
holders of the Notes. Furthermore, TowerBrook and Investcorp may sell all or any part of their
shareholding at any time or look to reduce their holding by means of a sale to a strategic
investor, an equity offering or otherwise.

Additionally, TowerBrook and Investcorp are in the business of making investments in companies
and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with us. TowerBrook and Investcorp may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may
be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by TowerBrook and
Investcorp collectively continue to own a significant amount of our capital stock, even if such
amount is less than 50%, TowerBrook and Investcorp will continue to be able to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions. The interests of TowerBrook and Investcorp may
not coincide with your interests.

#### Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes

**_Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company that has no revenue-_**
**_generating operations of its own and will depend on cash from its operating subsidiaries to be_**
**_able to make payments on the Notes, as applicable._**

Each of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor is a holding company with no business operations
other than the equity interests it will hold in its subsidiaries, and in the case of the Issuer, certain
operations related to the management of our Group. Each of the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor will be dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes and the Parent Guarantor’s obligations under the Parent Guarantee.
The amount of dividends and distributions available to each of the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of
those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law
to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to make
payments in respect of their respective obligations, including under the Notes and the Parent
Guarantee. In addition, the subsidiaries and affiliates of the Issuer (including all of the
subsidiaries of the Issuer, other than Autodistribution S.A. (as of the Additional Guarantor
Accession Date), that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with
respect to the Notes.

38


-----

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

As of the Issue Date, none of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and as of the
Additional Guarantor Accession Date, none of the Issuer’s subsidiaries other than
Autodistribution S.A. will guarantee the Notes. The amount enforceable under the Guarantees
may be limited, and the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees will be subject to the
limitations described in “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the
_security interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee_
could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In particular, the Guarantee of
Autodistribution S.A. is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the
amount of the loan(s) of the proceeds of this Offering made to and used by Autodistribution
S.A., which is expected to be between approximately €66 million and €76 million if the
Completion Date occurs, or €13.6 million otherwise, as described in this Offering Memorandum
under “Use of proceeds.” Other indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor may not be similarly
limited. None of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries will have any obligation to pay amounts
due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of
indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank
financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Parent
Guarantor as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

  - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Parent Guarantor
will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

  - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be
entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As
of October 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
Refinancing, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have had total debt of €11.4 million, all of
which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. Any of the debt
that the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture
will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have and, after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of October 31, 2013,
and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, our pro forma third-party borrowings would
have been €251.4 million, which reflects external loans and borrowings (including finance leases),
of which €240.0 million (including €40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes the
proceeds of which have been placed in escrow potentially to finance the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition) would have been represented by the Notes. The terms of the Indenture will permit
the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in
respect of committed borrowings of up to €20.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. See
“Capitalization.”

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations,
including, but not limited to:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our
other debt and liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal
growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate
purposes;

39


-----

  - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage
or greater financial resources than we have;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business
and industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business
opportunities; and

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds
or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and
refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will
depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our
ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to
service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_The Contemplated ACR Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks._**

We are currently in exclusive negotiations regarding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition.

On the Issue Date, €40.0 million of the gross proceeds from this Offering will be placed in escrow
and held pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of our control.
If any of these conditions is not satisfied, the escrow will not be released. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that the escrow will be released. Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of an
officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the escrow are satisfied, the escrowed funds will
be released to the Issuer and utilized to fund the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. See
“Description of Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition does not occur by May 31, 2014, if the proceeds held in
escrow are not used to fund the Contemplated ACR Acquisition or in the event of certain other
events that trigger escrow termination, €40.0 million of the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption as described in “Description of Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of
_proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to_
receive on the Notes. Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase.
Changes in our business or financial condition, or the terms of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition
or the financing thereof, between the closing of this Offering and the Completion Date, will
have no effect on your rights as a purchaser of the Notes.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our non-guarantor
subsidiaries incur will be structurally senior to the Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes, and such debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence
of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications
and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Borrowings under debt
instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may
as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these
debts in such circumstances. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage
related risks described above. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture will not
prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other arrangements that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization financings. For a
discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
_condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources.”_

40


-----

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_**
**_factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our
debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including
the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to
pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these
alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at
such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may
restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find
alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms
that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain
additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able
to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event, borrowings under
other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions
may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts,
including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding
indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could
harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and
resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of
material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our
indebtedness, including under the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to
use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain
dispositions or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such
dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to
meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

**_We are subject to covenants which limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default_**
**_under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

Our new Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture will contain covenants that impose
significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions,
loans or advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted
subsidiary;

41


-----

  - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

  - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis;

  - change the “center of main interests” of any Dutch Security Providers;

  - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

   - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants.” These covenants could limit our
ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and
other business activities that may be in our interest. Our ability to comply with these covenants
and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing
economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions,
in addition to being in default under the Indenture and the Notes, we could be in default under
the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the relevant lenders could elect to
declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately
due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. This would also result in
an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we
enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and
our other debt.

The Revolving Credit Facility also requires our subsidiaries to maintain a specified financial
maintenance test. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our
operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials
prices and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that this test will be met.
If an event of default occurs under the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders thereunder could
terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and
unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt
instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also
may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be
sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding,
including the Notes. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement.”_

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion_**
**_of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to_**
**_service our indebtedness._**

Under current French thin capitalization rules, the deduction of interest paid on loans granted by
a related party or on loans granted by a third party that are guaranteed by a related party may
be subject to certain limitations. Notably, deductions for interest paid on such loans may be
partially disallowed in the financial year during which they are accrued if such interest exceeds
each of the following: (i) the amount of interest multiplied by the ratio of (a) 1.5 times the
company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of indebtedness owed to related parties (or to
third parties assimilated to related parties) over the relevant financial year; (ii) 25% of the
company’s earnings before tax and extraordinary items (as adjusted for the purpose of these
limitations); and (iii) the amount of interest received by the indebted company from related
parties. Deductions may be disallowed for the portion of interest that exceeds in a relevant
financial year the highest of the above three limitations if such portion of interest exceeds
€150,000, unless the company is able to demonstrate for the relevant fiscal year that the
indebtedness ratio of the group to which it belongs is higher or equal to its own indebtedness
ratio. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups.

In addition, Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) (the “FTC”)
imposes restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses incurred by a French company if
such company has acquired shares of another company qualifying as “titres de participation”
within the meaning of Article 219 I A quinquies of the FTC and if such acquiring company cannot
demonstrate, with respect to the fiscal years running over the twelve-month period from the

42


-----

acquisition of the shares (or with respect to the first fiscal year commencing after January 1, 2012
for shares acquired during a fiscal year that commences prior to such date), that (i) the decisions
relating to such acquired shares are actually taken by the company having acquired them (or, as
the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly
controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 §I of the French
Commercial Code (Code de commerce), that is located in France) and (ii) where control or an
influence is exercised over the acquired company, such control or influence is exercised by the
acquiring company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or
by a company directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of
Article L 233-3 §I of the French Commercial Code, that is located in France).

Moreover, Article 212 bis of the FTC aims to generally limit the deductibility of net financial
charges, which is defined as the portion of financial charges exceeding financial income, accrued
by companies that are subject to French corporate income tax. Pursuant to this Article and
subject to certain exceptions, net financial charges incurred by French companies that are subject
to French corporate income tax and are not members of a French tax group are deductible from
their taxable result only up to 85% of their amount in respect of fiscal years ended as from
December 31, 2012 and only up to 75% of their amount in respect of fiscal years commencing as
from January 1, 2014, to the extent that such companies’ net financial charges are at least equal
to €3.0 million in a given fiscal year. Under Article 223 B bis of the FTC, special rules apply to
companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups. The 85% or 75% limitation applies to
the aggregate net financial charges incurred by companies that are members of the French taxconsolidated group with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group, to
the extent that the companies’ consolidated net financial charges are at least equal €3.0 million
in a given fiscal year.

For fiscal years ended on or after September 25, 2013, the deductibility of interest paid to a
related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC will be subject to a new limitation
pursuant to Article 22 of the French Finance Law for 2014. Interest deduction will be subject to
an additional requirement: if the lender is a related party to the borrower within the meaning of
Article 39.12 of the FTC, the French borrower shall now demonstrate, at the French tax
authorities’ request, that the lender is, for the current fiscal year and with respect to the
concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount which is at least equal to 25% of the
corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules. Where the related party
lender is domiciled or established outside France, the corporate income tax determined under
standard French tax rules shall mean that to which it would have been liable in France on the
interest received if it had been domiciled or established in France. Specific rules apply where the
lender is a pass-through entity for French tax purposes or a UCITS or a similar entity.

These tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in
France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden and reduce the cash flow available to
service our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_**
**_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we
cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would
have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes
or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or the acceleration of,
our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of
control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its respective subsidiaries to

43


-----

allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control,
may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control
occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the
purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under
the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Senior_ _Secured_
_Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not_
necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a
reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us
that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting
power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as
defined in the Indenture).

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control
will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereto, a
certain consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and its subsidiaries is met.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any
person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially
all,” there is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of
control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes.

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the_**
**_Dutch Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_**
**_of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral._**

The Guarantors will guarantee and will provide security in respect of, and the Dutch Security
Providers will provide security in respect of, the payment of the Notes on a senior basis. The
Guarantors and the Dutch Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of France and the
Netherlands, respectively. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the
Guarantors or the enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral will be subject to certain
defenses available to the Guarantors or a Dutch Security Provider in the relevant jurisdiction, as
the case may be. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses may include
those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital,
thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the
Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or the security interest
in the Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other
obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New
York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees against the
Guarantors or security interest in the Collateral against any the Guarantor or any Dutch Security
Provider.

_France_

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness
of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

44


-----

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if
payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return
the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not
receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the
guarantee as a whole. The existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be
determined on a case-by-case basis. French case law has recognized that certain intragroup
transactions (including upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant
company, particularly, where the following four criteria are fulfilled:

  - the existence of a genuine group of companies operating under a common strategy aimed
at a common objective;

  - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

  - the transaction must maintain a balance between the financial commitments of the
relevant affiliates;

  - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or
advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee; and

  - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial
capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts
guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French
case law provides no clear guidance.

The Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the Guarantors.
However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant
Guarantor without rendering its relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under
applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally
available defenses. In addition, should a Guarantee be granted by a Guarantor (other than the
Parent Guarantor) incorporated under the laws of France, such Guarantee would be limited to
the aggregate amount of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French
Guarantor and outstanding from time to time. Any payment that would be made by such
Guarantor under its Guarantee would reduce the maximum amount of its Guarantee. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”

_The Netherlands_

Dutch law may limit the ability of a Dutch Security Provider to grant security on the Collateral.
The validity and enforceability of a security interest granted by or in the Dutch Security Providers
may be successfully contested by the relevant Dutch Security Provider, or its trustee in bankruptcy
if it is subject to bankruptcy proceedings, on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be
successful if both (i) the granting of the security right does not fall within the scope of the
objects clause as set forth in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the
company’s counterparty under the relevant security right knew or ought to have known, without
inquiry, of this fact. In determining whether the granting of a security right is in furtherance of
the objects and purposes of a Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects
clause in the company’s articles of association, (ii) whether the granting of such security right is in
the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk _belang)_ and to its benefit and
(iii) whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security right. The
mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in a Dutch company’s
objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”

**_The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared_**
**_unenforceable against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._**

French and Dutch laws contain similar specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance
both in and outside bankruptcy; the “action paulienne” provisions in France and the “actio
_paulina” provisions in the Netherlands. The action paulienne and actio paulina provisions offer_

45


-----

creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a
person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the person guarantees
the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside
bankruptcy of the relevant person by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant
person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, and may be declared
unenforceable against third parties under both French and Dutch law if: (i) the person performed
such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s
bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act;
and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the
transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future)
would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no
consideration (“à titre gratuit” in France and “om niet” in the Netherlands) in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of
fraudulent conveyance.

In addition, in the case of the bankruptcy of a Dutch Security Provider, the trustee in bankruptcy
may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without
limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the
payee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of performance or
(ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and
the payee in order to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors. If a court
finds that the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the intercompany
proceeds loans, the share pledges or bank accounts pledges, or the granting of a guarantee
involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then
the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the intercompany proceeds
loans, the share pledges or bank accounts pledges or the granting of such guarantee could be
declared unenforceable or nullified. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes
may not benefit from the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the intercompany
proceeds loans, the share pledges or bank account pledges and the value of any consideration
that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the
intercompany proceeds loans, the share pledges or bank account pledges or the Guarantees
could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent
transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for
any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Dutch Security
Providers as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the security interests—France” and “Limitations on validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—The Netherlands.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in_**
**_the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company that is organized and established under the
laws of France, and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are also organized under the
laws of France, and secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Guarantors, the
Issuer and the Dutch Security Providers (which are incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands). In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights of holders of the Notes under the Guarantees or
under security interests in the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of
jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and
other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex
and costly for creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of
France may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’
rights, the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings. The application of these various laws in these jurisdictions could trigger
disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to
realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees or under security interests in the
Collateral.

46


-----

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give
the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the
Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of
the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization.
Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid
foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See “Limitations
_on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Under Dutch and French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by a
Dutch Security Provider, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer, as the case may be, may be adversely
affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch or French law, as the
case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and the Netherlands, as the case may be, may_**
**_not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to_**
**_enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are both
organized and existing under the laws of France. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in France or the Netherlands. Proceedings could also
be initiated in France or the Netherlands to enforce your rights against Collateral located in those
jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for
creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement
of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights
effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition,
while the Dutch Security Providers conduct the majority of their business in the Netherlands, to
the extent that their respective center of main interests is deemed to be in France, they would be
subject to French insolvency proceedings, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or
_conciliation proceedings) and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde), accelerated_
financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde _financiére_ _accélérée),_ or reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency
legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment
of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France.”

In the case of a bankruptcy (faillissement) or suspension of payments (surseance van betaling)
declared in the Netherlands in respect of a person holding title to assets that constitute
Collateral, the Security Agent will be entitled to exercise the rights afforded to a person having a
Dutch law security right (such as a pledge (pandrecht)) over those assets as if there were no
bankruptcy or suspension of payment. However, such a bankruptcy or suspension of payments
could affect the position of the Security Agent as a secured party in some respects, the most
important of which are: (i) the competent court may as a general rule set a period of up to four
months during which the Security Agent may not, without the court’s consent (a) claim the asset
constituting Collateral if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the person holding title to
the asset or, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) or (b) seek recourse
against the asset; and (ii) a trustee in bankruptcy may (a) give the Security Agent a reasonable
period to exercise his other rights and remedies under the relevant security interests and (b) if
the Security Agent fails to sell the asset within that period, claim the asset and sell it, without
prejudice to the Security Agent’s entitlement to the proceeds after deduction of a contribution
to the bankruptcy costs and taking into account the Security Agent’s rank.

Enforcement of a Dutch law security right (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to
Dutch law. Under Dutch law, in principle, a security right is enforced through a public auction of
the asset subject to the security right in accordance with Dutch law. Shares in a Dutch private
limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may be
transferred only upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association
of the company that has issued the shares, as they read at the time of enforcement.

The Security Agent may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the asset
subject to the security right. In the case of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the security
interest provider may agree to an alternative method of sale of the asset once the pledge has

47


-----

become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that
a pledged asset shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. For more information, see
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—The
_Netherlands—Insolvency laws.”_

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Parent Guarantor’s,
the Issuer’s, Autodistribution S.A.’s or the Dutch Security Providers’ jurisdiction of organization
may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the
areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any
conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should
apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Finally, pursuant to the EU Council Regulation No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, the
court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the
court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has its “center of main
interests.” Therefore, to the extent that the “center of main interests” of the Issuer is deemed to
be in France, French courts may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.
Furthermore, under the EU Council Regulation No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings it is not
clear where registered shares in a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap
_met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) are situated so that a court may determine that those shares are_
situated in France or in any other jurisdiction and the enforcement of a pledge of shares in that
Dutch company may be affected by French insolvency laws or the laws of that other jurisdiction.
For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in France and the Netherlands and as
required, the EU Insolvency Regulation, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Autodistribution S.A. and the Dutch Security Providers and their
respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and their business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer, the
Parent Guarantor and Autodistribution S.A. and the large majority of the directors and executive
officers of the Dutch Security Providers are nonresidents of the United States. Although the
Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Autodistribution S.A. and the Dutch Security Providers will submit
to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities
laws, you may be unable to effect service of process in the United States on the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Autodistribution S.A. and the Dutch
Security Providers. In addition, because all of the assets of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and
the Dutch Security Providers and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and
executive officers are located outside the United States, you may be unable to enforce against
them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Autodistribution S.A. and the Dutch
Security Providers may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws
of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters
with France or the Netherlands. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in France or
the Netherlands of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a
U.S. judgment in France or the Netherlands. In addition, the enforcement in France or the
Netherlands of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is
also doubt that a French or Dutch court would have the requisite power or authority to grant
remedies sought in an original action brought in France or the Netherlands on the basis of
U.S. securities laws violations. For further information, see “Enforceability of judgments.”

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations_**
**_and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be_**
**_repaid with recoveries from the enforcement of the Guarantee claims and proceeds from the_**
**_enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of recoveries from
guarantee claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and
enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes or the Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is
required to pay turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility or certain
hedging obligations and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to discharge
the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or the enforcement of the
Guarantees, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under the
Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness are greater than
the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral or the
enforcement of the Guarantees will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and
such hedging obligations and, if applicable future Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the
Revolving Credit Facility have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain restrictions with respect to
the use of proceeds from the sale of assets representing the Collateral prior to the maturity date
of the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement—Maturity and repayment requirements.”_

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure
the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As
such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain
jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the
moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the
security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may
not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the security interests.”_

In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness may restart or
reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period may run from
the moment such new security is amended, granted or perfected. If the security interest granted
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account_**
**_by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale_**
**_of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be
enforced following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount that is due
and remaining unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the
pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors)
or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way
of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors,
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. If the
secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or

49


-----

private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the
foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial
attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a private attribution (pacte
_commissoire). In a proceeding regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire, an_
expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value of the
collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the amount of
the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by
the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such
securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public
auction in accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed
for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in
any such auction might not reflect the value of our business as a going concern.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking
security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the
date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of
the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security
interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction
of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the
Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party,
including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. We
cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also
cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate
a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Parent Guarantee are, and on the Additional Guarantor
Accession Date, the obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee will be, secured on a first-ranking
basis with security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness and hedging obligations (the “Super
Senior Liabilities”). The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in
the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes
to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to
take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of
(i) creditors holding more than 66.67% of the indebtedness and commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain other indebtedness permitted to rank pari passu
with the Credit Facility Agreement on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral (a “Credit
Facility”) and the certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and
(ii) the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in
respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and creditors in respect of certain nonpriority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more

50


-----

than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives).
However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been
fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first being issued or if
Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement
instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the Security Agent has not
commenced any enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority
Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting
on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may at
any time provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay
the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of
enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to
the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first
such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security
Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement
principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an
insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the
instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the
Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such
instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed Enforcement
Instructions from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders and has
commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent shall
continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor representative for the
Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as the credit facility agent issues enforcement
instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such
prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the
Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted
commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the creditors of any other Credit
Facility and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging obligations may have interests
that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a
time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the
Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its holding
companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such
entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of certain
_financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security
Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except
through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes,
you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders
of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the
event of a default. See “Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.”_

**_The Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and Autodistribution S.A. will have control over the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the_**
**_Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor,
Autodistribution S.A. and the other Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the
Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
enforcement event has occurred, the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, Autodistribution S.A. and the
other Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the
Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling,
factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

For a description of the security over the Collateral, see “Summary—The Offering—Security.” In
the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of
the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many
factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the
ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are
located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business
would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, any other Credit Facility or certain hedging
obligations will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the
holders of the pledges securing the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such
distribution with respect to the Notes.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares
or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to
us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will
not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes,
and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of
indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to
secure the Notes and the Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have
been pledged because all the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must
first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the
creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in
the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time.

The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness
or third parties have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted
by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and
remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to
satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the
Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders
of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the
Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Indenture, to certain restrictions on our ability
to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral, including a Consolidated
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined and described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior_
Secured Indebtedness (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) for the
purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio contains certain
important exceptions and carve-outs.

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that only the Security Agent
as security agent, trustee and Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditor has the right to enforce
the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing
the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of
the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

Under both French and Dutch law, certain “accessory” security interests such as rights of pledge
require that the pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be
held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of
interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to
permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security
Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as
principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture
(the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel
Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French or Dutch law will directly secure the
Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other
indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even
if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by
French courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel
Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will
not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the
Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) relating to a bond
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in
France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security
agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof
of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene
French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result
of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal
practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such
circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before
French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the
proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a
case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim.
There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability
under French law.

The Parallel Debt construction has not been tested under Dutch law, and there is no certainty
that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of security interests posed by Dutch
law.

53


-----

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt
construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled
to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the
Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the FTC and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com._
September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust
governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in
safeguard proceedings opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived
from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law
applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the “Trust Convention”), so that the concept of
“trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Netherlands has ratified the
Trust Convention so that any trust to which the Trust Convention applies will be recognized
under Dutch law subject to the Trust Convention. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability
_of the Guarantees and the security interests—France” and “Limitations on validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—The Netherlands.”_

**_Upon a Qualifying IPO, certain Collateral over, or granted by, the Dutch Security Providers will_**
**_no longer apply and will be released and the Notes and the remaining Collateral may be subject_**
**_to hardening and other risks._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake a Qualifying IPO as defined under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain definitions.” In connection with a Qualifying IPO, the_
Collateral over, or granted by, the Dutch Security Providers will be released without the consent
of the holders of the Notes and certain covenants described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain covenants” will no longer apply, including:_

  - “—Center of main interests and establishments”;

  - “—Maintenance of double DutchCo structure”;

  - “—Limitation on Dutch Security Providers”; and

  - “—Limitation on Liens” (with respect to any Dutch Security Providers).

A Qualifying IPO would also result in the release of any share pledges granted by the Dutch
Security Providers and, as such, the holders of the Notes may not be able to enforce any relevant
security interest in the Netherlands in order to control the Group and avoid safeguard or
accelerated safeguard proceedings that might be initiated by the Issuer’s management. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests—France.”

The Parent Guarantor will remain Parent Guarantor under the Notes and be subject to the
obligations under the Indenture. In addition, Liens over any Collateral may be released and
material amendments may be made to any Security Document by the Security Agent on behalf of
the holders of the Notes for the purpose of implementing a Qualifying IPO. Any substitution of
obligors could be treated for French law purposes as an exchange of the Notes for new notes. In
such a case, new security documents in respect of the permanent collateral that will remain in
place following a Qualifying IPO may need to be executed. Furthermore, no assurance can be
given that such a substitution may not be void or voidable if it occurred during a hardening
period. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—Disapplication of
_covenants and release of Liens on a Qualifying IPO.”_

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted_**
**_as security for the Notes._**

If there is an event of default in the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the
extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes. In addition, in
the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over
assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in
certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Revolving

54


-----

Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require,
subject to local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the
Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain
a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain
circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things,
the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being
granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security
principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and
the Dutch Security Providers.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing
those Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders
of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes.
As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the
claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of
certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The
security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Parent
Guarantee if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions it is directed to take
by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, which are necessary to perfect any such security interests.
Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing
the Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against
third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest
in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights
acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security
Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of
property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to
properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no
obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or
the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security
interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the
Parent Guarantee against third parties.

Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the
Notes will not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or
priority of the security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the
security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not
perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in
the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.

**_The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates that_**
**_could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The loans under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest
per annum equal to EURIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. These interest rates could
rise significantly in the future. We may enter into certain interest rate hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required to do so. In addition, there can be
no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. To
the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase to the extent of the drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility,
reducing our cash flow.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your_**
**_consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be
released automatically as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release of
_Liens”, including:_

  - in the case of Collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or
assets constituting Collateral (as applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not
violate the “Limitation on Sales of assets and subsidiary stock” covenant, as described
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” is otherwise permitted in accordance
with the Indenture;

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of the Guarantor;

  - as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Amendments and waivers”;

  - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Satisfaction and discharge”;_

  - in respect of liens over or granted by any Dutch Security Provider, as described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Disapplication of covenants and release of liens
_on a Qualifying IPO”;_

  - the property and assets and shares of a restricted subsidiary designated as an unrestricted
subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

  - with respect to all or part of the structural security, as may be permitted by the
“Maintenance of double Dutchco Structure” covenant;

  - in respect of the security provided by DutchCo and Top DutchCo, upon a change of
control; and

  - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in
an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Parent Guarantee or security interests
in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

   - for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

  - pursuant to an auction or other competitive sale process, under the consultation of an
internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm who shall (save in certain
circumstances) opine on the consideration received by giving a fairness opinion.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail
foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor
measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on
the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. dollars holders (as defined in “Tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) may also have important tax_
consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax considerations—
_Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely
affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and
trading of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Parent Guarantee have not or will not have been, and are not
required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance
with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of
investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers
and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws. For further information, see “Transfer restrictions.”

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined under “Book-entry, delivery and form”) will trade in
book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined under “Book-entry, delivery and form”), will be issued in exchange for book-entry
interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered
owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes
representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear
and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold
book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants
to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream,
the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry
interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant
through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes
under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other
actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be
permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may
not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established trading market.
We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity
of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that
they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing this Offering. However, they have no
obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. In
addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities
Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on
the Global Exchange Market thereof within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and to
maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the
Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of
the Irish Stock Exchange and the admission to trading on the Global Exchange Market or it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or
maintain such listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange, provided that it will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock
exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of
the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in
accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with
the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the
secondary market.

# Use of proceeds

We estimate that gross proceeds from this Offering will be €240.0 million. We intend to use the
proceeds from this Offering to repay in full the existing indebtedness (including in respect of
loans from our shareholders) described below, to pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Refinancing and the Contemplated ACR Acquisition and, to the extent any
proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes, which may include the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition to the extent financed by the proceeds from the Notes and completed. Pending the
completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, €40.0 million of proceeds from this Offering
will be deposited and held in an escrow account. Such proceeds will only be released from the
escrow account to the Issuer on the Completion Date, provided that the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition has been completed on or prior to May 31, 2014, the Offering has been used to
finance the Contemplated ACR Acquisition and the fulfillment of certain other conditions have
been fulfilled. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption.” The following table sets forth our anticipated sources and uses of_
funds in connection with the Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts
depending on several factors, including differences from the estimate of fees and expenses
related to this Offering, the completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition and outstanding
amounts upon repayment.

(1) If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is not completed on or prior to May 31, 2014, if the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is
not financed by the proceeds of the Offering placed into escrow, or if certain other events occur, then we will be required to
redeem €40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to a special mandatory redemption. The special
mandatory redemption price will be 100% of the aggregate issue price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of the special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

(2) Represents €64.3 million in aggregate principal amount and €0.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest that would be outstanding
under the refinancing term facility loan and €18.6 million in aggregate principal amount and €0.05 million in accrued and unpaid
interest that would be outstanding under the corporate purposes term facility, in each case as of January 30, 2014.

(3) Represents the amount required to redeem the EP Bonds.

(4) Represents (i) the €8.8 million in aggregate principal amount and €0.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest outstanding
under the Senior Equity Loan as of January 30, 2014, (ii) the €50.0 million Interest Free Shareholder Loan as of October 31,
2013, (iii) the payment of €2.8 million to repay a shareholder loan owed by DutchCo to Top DutchCo and (iv) a distribution to
DutchCo to satisfy an intercompany balance.

(5) Represents the repayment of all amounts outstanding under our factoring credit line with Eurofactor (an estimated €9.1
million outstanding as of December 31, 2013), our factoring credit line with Natixis (an estimated €0.1 million outstanding as
of December 31, 2013), the Enssemble bilateral facility (an estimated €0.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2013) and
the FPLS bilateral lending facilities (an estimated €1.2 million outstanding as of December 31, 2013).

(6) Represents estimated fees and expenses related to the Transactions, including €13.0 million in underwriting fees and
commissions and fees and costs for legal, accounting, printing, rating advisory and other professional services related to the
Refinancing, and €1.0 million of costs related to the Contemplated ACR Acquisition.

(7) If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed, approximately €12 million to €22 million of this amount would be used to
pay the purchase price and repay outstanding indebtedness and hedging break fees of ACR. If a special mandatory
redemption occurs as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption,” we expect to retain the remaining €44.5 million as cash on our balance sheet for general corporate purposes._
To the extent our estimated fees and expenses for the Offering increase, the principal amount or accrued and unpaid interest
under any of our debt facilities increases or the Notes are issued with original issue discount, our cash for general corporate
purposes will decrease.

(1) We used €7.5 million of our cash to acquire Rougon Queyrel on December 30, 2013, and in connection with the acquisition
we acquired €1.2 million of Rougon Queyrel’s cash. We assumed €0.3 million of outstanding indebtedness of Rougon
Queyrel in connection with its acquisition. The as adjusted for this Offering (including the Contemplated ACR Acquisition)
amount assumes that €17.0 million is used to pay the remaining purchase price and repay outstanding indebtedness of ACR
in addition to the €40.0 million of escrowed proceeds of this Offering.
(2) Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and accrued and unpaid interest.
(3) Represents €64.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under our refinancing term facility loan and
€18.6 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the corporate purposes term facility. We expect that as of
January 30, 2014, €0.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest will be outstanding under our refinancing term facility loan.
(4) The actual and as adjusted for this Offering (excluding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition) amount represents the
aggregate amount outstanding under finance leases as of October 31, 2013. The as adjusted for this Offering (including the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition) amount includes finance leases of ACR in the amount of €0.9 million as of December 31,
2013 that we expect to remain outstanding following the Contemplated ACR Acquisition.
(5) The as adjusted for this Offering (excluding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition) amount represents the aggregate amount

#### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, where we generated 90% of our revenue
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We also hold a strong regional position in the
Polish light vehicle IAM, where we generated 10% of our revenue over the same period. With
over 50 years of experience in the market, we believe that as of December 31, 2012, we held a
market share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle
IAM. The IAM has demonstrated resilience in recent years and currently benefits from
advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with significant purchasing power with
aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network throughout France allows us to
deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each our four business lines, featuring approximately
1.7 million spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these
parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for
light vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and
operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned
distributors to garages represented 75% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 25% of our
revenue in France over the same period. As of October 31, 2013, we had a network of 48 whollyowned distributors and 44 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors
operated out of 489 distribution sites which are supplied either by our three warehouses (one for
each of light vehicle parts, light vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts) or through direct
shipments from suppliers. We use a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operated three warehouses and 43
distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than
125,000 end-customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

Our leading market positions, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we generated revenue of €1,129 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €53.1 million. We are currently in exclusive negotiations regarding the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR is a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light
vehicles. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated adjusted EBITDA of
€6.6 million, and we have in addition identified €6.0 million of cost and purchasing savings per
year that we will seek to realize in large part by having ACR purchase spare parts under our
existing arrangements with our suppliers, which provide for more advantageous terms.

Of the €730.6 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
year ended December 31, 2012, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted for
approximately 51%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately 16%;
truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 10%; and equipment and
tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 23%. The remaining
€246.0 million of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was generated by sales to
affiliated independent distributors.

#### Key factors affecting our results of operations

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and
financial condition and liquidity during the ten months ended October 31, 2012 and 2013 and
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 or which we expect will significantly affect
(or continue to affect) our results of operations in the future.

**_Factors related to our industry_**

_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_

The following factors may affect the amount of light vehicle parts sold in France in any given
period:

  - Size of the car park. The size of the car park impacts the size of the aftermarket for spare
parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair. The size of the car park in the markets in
which we operate is impacted by population size (which has grown to a limited extent in
France over the last five years), consumer spending power, the use of public transportation
(which has increased in recent years) and the rate at which new cars are introduced and
old cars are retired from the car park. Notwithstanding the decrease in new light vehicle
purchases as a result of general economic conditions, the size of the car park in France has
remained stable over the last three years.

  - Average age of the car park. The decrease in new light vehicle purchases combined with
the stable size of the car park has resulted in an increase in the average age of the car park
in France. In general, older cars require more repair and maintenance services and spare
parts than younger cars, and as a result an increase in the average age of the car park can
have a positive impact on our operations. According to L.E.K., the average age of the car
park in France increased from 7.3 years in 2000 to 8.3 years in 2012. The age of the car park
is also impacted by the sales price and production quality of new light vehicles, because
both high sales prices and increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles
to run longer without repair or replacement) generally lead vehicle owners to delay the
purchase of new light vehicles.

  - Postponement of certain light vehicle repairs. Despite a stable car park size and the
increasing age of light vehicles, we believe that during an economic downturn, some of
our end-customers may postpone light vehicle repairs and maintenance due to their
diminished spending power. However, key maintenance inspections and repairs cannot be
postponed for a prolonged period and ultimately these repairs need to be performed in

67


-----

order for a light vehicle to continue to operate at a minimum level. We believe that the
IAM for light vehicles in France has been affected by this temporary postponement of
repairs during recent economic downturns.

  - Miles travelled. Light vehicles that are frequently used and driven many miles typically
require more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than light
vehicles that drive fewer miles. We believe that general economic conditions in Europe and
the increase in the cost of fuel, particularly in France, have affected the spending power of
light vehicle owners and led to a decrease in miles travelled per light vehicle. Government
incentives that encourage carpooling and the use of public transportation also impact
miles travelled. The average number of miles travelled per light vehicle in France
decreased by 1.8% from 2011 to 2012.

  - Preference of independent garages versus manufacturers dealers’ garages. We believe
that the diminished spending power of our consumers and the increasing age of the car
park have encouraged some customers to rely more on garages operating in the
independent segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers segment. However,
certain customers prefer, particularly during the warranty coverage period, to have their
light vehicle serviced in a manufacturers dealers’ garage, due to the link between the
manufacturers’ dealers garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer. On average,
the IAM provides more competitive pricing than the OES. Manufacturer dealers’ garages
tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that have higher prices, given that the sale
of spare parts represents a large portion of the vehicle manufacturer’s gross margin, while
our IAM parts are often sold at lower prices.

  - Increased variety in light vehicles. The number of brands and models of light vehicles in
France has been steadily increasing in recent years, which has resulted in an increase in the
variety of spare parts ultimately ordered by our customers. This increase in the variety of
spare parts benefits large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to
stock a wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop shop for our
end-customers, who increasingly require a wider range of products. We believe that this
increase in brands and models of light vehicles may adversely affect manufacturers dealers’
distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale IAM distributors, which are less
able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. We also believe that the increase in brands and
models of light vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM distributors,
thereby further benefitting established, large and integrated distributors such as us.

The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results, and we believe
have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings and cash flow.

_Technological trends in our industry_

Our results are impacted by the changing technological trends in our industry and our ability to
respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such as
the increased number of driver assistance systems, control devices and other electronic
components, have resulted in sophisticated repair processes and related spare parts. The increased
use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and spare parts has also led to an
extended lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such as exhaust systems, tires, brakes
and motor oil. These trends have adversely affected our operations in certain of our business
segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to wear out less frequently, which in turn
extends maintenance service cycles and leads to lower demand for spare parts and repair services.

Further, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages are required to
acquire the appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to
the tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand, which may result
in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by manufacturer dealers’
garages with the necessary technical expertise. Similarly, given the extended lifespan of spare
parts, certain light vehicle manufacturers have extended their new light vehicle warranties for
eight years or more and provide long-term service programs to customers. However, in many
cases decreasing volumes have been offset by increased prices for technologically advanced spare
parts and complex repair services. In addition, certain technological advancements may require
that entire modules or systems be replaced in certain types of light vehicles, as opposed to

68


-----

discrete parts, thereby increasing replacement costs. We have also developed various marketleading IT services for our customers, including easily accessible websites and support and
training services, in order to keep our customers up-to-date with the latest technological
developments.

_General economic conditions_

Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in
France as a whole have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business
lines responds differently to general economic conditions. Our light vehicles business line tends
to demonstrate resilience during weaker general economic conditions, as light vehicle owners
switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’ dealer garages and the average age
of the car park increases, providing our business with an element of counter-cyclicality, although
we may initially experience slower sales due to destocking by distributors and garages and
vehicle owners delaying repairs. On the other hand, our truck parts distribution business line
shows a higher correlation with general economic cycles, with miles driven by trucks, and
therefore demand for truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve. Our
collision repair business tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles.

In addition, certain of our products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to
exhibit inelastic demand, even during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary
items, such as accessories for light vehicles and truck, tend to be impacted more by the economic
climate.

_Regulation_

The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes,
including those that govern access by IAM distributors and those that seek to impact vehicle
safety and other driver behaviors.

_New BER_

In recent years, the market for the supply and distribution of spare parts has been generally
liberalized as a result of EU regulatory changes. This development has improved access to the
spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors. The light vehicle and truck wholesale sector in the
European Union is currently regulated by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”), which
was adopted in 2010 and replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) A key aim of
the New BER is to ensure fair competition in the light vehicle and truck wholesale sector. In
general, we believe that the current regulatory framework is favorable to our operations and
ensures (i) full access for independent spare parts manufacturers and garages to the technical
information needed to ensure effective competition within and between the IAM and the OES,
(ii) customers’ rights to engage independent garages throughout the life of the light vehicle with
no warranty limitations, (iii) unrestricted sale of spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’ rights to
use private brands and logos for spare parts sales. According to WOLK, the IAM increased its
share of the total aftermarket in France between 2008 and 2011, growing at a CAGR of 1.9%,
while the OES increased by 0.5% over the same period.

_Traffic laws and policy_

The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a decline in collisions as a
result of increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws, though we have
increased our market share in this declining market.

_Social charges_

In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments
for certain social charges, such as the Fillon Law and CICE.

Fillon Law

We are required to pay social security contributions for our employees that cover illness, maternity
leave, incapacity, retirement and death. Pursuant to the Fillon Law, we benefit from reductions in
such social security contributions in respect of wages for those employees whose salaries are less

69


-----

than 1.6 times the French statutory minimum wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnel de
_croissance) (the “SMIC”). The amount of this reduction is limited to 26% of the gross salary of such_
employees (for companies with more than 19 employees), and increases inversely in proportion to
gross salary for such employees (i.e., the reduction is lowest for a gross salary that is just under
160% of the statutory minimum wage, but highest for a gross salary that is equal to the statutory
minimum wage). Our employee costs are therefore impacted by changes in this law. Pursuant to a
January 2011 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary was calculated on a full-year basis (instead
of the monthly statutory minimum wage, as it previously had been calculated). Pursuant to a
January 2012 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary is deemed to include overtime and
bonuses. The effect of these amendments has been to decrease the amount of reductions that we
were entitled to apply to our social security contributions for the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011.

The availability of such reductions in social security contributions is also subject to our compliance
with French regulations relating to mandatory annual salary negotiations with employee
representatives. If we do not comply with such regulations, the reduction in social security
contributions could be up to 10% less than those to which it would normally be entitled. We
could also lose this entitlement altogether (i.e., the amount of the discount in the social security
contributions could be reduced by up to 100%) if we do not comply with the requirement to
undertake salary negotiations with employee representatives for three consecutive years.

CICE

In December 2012, a new tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs (Crédit d’Impôt
_pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi) (“CICE”) was adopted as part of an overall stated French_
government policy to improve the competitive position of companies in France. Pursuant to CICE
rules, French companies will receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid to certain
employees for 2013 and 6% of the gross salaries of such employees for 2014 and subsequent
years. The amount of CICE is calculated on the basis of gross salaries paid to such employees in
the course of the calendar year for employees whose gross salary is less than or equal to 2.5 times
the SMIC. Pursuant to CICE rules, an employee’s gross salary is calculated on the basis of such
employee’s normal working hours plus such employee’s overtime hours (but without taking into
account the overtime rate payable in respect of such overtime).

Under normal circumstances, CICE can be offset against corporation tax due with respect to the
year during which the relevant salaries have been paid. If the amount of the corporation tax
charge is less than the amount of CICE, the balance can be carried forward for the next three
fiscal years and thus be offset against corporation tax charges with respect to such next three
fiscal years. If after these three fiscal years, the amount of CICE has not been fully utilized, the
remaining amount can be refunded by the French tax authorities if requested. Companies under
a safeguard plan are entitled to obtain an immediate refund of the amount of CICE which cannot
be offset against corporation tax. Therefore, these companies are not required to wait until the
end of the three-year period to ask for a refund. However, the French tax authorities’ view
concerning the immediate refund of CICE receivable to companies which are under a safeguard
plan is that only CICE receivables which existed prior to the company entering into the safeguard
plan (i.e., CICE was calculated and declared prior to the company entering into the safeguard
plan) can be refunded immediately, meaning that CICE receivables generated while the company
is under the safeguard plan can only be refunded at the end of the three-year period under the
standard CICE rules.

In our case, as the parent company of our tax group, the Parent Guarantor, entered into the
safeguard plan in 2009, and so CICE receivables have been and will be generated while the
Parent Guarantor is under the safeguard plan. The Parent Guarantor should then not be entitled
to receive an immediate refund of CICE declared in respect of 2013 and subsequent years.

However, we may assign part of our CICE claim to a bank under a factoring agreement in order
to achieve cash flow benefits immediately for approximately 85% of current year CICE and we
may prefinance 85% of CICE with respect to following years. The remaining portion of CICE can
be offset against corporation tax for the next three fiscal years and eventually be reimbursable at
the end of this three-year period as described above.

**_Factors specific to our business_**

_Acquisitions and disposals_

External growth through acquisitions has contributed to the overall growth of our business. We
enhanced our logistics platforms through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading independent French
distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair, in 2005 and Bremstar, a distributor with a
logistics platform dedicated to spare parts for trucks, in 2008. We also acquired Enssemble, a
network of light vehicle spare parts distributors, in 2012 and FPLS, a truck spare parts distributor,
in 2013. In December 2013, we acquired Rougon Queyrel, a distributor of spare parts for light
vehicles in southeastern France. These acquisitions have impacted our results, and limit the
comparability of our results from period to period. We intend to continue to selectively pursue
acquisitions to further expand our network in order to increase our market share. By further
participating in the industry-wide consolidation of the market and integrating acquired entities
into our Group, we believe that we can increase our purchasing power with suppliers, thereby
generating better margins. We also intend to expand our geographic coverage in the French
truck IAM, in part by making selective, local acquisitions. Since our acquisition by TowerBrook in
2009, we have acquired ten companies and disposed of four companies.

Following the conclusion of a fulsome due diligence process, the Parent Guarantor has been
granted a period of exclusivity to negotiate with ACR’s shareholders with respect to a potential
acquisition of ACR and its subsidiary by Autodistribution S.A. The exclusive negotiations are on
the basis of an enterprise value for ACR of between €55 and €65 million. Autodistribution
S.A. and ACR have agreed to initiate the works council consultation processes to proceed with
the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. Under these consultation processes, the applicable works
councils will have a period of time to review and give their opinion on the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, but are not required to approve, and do not have the right to veto, the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. These works council consultation processes are required to be
completed prior to entry into any definitive agreement in respect of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition. We expect these consultation processes to take at least 15 days from
January 14, 2014, date they were initiated.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated revenue of €68.9 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of € 6.6 million. If the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed, ACR will
become a subsidiary of Autodistribution S.A., itself an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor. If we complete the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, ACR’s operating results will
be consolidated with ours in the future. As a result, if we complete the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, our financial results in the future will not be directly comparable to those in this
Offering Memorandum.

If we complete the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, we will account for the acquisition of ACR
using the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, the purchase price for ACR will be,
allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over these
allocations will be assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is
subject to testing for impairment at least annually. The allocation of the purchase price of the
assets acquired in the acquisition will be determined by external experts. This determination of
fair values will result in an increase to our amortization expense. This relates to our acquired
intangible assets because we adjust the book value of the acquired intangible assets to fair value.
Under applicable accounting guidance, we are permitted to continue to make fair value
adjustments until twelve months after the acquisition date. We will evaluate the remaining
depreciable lives of the assets to reflect the estimated useful lives for purposes of calculating
periodic depreciation, and we will continue to amortize the intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives. We will also continue to review the value of the inventory and may make
further adjustments to the fair value, which may change the costs and expenses recognised by us
upon the sale of this acquired inventory.

_Operational improvement measures_
Our results are impacted by operational improvement measures that we implement. Since our
acquisition by TowerBrook in 2009 we have developed and continue to implement operating
strategies designed to increase revenues, reduce costs and capital expenditures and improve
margins. Specifically, we have:

  - Installed a new management team. We introduced a new, experienced management
team who were capable of implementing our strategic vision and driving profitability.

  - Implemented a Profit Improvement Plan. The PIP was initiated following our acquisition
by TowerBrook in 2009, and since the beginning of its implementation through the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, our EBITDA has increased by approximately €30 million in
the twelve months ended October 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31,
2009. The primary focus of the PIP was to reduce the cost of management and
administration at our subsidiaries by implementing shared services, limiting employee costs
in our local businesses, and minimizing transportation and logistics costs by optimizing
truck routes and making greater use of central distribution facilities. We also sought to
improve productivity by eliminating certain loss-making businesses. The PIP also focused on
improving the way our central purchasing departments make purchases, in addition to
refining our enterprise resource system (“ERP”) to allow us to analyze rebates across our
business. As part of such improvements, we segmented purchases among different product
groups, gradually concentrated purchases of core mechanical repair parts among selected
suppliers and used our Group-wide purchasing power to negotiate improved rebates for
purchases of fast-moving spare parts and spare parts with a dominant supplier.
_Integrated payment terms into current working capital operations._ A law enacted in
France in 2008 reduced payment terms as follows: pursuant to Article L. 441-6 of the
French Commercial Code (the “FCC”) “unless otherwise specified by the conditions of sale
or agreed between the parties, the payment period is set for the 30th day following the
date of receipt of the foods or performance of the service requested.” Since the adoption
of this law, Article L. 441-6 of the FCC also provides that “the payment period agreed upon
between the parties may not exceed forty-five (45) days from month-end or 60 days as
from the date of the invoice.” This law has thus implemented a maximum payment period
to all products and services (before its adoption, the parties were able to contractually
determine the payment period without any specific limit, except for transactions relating
to, among others, transport). The implementation of this law had led to a 30-day payment
term reduction which resulted in a one-off, cumulative cash outflow of approximately
€60 million in 2009 and early 2010.
Article L. 441-6 of the FCC is however currently under discussion before the French
Parliament. The draft of a new law called “loi Hamon,” which is expected to be adopted
by the French Parliament by early 2014, provides for the following additional provision to
Article L. 441-6 of the FCC: “In case of a monthly invoice the payment period may not
exceed forty-five (45) days as from the date of the invoice.” Therefore, at this stage, the
amendment of the payment period proposed by the loi Hamon would only apply
to monthly invoices, as defined under French law. If such change or a further change in
regulation were to cause an additional reduction in payment terms, we believe that such
change will be less drastic and that we would be able to quickly and fully adapt our
working capital cycle to such revised payments terms. We also believe we would be able to
pass some further changes in such payment terms on to our customers.

  - Revised margins applied to distributors. Prior to 2009, we charged different margins to
wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors. We have since moved
to a uniform margin for wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.
We have also implemented a loyalty program with both our wholly-owned and our
affiliated independent distributors to encourage them to purchase spare parts and
equipment and tools from our central purchasing departments. As members of our loyalty
program, all our distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by typically
agreeing to purchase at least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.
We believe that one of our most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use
the purchasing power derived from our large size and specialized warehouse and logistics
systems. Through our logistics process, we have been able to obtain more favorable supply terms

72


-----

from suppliers than those available to many other participants in the light vehicle and truck
aftermarket. As part of the PIP, we sought to reduce the number of suppliers we use, and thus
we have concentrated larger volumes of purchases among fewer suppliers, resulting in improved
purchasing terms and conditions for product groups that we distribute. In order to preserve our
flexibility in obtaining favorable prices in the market, we do not generally enter into long-term
supply contracts. We believe this purchasing policy has generally resulted in lower costs.

Beginning in 2014, we will implement a new five-year business plan. As part of this business plan,
we intend to develop our business-to-business sales of spare parts for light vehicles by increasing
the efficiency of our logistics platforms and our supply model, and by improving our customer
service with more efficient call centers. We also intend to further develop over-the-counter sales
of light vehicle spare parts through over-the-counter loyalty programs, specific marketing efforts
and dedicated sales force training. We intend to further develop our truck business by
implementing a new sales strategy, including redefining our product assortment to better suit
local market expectations, launching new sales tools, such as the eBook sales IT system, and
increasing our interaction with our main customers through a product offering tailored to such
customers.

_Competition_

Our results are affected by the level of competition and the types of competitors operating in the
light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket. Our main competitors in the markets in which we
operate are other IAM light vehicle and truck spare part distributors, autocenters, and fast-fitter
chains. The IAM is currently undergoing a period of consolidation, in both France and Poland.
While we participating in this trend of consolidation, we expect that, we will face larger and
better-funded competitors in the future as a result.

We also compete against online light vehicle spare parts retailers which mainly compete with us
on the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the
internet before making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive
price. We realized at an early stage that the internet offered innovative opportunities for light
vehicle and truck spare parts distributors. As a result, we created the Autossimo online light
vehicle repair and maintenance portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online truck repair and
maintenance portal in 2001 in order to address the demand for ordering spare parts online. For
the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, almost €100 million of our revenue by both our
wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors was generated from the sale
of light vehicle spare parts through our online portal, Autossimo.

In addition, we also compete with manufacturers’ dealer garages such as Peugeot and Renault.
Manufacturers’ dealer garages typically specialize in light vehicles from newly-purchased to
three-year-old vehicles, and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by
warranties, as well as a more limited share of light vehicle and truck repairs aged four years and
older. However, certain vehicle manufacturers have extended their new light vehicles warranties
to up to eight years and cover longer-term maintenance and repairs.

#### Explanation of key income statement line items

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line
items of our income statement

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is generated through primarily the sale of products and, to a lesser extent, services to
our customers. We recognize revenue from the sale of products when we deliver the goods to
the customer. We recognize revenue from services in the period in which services are rendered.
We deduct customer rebates and bonuses and other taxes on sales.

**_Cost of goods for sale_**

Cost of goods for sale includes the purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories
and net allocation to inventories depreciation.

73


-----

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages, social security contributions, profit-sharing plans and pension
costs.

**_Other purchases and external expenses_**

Other purchases and external expenses relate to non-direct operating costs, including rental
expenses, shipping expenses, maintenance and repairs costs, legal and other fees, IT expenses,
advertising expenses, subcontracting costs, travelling and other expenses.

**_Taxes_**

Taxes include taxes on salaries (mainly taxes in respect of vocational training), social construction
tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises), social solidarity contribution (contribution sociale de
solidarité — a tax calculated based on a percentage of net sales), and other taxes other than
income taxes.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax, financial
items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from operations and
depreciation/amortization expense.

**_Depreciation/amortization expense_**

Depreciation/amortization expenses represent the depreciation of property, plant, equipment
and intangible assets (excluding goodwill and our brands, such as AD), which are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant, equipment and intangible assets are tested for
impairment when there are indications of impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in
other expenses from operations when the recoverable amount of an intangible asset is lower
than its carry value.

**_Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations generally relate to one-off events or other events
outside of our ordinary business. Other income and expenses from operations can include gains
and losses on the disposal of operations, of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets,
as well as costs relating to provisions and expenses relating to restructuring, employee and tax
disputes, and impairment losses/reversals.

**_Financial income and expenses_**

Financial income includes income from financial investments, foreign exchange gains and other
financial income. Financial expenses include interest on external loans and bank overdrafts
payable by the Group, discounting of borrowings and debt, expenses related to financial
instruments and to finance leases, foreign exchange losses and other financial expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes consist of current tax expense, CVAE and changes in deferred tax assets.

#### Description of other key financial indicators

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain items that we consider to be nonrecurring or exceptional in nature, or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of our
business. See the table set forth in “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other
_information” for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from_
continuing operations for the ten months ended October 31, 2013 and October 31, 2012, and for
the years ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €44.9 million, or 4.9%, from €907.3 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to €952.2 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

In France, revenue increased by €40.5 million, or 5.0%, from €817.1 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012, to €857.6 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €37.2 million, or 6.1%, from
€608.5 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2012, to €645.7 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2013. This increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of Enssemble on

76


-----

July 9, 2012 (which contributed €52.9 million in revenue in the ten months ended October 31,
2013, compared to €20.5 million in the ten months ended October 31, 2012), the acquisition of
FPLS on January 1, 2013 (which contributed €20.3 million to our revenue in the ten months
ended October 31, 2013), the acquisition of the RPDC group on January 31, 2013 (which
contributed €2.6 million to our revenue in the ten months ended October 31, 2013), and the
acquisition of CAMI on June 30, 2013 (which contributed €0.8 million to our revenue in the ten
months ended October 31, 2013). Excluding the effect of these acquisitions, revenue from sales
by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by €18.9 million, or 3.2% on a like-for-like basis
reflecting underperformance at certain distribution sites and weaker market conditions at the
beginning of 2013. We have sought to address underperforming sites through closures,
replacement of management and implementation of profit improvement initiatives.

Revenue from sales to affiliated independent distributors increased by €3.3 million, or 1.6%,
from €208.6 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2012, to €211.9 million for the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a resilient trading performance in a weak
market and several acquisitions made by affiliated independent distributors in the ten months
ended October 31, 2013.

In Poland, revenue increased by €4.5 million, or 5.0%, from €90.2 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012, to €94.7 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, primarily
due to a reorganization and initiatives put in place by the new management team.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €4.8 million, or 10.7%, from €45.0 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012, to €49.8 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Adjusted
EBITDA margin improved from 5.0% for the ten months ended October 31, 2012, to 5.2% for the
ten months ended October 31, 2013.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2.2 million, or 4.8%, from €46.1 million for the ten
months ended October 31, 2012, to €48.3 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was stable at 5.6% between the ten months ended October 31, 2012
and the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due
to lower costs of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue, mainly due to increases in the level
of supplier rebates, following a renegotiation of rates with our suppliers as part of our PIP, as
well as a reduction in other purchases and external expenses relative to revenue, mainly due to
the closing of certain underperforming wholly-owned distribution sites and the renegotiation of
certain of our lease agreements, as part of our PIP. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partly
offset by an increase in personnel costs relative to revenue, mainly due to increases in wages and
social contributions over this period, as well as an increase in our headcount following our
acquisition of Enssemble in July 2012 and FPLS in January 2013. The impact of acquisitions on our
personnel costs was partly offset by overall headcount reductions as part of our PIP, particularly
at certain of our distribution subsidiaries, together with the impact of €4.0 million relating to
CICE.

In Poland, EBITDA increased by €2.6 million, from a loss of €1.1 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to positive EBITDA of €1.5 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved from negative 1.2% for the ten months ended October 31,
2012, to positive 1.6% for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This increase was primarily
due to lower personnel costs, mainly due to headcount reductions in our Polish distribution
operations, and an increase in supplier rebates. Both the headcount reductions and the increase
in supplier rebates resulted from the initiatives taken by the new management team.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €19.4 million, or 3.4%, from €575.2 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012 to €594.6 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Cost of
goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 63.4% for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to 62.4% for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This decrease in cost of
goods for sale as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to increases in supplier rebates,
following a renegotiation of rates with our suppliers as part of our PIP.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €14.7 million, or 8.0%, from €183.2 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012, to €197.9 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. Personnel
costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 20.2% for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to 20.8% for ten months ended October 31, 2013. These increases were
primarily due to increases in wages and social contributions of €12.3 million and €2.0 million,
respectively, over this period, as well as an increase in headcount following our acquisition of
Enssemble in July 2012 and FPLS in January 2013.

Increased wages and social contributions were partly offset by overall headcount reductions as
part of our PIP, particularly at our French distribution subsidiaries and in Poland, together with
the positive impact of €4.0 million relating to CICE.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €2.6 million, or 2.6%, from €101.9 million
for the ten months ended October 31, 2012, to €104.5 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased rental costs of €2.2 million
resulting from the addition of 38 rented sites following our acquisitions of Enssemble in July
2012 and FPLS in January 2013.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11.2% for the
ten months ended October 31, 2012, to 11.0% for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This
decrease was primarily due to the closing of certain underperforming distribution sites and the
renegotiation of certain of our rental agreements in connection with our PIP.

_Taxes_

Taxes increased by €0.9 million, or 12.7%, from €7.1 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to €8.0 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. In the ten months
ended October 31, 2013, taxes mainly comprised of French vocational training tax of €1.9 million
(compared to €1.2 million in the ten months ended October 2012), social construction tax of
€1.7 million (compared to €1.8 million in the ten months ended October 2012), social solidarity
contribution of €1.5 million (compared to €1.4 million in the ten months ended October 2012),
and taxes other than income taxes of €2.8 million (compared to €2.6 million in the ten months
ended October 2012). This increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of vocational
training we provided.

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense increased by €1.2 million, or 9.7%, from €12.4 million for the
ten months ended October 31, 2012, to €13.6 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.
This increase was primarily due to the amortization of assets in Poland in the ten months ended
October 31, 2013, while no amortization had been recognized in the corresponding period in
2012. Those assets were fully impaired in 2012 and the impairment charge was released in 2013
as a result of the strong recovery in Poland following management initiatives.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €3.6 million, or 144.0%, from €2.5 million for the ten
months ended October 31, 2012, to €6.1 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to a reversal of impairment of €2.9 million on our Polish property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets after improved performance, following the full
impairment of these assets as of December 31, 2012.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €2.8 million, or 53.8%, from €5.2 million for the ten
months ended October 31, 2012, to €8.0 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to restructuring costs relating to headcount reductions and the closing
of certain distribution sites in connection with our PIP.

-----

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income increased by €11.3 million, from €1.5 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to €12.8 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This increase was
mainly due to the fair value adjustment of Contingent Value Instruments in the amount of
€12.4 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

Financial expenses decreased by €1.3 million, or 14.6%, from €8.9 million for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012, to €7.6 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. This
decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our cost of debt following amortization payments
of €10.0 million of our Senior Equity Loan and €5.0 million of our Senior Facility Agreement loans
in June 2012 and June 2013, respectively. In addition, we recorded a negative net foreign
exchange variance of €0.3 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, compared to a
positive net foreign exchange variance of €0.8 million for the ten months ended October 31,
2012. Foreign exchange gains and losses in our business are primarily due to fluctuations in the
Polish złoty exchange rate on our local overdraft and working capital borrowings denominated
in Polish złoty.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €1.4 million, from an expense of €6.8 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, to an expense of €5.4 million for the ten months ended October 31, 2013. In
the ten months ended October 31, 2013, income tax comprised CVAE of €4.4 million (compared
to €3.8 million in the ten months ended October 31, 2012), current tax expense of €2.6 million
(compared to €0.4 million in the ten months ended October 31, 2012) and deferred tax income of
€1.6 million (compared to an expense of €2.6 million in the ten months ended October 31, 2012).
This decrease in income tax expense was mainly due to an increase in the higher recognition of
tax losses carried forward for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by €1.1 million, or 0.1%, from €1,085.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €1,084.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. In France, revenue
increased by €0.6 million, or 0.1%, from €975.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, to
€976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned
distributors increased by €18.6 million, or 2.6%, from €712.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €730.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was
primarily the result of our acquisition of Enssemble on July 9, 2012 (which contributed
€31.7 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012) and the acquisition of Truck
Car Services and TC26 on December 30, 2011 (which contributed €2.4 million to our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2012). Excluding the effect of these acquisitions, revenue from sales
by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by €15.5 million, reflecting underperformance at
certain distribution sites, as well as weaker market conditions in 2012 and a €0.7 million increase
in the bonuses granted to our customers.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors decreased by €18.0 million, or
6.8%, from €264.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, to €246.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was due to the acquisition of Enssemble as a whollyowned distributor, because it had previously been an affiliated independent distributor, as well
as a €8.0 million increase in the bonuses granted to our affiliated independent distributors to
incentivize purchase order concentration through our central purchasing department.

In Poland, revenue decreased by €1.7 million, or 1.6%, from €109.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €107.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was
mainly due to challenging market conditions and significant price competition in Poland.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €6.4 million, or 15.3%, from €41.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €48.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2011, to 4.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2012.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €7.8 million, or 18.6%, from €41.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2011, to €49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, to 5.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2012. This increase was mainly due to a decrease in cost of goods for sale as
a percentage of revenue, which was primarily the result of the combination of a decrease in
purchases of goods relative to revenue in France, mainly as a result of higher inventory
consumption levels, and an increase in supplier rebates as a result of higher rates negotiated by
our central purchasing departments in connection with our PIP. This improvement in cost of

80


-----

goods for sale as a percentage of revenue was partly offset by an increase in personnel costs as a
percentage of revenue due to the acquisition of Enssemble, which had a higher ratio of
personnel costs to revenue than the Group.

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €1.4 million, from zero for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to a loss of €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Adjusted
EBITDA margin from our Polish business declined from 0.0% for the year ended December 31,
2011, to negative 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was mainly due to
an increase in the cost of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue, as a result of a decrease in
supplier rebates and the negative impact of a €0.6 million change in inventory for the year ended
December 31, 2012, compared to a positive impact of €10.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011. This decrease was partly offset by a decrease in the volume of goods
purchased for sale by our Polish operations.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale decreased by €12.5 million, or 1.8%, from €702.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2011, to €689.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Cost of
goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 64.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily
due to a decrease of €22.9 million in purchases of goods for sale, which represented 73.6% of
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 71.6% of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2012, mainly as a result of higher inventory consumption levels, and a €3.0 million
increase in supplier rebates, as a result of higher rates negotiated by our central purchasing
departments in connection with our PIP. This increase was partly offset by the negative impact of
a €2.5 million change in inventory for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to a positive
impact of €10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €4.5 million, or 2.1%, from €219.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €223.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Personnel costs as a
percentage of revenue increased from 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared
to 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisition of Enssemble which had a higher ratio of personnel costs to revenue that the Group.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €1.2 million, or 1.0%, from €120.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011, to €121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 11.1% for
the year ended December 31, 2011, and 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2012. During the
period, we experienced a €0.7 million increase in rental expenses related to the acquisition of
Enssemble and a slight increase in rental costs for premises used by our wholly-owned
distributors, a €0.7 million increase in shipping expenses due to an increase in transportation
costs associated with rising fuel prices and a €1.1 million increase in other expenses. These
increased costs were partly offset by renegotiations of lease contracts, the closing of a building at
our Logisteo logistics platform in 2011 in connection with our PIP and a €0.9 million decrease in
advertising costs, due to the combination of lower expenses related to exhibitions and
tradeshows, and increased contributions from suppliers to joint marketing efforts.

_Taxes_

Taxes increased by €1.6 million, or 24.2%, from €6.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2011, to €8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was due to the fact the
year ended December 31, 2011, included a business tax refused as a result of a rectification in tax
calculation, and a nationwide increase in vocational training taxes and other taxes. In 2012, taxes
mainly comprised of French vocational training tax of €1.6 million (compared to €1.2 million in
2011), social construction tax of €1.9 million (compared to €1.8 million in 2011), social solidarity
contribution of €1.7 million (compared to €1.6 million in 2011) and taxes other than income taxes
of €3.0 million (compared to €1.9 million in 2011).

_Depreciation/Amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expenses decreased by €1.9 million, or 11.2%, from €17.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2011, to €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This
decrease was primarily due to a €1.9 million reduction in depreciation of software and licenses
for the year ended December 31, 2012, mainly due to the termination of a leasing agreement
relating to IT software and equipment.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations decreased by €122.1 million, from €125.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2011, to €3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease
was primarily due to the reversal of a €117.9 million reserve in respect of the “Autodistribution”
brand in the year ended December 31, 2011, following a valuation performed by an independent
third party. A previous impairment of the “Autodistribution” brand was recorded in 2008 in the
amount of €150.4 million, based on a negative outcome at that time that resulted in a general
impairment of intangible assets.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations decreased by €11.7 million, or 61.9%, from €18.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011, to €7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This
decrease was primarily due to a €5.9 million decrease in allocations to provisions and expenses
for restructuring, employee and tax disputes, which were mainly due to the closure of a building
at our Logisteo logistics platform in connection with our PIP, and for which we recorded a
provision of €7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. An impairment of fixed assets for
our Polish operations of €3.9 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2011. A
€1.0 million decrease in disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets also
contributed to this decrease in other expenses from operations.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial expenses decreased by €4.3 million, or 28.7%, from €15.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was
primarily due to a reduction in the cost of debt due to a €37.9 million decrease of non-current
borrowings and debt resulting from the early repayment of €15.0 million in June 2011 and
€15.0 million in June 2012 on the Senior Equity Loan and the Existing Senior Facilities. In
addition, we recorded a positive net foreign exchange variance of €0.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, compared to a negative net foreign exchange variance of €1.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011, in each case attributable to fluctuations in the Polish złoty
exchange rate on our borrowings denominated in Polish złoty.

_Income tax_

Income tax increased by €21.9 million, from a €14.1 million income for credit for the year ended
December 31, 2011 to a €7.8 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012.
In 2012, income tax comprised CVAE of €4.7 million (compared to €4.6 million in 2011), current
income tax expense of €0.3 million (compared to €0.7 million in 2011) and a deferred tax expense
of €2.8 million (compared to a deferred tax credit of €19.4 million in 2011). This €22.2 million
variation in deferred taxes was mainly due to an increase in the recognition of tax loss carry
forwards for the year ended December 31, 2011.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by €5.3 million, or 0.5%, from €1,090.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €1,085.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

In France, revenue increased by €10.5 million, or 1.1%, from €965.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €975.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

83


-----

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors remained relatively stable, decreasing by
€1.7 million, or 0.2%, from €713.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to
€712.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Revenue from sales to affiliated independent distributors increased by €12.3 million, or 4.9%,
from €251.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to €264.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011. This increase was due to our strong organic volume growth in sales to
affiliated independent distributors, primarily due to the sale of a wholly-owned distributor in
June 2010, which subsequently became an affiliated independent distributor.

In our international operations, including Poland, revenue decreased by €15.8 million, or 12.6%,
from €125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to €109.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of our Italian
operations within discontinued operations in 2011 following the sale of our majority stake,
which had a negative impact of €16.1 million on our international revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2011. Excluding this reclassification, international revenue remained stable,
increasing by 0.3 million or 0.2%, from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended
December 31, 2011.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €12.7 million, or 43.5%, from €29.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010, to 3.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €13.1 million, or 45.5%, from €28.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2010, to €41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010, to 4.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2011. These increases were mainly due to a decrease in cost of goods for
sale relative to revenue, which resulted from the combination of an increased focus on
purchasing efficiency and a decline in the positive impact of the change in our inventory for the
year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in
Adjusted EBITDA margin in France was also due to a decrease in personnel costs and other
purchases and external expenses relative to revenue, which resulted from a decrease in
headcount in our central purchasing department, headquarters and distribution subsidiaries in
connection with our PIP, as well as a decrease in marketing and IT expenses in our subsidiaries.

Internationally, Adjusted EBITDA remained stable, decreasing by €0.4 million, from €0.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010, to zero for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our
international Adjusted EBITDA margin declined from 0.3% for the year ended December 31,
2010, to 0.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the
positive €1.3 million contribution of our Polish operations to international Adjusted EBITDA was
partly offset by the negative €1.0 million contribution of our Italian operations. For the year
ended December 31, 2011, international Adjusted EBITDA consisted only of the zero Adjusted
EBITDA of our Polish operations, due to the reclassification of our Italian operations within
discontinued operations.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale decreased by €10.1 million, or 1.4%, from €712.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2010, to €702.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Cost of
goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 65.3% for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to 64.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was partly
due to the reclassification of the Italian operations as discontinued operations, which accounted
for €14.1 million of cost of goods for sale for the year ended December 31, 2011. Excluding this
reclassification, cost of goods for sale as a percentage of our revenue decreased from 65.3% for
the year ended December 31, 2010, to 65.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011. This
decrease was due to a €2.3 million decrease in net inventories depreciation (without giving effect
to the reclassification of our Italian operations) resulting from improvements in inventory
management, and the positive impact of an €11.7 million change in inventory for the year ended

84


-----

December 31, 2011 (without giving effect to the reclassification of our Italian operations),
compared to a positive impact of a €6.2 million change in inventory for the year ended
December 31, 2010.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs decreased by €4.5 million, or 2.0%, from €223.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €219.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Personnel costs as a
percentage of revenue decreased from 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, to 20.2%
for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to a €4.8 million decrease
in wages, driven by a decrease in headcount in our central purchasing department, headquarters
and distribution subsidiaries, in connection with our PIP. Our total workforce decreased by 133
employees, from 6,339 employees as of December 31, 2010, to 6,206 employees as of
December 31, 2011.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses decreased by €2.2 million, or 1.8%, from €122.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010, to €120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2010, to 11.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease
was primarily due to a €1.0 million decrease in IT expenses driven by the renegotiation of an IT
maintenance contract, a €0.8 million decrease in advertising costs due to increased contributions
by suppliers to joint marketing efforts, and a €0.7 million decrease in other expenses. This
decrease was partly offset by a €1.8 million increase in shipping expenses due to increased fuel
prices.

_Taxes_

Taxes decreased by €1.8 million, or 21.4%, from €8.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2010, to €6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2011, taxes mainly comprised
French vocational training tax of €1.2 million (compared to €1.4 million in 2010), social
construction tax of €1.8 million (compared to €2.1 million in 2010), social solidarity contribution
of €1.6 million (compared to €1.5 million in 2010) and taxes other than income taxes of €1.9
million (compared to €3.4 million in 2010). This decrease was primarily due to tax deductions
granted in the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of a rectification in tax calculation.

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense decreased by €1.6 million, or 8.6%, from €18.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010, to €17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This
decrease was primarily due to a €1.3 million reduction in the depreciation of our property for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €102.4 million, from €23.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was
primarily due to the reversal of €117.9 million reserve in respect of the “Autodistribution” brand
for the year ended December 31, 2011, following a valuation performed by an independent
third-party. The impairment of the “Autodistribution” brand was previously recorded in 2008 for
an amount of €150.4 million, based on a downward trend in the business at that time.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations decreased by €10.1 million, or 34.8%, from €29.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010, to €18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This
decrease was primarily due to the annual impairment test performed on our Polish operations,
which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of €0.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2011, compared to €12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial expenses increased by €2.8 million, or 23.0%, from €12.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to €15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was

85


-----

primarily due to a €1.1 million increase in financial expenses on finance leases and a negative net
foreign exchange variance of €1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a
positive net foreign exchange variance of €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in
each case are attributable to fluctuations in the Polish złoty exchange rate on our borrowings
denominated in Polish złoty.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €16.1 million, from a €2.0 million expense for the year ended
December 31, 2010, to a €14.1 million credit for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2011,
income tax included CVAE of €4.6 million (compared to €3.5 million in 2010), current income tax
expense of €0.7 million (compared to €0.1 million in 2010) and deferred tax income of
€19.4 million (compared to a deferred tax income of €1.6 million in 2010). This €17.8 million
increase in deferred tax income was mainly due to higher recognition of tax loss carryforwards
for the year ended December 31, 2011.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital
expenditures, operating losses, acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our
principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated
from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities and finance leases.

We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents,
cash generated from operations, any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft
facilities, including our new €20.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, that will be available for
drawing following completion of this Offering, factoring facilities and finance leases.

Our financial condition and liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, influenced by a
variety of factors, including:

  - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

  - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on
such indebtedness, which affects our finance costs;

  - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements;

  - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks;

   - our level of acquisition activity; and

  - our capital expenditure requirements.

Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following:

  - paying operating costs and working capital;

  - funding capital expenditures;

  - servicing indebtedness; and

  - paying taxes.

_Cash flows from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities is mainly impacted by changes in working capital and other
items with a cash effect, in addition to changes in net income and cancellations of unrealized
income and expenses, the elimination of financial expenses and income with a cash effect, and
the elimination of income tax.

The monthly variations of the net cash flows from operating activities are largely impacted by
the seasonality of our business. In particular, our working capital is typically high (resulting from
higher inventories and receivables) as of October 31 each year, which explains the much lower
level of net cash flow from operating activities at October 31 compared to December 31. In
addition, some one-off items impacted the net cash flow from operating activities for the ten
months ended October 31, 2013 compared to the ten months ended October 31, 2012.

87


-----

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €2.5 million (or 0.3% of revenue) for the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses, partly offset by an unfavorable change in
working capital due to an increase in inventory because of seasonality effects and the
implementation of the recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our logistics
platform for light vehicles, and a higher net receivables and payables position.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €16.9 million (or 1.9% of revenue) for the ten
months ended October 31, 2012, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €12.4 million) offset by
an increase in working capital, mainly other receivables and payables due to seasonality effects.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €39.0 million (or 3.6% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a positive impact of net income after adjustments for
non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €15.1 million) and a decrease in working
capital, due to lower receivables because of the decrease in activity at the end of 2012.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €30.4 million (or 2.8% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to a positive impact of net income after adjustments for
non-cash income and expenses (mainly the reversal of a €117.9 million impairment in respect of
the “Autodistribution” brand offset by a depreciation of €17.1 million, provision for closing the
building of one of our logistics platforms for €6.0 million and impairment of €3.9 million on our
Polish goodwill and tangible assets).

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €15.6 million (or 1.4% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a positive impact of net income after adjustments for
non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €18.6 million) which is partly offset by the
slightly unfavorable change in working capital.

_Working capital_

Working capital comprises trade working capital and other receivables and payables. Our trade
working capital is comprised of inventories, trade payables and trade receivables. Other
receivables and payables are primarily comprised of tax and employee benefit payables.

Our inventory levels are affected by the seasonality of our activity, our product range strategy
and our ability to manage our stocks locally. The change in trade payables and receivables is
mainly linked to the seasonality of our business. The level of receivables may also be impacted by
our ability to recover payments from our customers.

Our working capital requirements are affected by the seasonality of our business. Our typical
working capital cycle is primarily driven by the build-up of inventory during the first semester,
with our working capital reaching its peak in July and October, and a decrease of our inventory
in the second semester, with our working capital reaching its trough in November.

We generated an increase in working capital of €34.1 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in trade receivables of €31.4 million, and an
increase in other receivables and payables of €14.4 million for the ten months ended October 31,
2013, partly offset by an increase in trade payables of €21.5 million. These variations were mainly
due to the seasonal peak of our working capital cycle which occurs in October, an increase in
revenue and to a lesser extent to certain one-off items such as extended payment terms agreed
with several customers and an overdue payment from one customer. Moreover, the increase in
inventories of €9.8 million is primarily due to voluntarily high inventory levels, to anticipate
possible delivery delays due to the implementation of our new warehouse IT management
system at the end of 2013 and the seasonal peak in October.

We generated an increase in working capital of €17.9 million for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, primarily due to an increase in trade receivables of €6.3 million, an increase in
inventories of €6.1 million, and the negative impact of the increase in other receivables and
payables, which were partly offset by an increase of trade payables of €8.0 million. These
variations were mainly due to a seasonal impact in October, partly offset by the weaker activity
at the end of the ten months ended October 31, 2012, due to the market downturn.

We experienced a decrease in working capital of €6.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2012, which primarily reflected a decrease in trade receivables of €21.1 million, partly offset by a

88


-----

decrease in trade payables of €15.2 million, due to a decrease in trading activity. Moreover, the
decrease in inventories of €2.4 million is primarily due to improvements in inventory
management and the weaker market conditions in 2012.

We experienced a decrease in working capital of €1.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2011, which primarily reflected a positive impact of €5.0 million of other receivables and
payables, mostly related to an increase in tax liabilities (mainly VAT and social security liabilities)
and higher personnel expenses due to an increase in bonuses paid to our employees in 2011.

We generated an increase in working capital of €2.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2010, which primarily reflected an increase in trade receivables of €2.2 million and an increase in
trade payables of €2.5 million, in line with revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2010.

_Other items_

Other items with a cash effect related solely to income tax paid of €4.7 million for the ten
months ended October 31 2013, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €4.4 million. Other items with a
cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of €4.3 million for the ten months ended
October 31 2012, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €3.8 million. Other items with a cash effect
related solely to the income tax paid of €6.4 million for the year ended December 31 2012,
mostly as a result of the CVAE of €4.7 million and an over-estimate of income tax prepayments.
Other items with a cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of €4.1 million for the year
ended December 31 2011, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €4.6 million. Other items with a cash
effect related solely to the income tax paid of €4.0 million for the year ended December 31 2010,
mostly as a result of the CVAE of €3.5 million.

the periods indicated.

_Capital expenditures_

Capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition of fixed assets. Our capital expenditures
include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations.
In particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving
and machinery for the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases
of light vehicles and trucks. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the
capitalization of new functional development costs of our enterprise resource platform (“ERP”),
the purchase of software licenses relating to management and financial reporting, technical light
vehicle and truck databases and inventory management.

We have a “capex light” business model, and consequently are not required to make significant
capital investments in our business. Our capital expenditures were on average, 1.4% of our
revenue and 39.7% of our Adjusted EBITDA in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and
2012.

We expect our investment in capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2014 to be in line with that of prior years, and we do not anticipate making any extraordinary
capital expenditure investments in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014.

89


-----

Capital expenditures increased by €1.9 million, to €13.4 million (or 1.4% of revenue) for the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, from €11.5 million (or 1.3% of revenue) for the ten months
ended October 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the renovation of several
distributions sites and the new AD logo deployment.

Capital expenditures were €11.5 million (or 1.3% of revenue) for the ten months ended
October 31, 2012, and was primarily due to IT investment, particularly expenditures associated
with our development costs of the ERP, our data center and with the Autossimo website.

Capital expenditures remained stable at €15.9 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased investments in IT, particularly expenditures
associated with development costs of the ERP, our data center and the Autossimo website, which
were partly offset by lower expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations.

Capital expenditures increased by €1.8 million, to €15.9 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2011, from €14.1 million (or 1.3% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2010. This increase was mainly due to increased investments in IT, particularly IT
infrastructure, and higher expenditures related to the expansion of our operations, primarily
relating to the opening of two new distribution sites.

_Business acquisitions and advances paid_

Business acquisitions and advances paid mainly relate to external acquisitions, and advances paid
in relation to those acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net of cash (or
overdraft) held by such acquired entity.

Business acquisitions and advances paid decreased by €6.7 million, to €6.8 million (or 0.7% of
revenue) for the ten months ended October 31, 2013, from €13.5 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for
the ten months ended October 31, 2012. These business acquisitions mainly include the negative
cash position of FPLS paid in December 2012 but consolidated as from January 1, 2013, the
acquisition of the Rectification Du Pas-De-Calais group and the acquisition of Comptoir Auto
Marine Industrie.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €13.5 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for the
ten months ended October 31, 2012. These business acquisitions mainly include the acquisition of
the outstanding 80% of the share capital of Enssemble and the acquisitions of Station Technique
Auto and Station Technique Auto Carrosserie.

Business acquisitions and advances paid increased by €14.9 million, to €17.6 million (or 1.6% of
revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2012, from €2.7 million (or 0.2% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2011. These business acquisitions and advances paid primarily include
the acquisition of the outstanding 80% of the share capital of Enssemble and the acquisition of
Station technique Auto and Station Technique Auto Carrosserie. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, advances paid amounted to €3.8 million, primarily due to the advance paid
for the acquisition of FPLS (which was consolidated beginning on January 1, 2013).

Business acquisitions and advances paid increased by €0.5 million, to €2.7 million (or 0.2% of
revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2011, from €2.2 million (or 0.2% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2010. These business acquisitions mainly included the acquisitions of
Société d’Investissement Automobile APS Saillard and Comptoir Vitryat and the acquisitions of
Truck Car Services and TC26.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €2.2 million (or 0.2% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2010. These business acquisitions mainly included the acquisition of
Arnaudiès and the acquisition of Neoparts.

#### Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about financial risk

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. We monitor
and manage these risks as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which
recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potential adverse
effects on our results of operations.

**_Counterparty risk_**

Counterparty risk represents the risk of incurring a financial loss as a result of a breach of a
payment obligation by third parties. We have adopted credit management procedures adjusted
to the characteristics of the market and of our customers in order to reduce the risk of exposure
and to attempt to allow prompt and proactive management of our business. The proactive
customer credit risk monitoring activities start by grouping consumers based on their type, the
credit duration, the existence of previous financial difficulties or notifications and of the possible
existence of legal or ongoing bankruptcy procedures. Financial assets are recorded in the
financial statements net of the write-off based on the risk of breach by the counterparty, which
is determined based on the available information regarding the customer’s solvency.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk, or funding risk, represents the risk that we may encounter difficulty procuring the
funds necessary to honor our commitments from operations in an economic manner and in due
time. The cash flows, funding needs and liquidity of the Group are monitored and managed
centrally under the control of the finance department, which has the objective of guaranteeing
the effective and efficient management of financial resources. We believe that the funds and the
credit facilities currently available, including our new €20 million committed Revolving Credit
Facility will, in addition to the liquidity that will be generated by operations and financing
activities in the ordinary course of business, allow us to meet our needs with respect to
investment activities, managing working capital and repaying debt on its scheduled maturity
dates.

93


-----

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The euro is the functional currency in which our financial statements are presented. Our
subsidiary in Poland generates currency in Polish złoty, and for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013 Polish złoty represented 9.9% of our revenue. We do not hedge this exchange
rate risk.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risks due to our need to finance our operations as well as to
utilize our available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a negative or a
positive impact on our financial results by indirectly influencing the repayment of loans and
investments. Following the Transactions, our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be
primarily comprised of the Notes (which will have a fixed interest rate) and the Revolving Credit
Facility (which borrowings will have an interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR).

We evaluate our exposure to changes in interest rates on a regular basis and may decide to
manage the foregoing risks through financial derivatives, according to the directives contained in
the “Interest rate risk management policy” we have adopted. Notwithstanding our potential use
of hedging instruments, unexpected changes in interest rates could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

#### Off-balance sheet arrangements

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. For a description of certain
commitments and guarantees that we have given to third parties in connection with our
financing arrangements and other ordinary course rental and other obligations, see note 20 to
our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012.

#### Other financial obligations: Pension obligations

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see note 22 to our audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 and note 21 to our
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the ten months ended October 31, 2013.

#### Critical accounting policies

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various
estimates and assumptions that affect the results we report. Such estimates or assumptions are
based on our historical experience and currently available information, including expectations of
future events that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
significantly from such estimates in light of the uncertainty surrounding the assumptions and
conditions upon which the estimates are based. The following are significant accounting policies
determined on the basis of such estimates and assumptions for which changes during a financial
period could involve a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether there is any indication that a nonfinancial asset might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA plan
for each Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) as defined by us. For purposes of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs most likely to benefit from the synergies of
the business combination and to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by us. The CGUs
correspond to subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries that are included in the same operating
segment and that generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by other CGUs.
The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result
following the changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment, we carry out impairment tests. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed
separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that
show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

94


-----

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that we will
have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The calculation
of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits, with
regard to tax management strategies.

**_Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions regarding discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates.

**_Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

# Industry

_This discussion contains market and competitive position data from industry publications and_
_from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources._

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, where we generated 90% of our revenue
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We also hold a strong regional position in the
Polish light vehicle IAM, where we generated 10% of our revenue over the same period. With
over 50 years of experience in the market, we believe that as of December 31, 2012, we held a
market share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle
IAM. The IAM is the independent aftermarket for spare parts used in the maintenance and repair
of light vehicles and trucks. These spare parts include mechanical parts, electrical parts and
electronic components, body parts (including headlights), assembly parts, tires, oils and
lubricants, car paint, other chemical products and accessories. The light vehicle aftermarket is
relatively complex compared to other industries, due to the large number of market participants
with varying business models.

In general, the light vehicle aftermarket can be divided into the following two segments:

  - Original equipment suppliers aftermarket segment (“OES”), which is operated through a
distribution network directly connected to car manufacturers and generally consists of
authorized garages managed by car dealers; and

  - The IAM, which is operated by independent distributors and garages, which are not
connected to car manufacturers and typically service all of the vehicles operating on the
road without making a distinction between brands.

Original equipment suppliers and IAM suppliers sell their products to wholesalers and distributors
which often operate on a national level. Regional and local wholesalers frequently buy these
products from national wholesalers and distributors for further sale to garages, body shops, fastfitters and car centers.

The following chart provides an overview of the interaction of the key participants in the IAM in
France, from the manufacturer level to the garage and repair point level, and we have illustrated
our own position within the purchasing and distribution segments below as an example.

The following are the key participants in the IAM in France:

  - Purchasing group: A department making purchases on behalf of a larger group of
distributors. Consolidated purchases made through a purchasing group increase
bargaining power with suppliers and enable greater discounts on purchased parts.

-----

  - Distributors. In the French OES, distribution is generally carried out by authorized resellers
of the manufacturers that supply authorized dealers. In the IAM, distribution is carried out
by independent distributors that supply products, depending on the specifics of the
geographic area in which they operate, to wholesalers (which, in turn, supply garages,
body shops, fast-fitters and car centers) or directly to garages, body shops, fast-fitters and
car centers, depending on the specifics of the geographic area in which they operate.

  - Garages (including body shops). Garages are either authorized by a car manufacturer or
manufacturers, or operate independently and do not maintain any relationship with a
particular manufacturer. Authorized garages generally specialize in the OES and, in
general, solely offer products and services relating to the vehicles produced by the
manufacturer to which they are connected. Consequently, authorized garages only provide
services in relation to a limited range of vehicles. By contrast, independent garages that
operate in the IAM generally offer services and repairs on all vehicles, without
distinguishing between vehicle manufacturers and models.

There are often exceptions to the supply chain described above, largely due to the expectations
of end-customers that garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers obtain light vehicle spare
parts in a timely manner. For example, larger garage networks or specialist repair center chains
often source particular light vehicle spare parts from an external wholesaler. In some cases,
authorized dealerships may source spare parts externally.

#### Differentiating factors between the IAM and the OES

Key factors considered by end-customers when deciding to use the services provided by the IAM,
rather than the OES, include:

  - the wide range of products offered by IAM operators and the segment’s competitive
pricing; and

  - the timely execution of maintenance and repair services, which generally favors IAM
operators due to the efficiency of the IAM distribution network and the capacity of
independent garages to quickly obtain spare parts that they may not have in stock.

#### Development of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France

We participate in the aftermarket value chain as a business-to-business distributor of spare parts
for light vehicles and trucks, generating approximately 90% of our revenue in France. As of
December 31, 2012, WOLK valued the French light vehicle aftermarket at €12,401 million, of
which the IAM contributes approximately 56%, or €6,945 million, and the OES contributes 44%,
or €5,457 million.

The table below shows the historical development (as estimated by WOLK) of the French light
vehicle aftermarket from 2003 to 2011:

**2003** **2004** **2005** **2006** **2007** **2008** **2009** **2010** **2011**

_OES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ — 1.5% 0.8% 0.1% 6.1% 1.5% (2.5%) 0.9% 3.2%

The aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France is characterized by stable growth and
has historically been resistant to downturns, including the recent economic downturn.

Between 2003 and 2011, the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles increased at a CAGR of
1.1%. During the same period, the IAM increased by 0.9% while the OES increased by 1.4%.
WOLK expects that the French IAM will remain stable between 2011 and 2015.

#### Key factors influencing growth of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in France

The IAM may, in the near future, remain stable or experience low levels of growth due to a
combination of factors, including increased demand as a result of the age, mileage and
composition of vehicles on the road, technological developments, and the range of services
rendered and products offered by the IAM compared to the OES.

**_Number of vehicles on the road_**

The total number of vehicles on the road is a key factor affecting the development of the spare
parts aftermarket. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 30.6 million light vehicles
on the road in France. Growth in the number of vehicles on the road is measured by the number
of new registrations over a certain period, minus the number of vehicles retired during that
period. The number of new registrations is influenced by a variety of factors, including the
purchasing power of the overall population, the density level of light vehicles on the road and
the availability of government incentives to purchase new vehicles. The number of light vehicles
on the road has remained stable in recent years and, according to L.E.K., is expected to continue
to remain stable in the near future.

**_Age of light vehicles on the road_**

L.E.K divides light vehicles on the road into four categories of age: (i) zero to four years; (ii) five
to nine years; (iii) ten to fourteen years; and (iv) more than fifteen years. As of December 31,
2012, the average age of light vehicles on the road in France was 8.3 years. In addition, the
number of light vehicles on the road aged five years or more has been increasing at a CAGR of
0.4% since 2004, equating to 65.3% of the vehicles on the road in 2012.

We believe that consumer preferences for services and repairs vary depending on the age of the
vehicle in question. Despite the fact that the quality of service and the validity or duration of a
vehicle warranty is generally not compromised when using services and parts sourced from
independent garages, consumers who own vehicles that are four years old or less typically use
authorized garages operating in the OES to perform related maintenance and repair services
because their vehicles are typically covered by manufacturer warranties. We believe that
consumers who own vehicles that are more than four years old increasingly prefer to have their
cars serviced by independent garages. This is primarily due to the expiration of car warranties
and the fact that these particular consumers are more concerned by the pricing of services and
parts, which is typically a favorable development for the IAM. As a result, spare parts supplied for
vehicles over five years old constitute the majority of the IAM.

**_Composition of vehicles on the road_**

The composition of vehicle makes and models on the road is largely determined by the
purchasing power and preferences of end-customers. Such composition influences the frequency
of maintenance and repair services, the average price of spare parts used for repairs and the
overall development of the IAM.

Vehicles on the road in France are generally of high quality. As a result, the average price of
spare parts is higher. We expect the IAM to capture a higher share of the market as the average
age of vehicles in France increases.

Furthermore, there is an increasing heterogeneity in vehicle brands, resulting in a need to be
able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. This increasing complexity tends to benefit the IAM
over the OES, due to its efficient management of the proliferation of different brands, ability to
address a larger and more diverse customer base, and its greater economies of scale.

**_Miles travelled_**

The need for maintenance and repair services is directly related to the age of and number of
miles travelled by vehicles. For example, an increase in fuel prices or, for example, the adoption
of government incentives to use public transportation, or disincentives to travel by car, may have
an impact on the number of miles travelled over a certain period. Over the past five years, the
number of miles travelled in Europe has been negatively impacted by a weak economic climate,
among other factors.

98


-----

**_Technological developments and prices_**

Technological developments in the light vehicle industry generally lead to an increase in the
quality of vehicles available, as well as the components used in car manufacturing becoming
more complex. While an increase in quality generally results in an increase in the durability of
vehicle components, it also tends to lead to an increase in the average price of spare parts.
Furthermore, there is a general trend towards the use of modules in automobiles, which are
more expensive to replace than single parts.

The increasing complexity of vehicle components can also impact the growth potential of the
IAM, because service providers need to develop their vehicle expertise and technical capabilities
to continue to provide minimum maintenance and repair services.

**_Regulation_**

The European regulatory environment directly affects the European light vehicle aftermarket,
and has been generally favorable towards IAM operators in recent years. The general trend has
been towards granting the IAM full access to the market by limiting restrictions on independent
manufacturers selling automobile parts to authorized or independent distributors and garages,
and end-customers. In addition, the current regulatory framework requires that the OES grant
IAM operators full access to relevant technical information and permits only certain limitations
on vehicle warranties.

**_New distribution channels_**

With the development of web-based databases, both garages and end-customers are able to
identify, source and order required spare parts via the internet. This relatively new distribution
channel will be key in retaining and capturing market share going forward, because customers
will formulate their purchasing decisions while engaging with these internet databases.

#### Changes in vehicle use in France

L.E.K. estimates that, as of December 31, 2012 there were approximately 30.6 million vehicles on
the road in France, corresponding to a density of 468 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants. L.E.K.
estimates that 65.3% of vehicles on the road are more than four years old. One of the primary
reasons for this high number of relatively new vehicles derives from government incentives
introduced in France, designed to encourage the purchase of new cars. We believe that the
decline in purchasing power of the population and the absence of government incentives for
new car purchases will lead to an increase of the average age of vehicles on the road in France,
resulting in growing demand for IAM products and services.

The following table sets forth the historical development of French vehicles on the road from
2004 to 2012 in terms of size and age:

**2004** **2005** **2006** **2007** **2008** **2009** **2010** **2011** **2012**

L.E.K. estimates that the number of vehicles on the road in France will be fairly stable at a CAGR
of 0.0% from 2012 until 2014. In addition, L.E.K. estimates that the portion of vehicles on the
road with an average age of more than four years, which accounted for 65.3% of vehicles in
France as of December 31, 2012, will increase to 67.0% by 2014 and to 69.0% by 2018.

#### Competitive landscape of the IAM in France

Distribution in the French IAM is highly fragmented and includes various national distributors, as
well as regional and local distributors with a more limited market share. We are the largest
independent distributor in France, holding a market share of approximately 22% as of
December 31, 2012.

# Business

#### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, where we generated 90% of our revenue
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We also hold a strong regional position in the
Polish light vehicle IAM, where we generated 10% of our revenue over the same period. With
over 50 years of experience in the market, we believe that as of December 31, 2012, we held a
market share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle
IAM. The IAM has demonstrated resilience in recent years and currently benefits from
advantageous long-term trends. Our scale provides us with significant purchasing power with
aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our extensive network throughout France allows us to
deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each our four business lines, featuring approximately
1.7 million spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our
wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these
parts, equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for
light vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and
operate under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned
distributors to garages represented 75% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 25% of our
revenue in France over the same period. As of October 31, 2013, we had a network of 48 whollyowned distributors and 44 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors
operated out of 489 distribution sites which are supplied either by our three warehouses (one for
each of light vehicle parts, light vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts) or through direct
shipments from suppliers. We use a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure
the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by tracking product
availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. In Poland, we operated three warehouses and
43 distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than
125,000 end-customers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages.
Approximately 3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an
affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in
return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their
preferred distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from
central purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in
the markets in which we operate.

Our leading market positions, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we generated revenue of €1,129 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €53.1 million. We are currently in exclusive negotiations regarding the
Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR is a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light
vehicles. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated adjusted EBITDA of
€6.6 million, and we have in addition identified €6.0 million of cost and purchasing savings per
year that we will seek to realize in large part by having ACR purchase spare parts under our
existing arrangements with our suppliers, which provide for more advantageous terms.

-----

Of the €730.6 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
year ended December 31, 2012, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted for
approximately 51%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately 16%;
truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 10%; and equipment and
tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 23%. The remaining
€246.0 million of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 was generated by sales to
affiliated independent distributors.

#### Our strengths

**_Leading distributor in the profitable and resilient independent light vehicle and truck_**
**_aftermarket sector_**

_Profitable and resilient sector_

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car park”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has proven resilient
during recent economic downturns even as new car sales decline. For example, the French light
vehicle and truck aftermarket increased by 1.3% between 2008 and 2011. This resilience is due in
part to several beneficial trends which we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a
stable car park size, a continuing increase in the average age of the car park, increasingly
complex and technologically advanced vehicle parts and advantageous regulatory schemes in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in
which we operate has led to an increase in the average age of the car park, resulting in more cars
that are beyond the manufacturer warranty period and are in need of repair and maintenance.
Independent garages sourcing IAM-provided spare parts provide value for owners of such older
cars looking for an alternative to more expensive manufacturer dealers’ garages.

According to WOLK, the French IAM, which represented 56% of the revenues generated by the
light vehicle parts aftermarket in France in 2011, is expected to remain stable between 2011 and
2015.

_Leading position_

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in
France, with over 50 years of experience. As of December 31, 2012, we held an estimated market
share of approximately 22% in terms of revenue in the fragmented light vehicle IAM. Our
leading position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand and our extensive distribution network
provide us with a strong platform to deliver a broad range of spare parts, equipment and tools
on a timely and efficient basis. We also enjoy a strong regional position in the light vehicle IAM
in Poland through our wholly-owned distributors in southern Poland.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive distribution network
organized around our central purchasing departments, three specialized national warehouses
and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for direct supply of spare parts
and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are handled separately from our
logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the supplier, we use a customized IT
system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain and distribution system by
tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our distribution system is also
capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to efficiently handle high
volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and, ultimately, driving increased
customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution system taking into account
each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our operational flexibility and
efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of service to our customers. Our

102


-----

vertically integrated distribution system and network of distributors and end-customers provide
us with a competitive advantage in France over smaller operators because smaller operators lack
our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a founding partner of
the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest international purchasing networks
for spare parts, which further enhances our purchasing power, allows us to obtain significant
rebates and complements our leading position in France by giving us access to best-practices of
other AD International partners abroad. We believe that the advantages of our vertically
integrated distribution system are difficult to replicate, because the significant time and
resources that would be required to reproduce our existing infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a very
large customer base of light vehicle and truck garages (which include independent garages, body
shops, fast fitters, fleet garages and car centers). We serve more than 125,000 end-customers in
France, including our approximately 3,200 branded garages which we service through both our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors. For the twelve months ended October 31,
2013, 75% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to garages through our whollyowned distributors, and 25% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated
independent distributors that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient
distribution network and our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on
a timely and efficient basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to
develop and maintain our large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers
targeted by our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not
overlap due to the commercial arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated
independent distributors.

**_High-quality service and highly efficient operations based on customized IT systems and_**
**_extensive product portfolio_**

_High-quality service_

Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately 1.7 million spare parts from over 300 suppliers.
Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platform allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items
and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online
business-to-business car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and
Truckissimo, respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly
order from a large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby
improving the customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe these web
portals provide us with a competitive advantage, and almost €100 million of our revenue from
sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated
independent distributors for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013 were placed through
our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services we offer
drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.

_Customized IT system_

Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. We have recently upgraded the warehouse IT management system of our
light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the process of
upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a tablet-based
program allowing our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and to make
suggestions for purchases based on the customer profile. We believe that our IT systems provide
us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a timely and
efficient basis.

103


-----

As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts and equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to
operate efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our
market-leading positions. As a result we have made, and expect to continue to make in the
future, judicious investments in IT.

_Extensive product portfolio_

We believe our suppliers view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for
the IAM, which allows us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse
range of suppliers. This is because we are one of the few distributors in our market that has the
scale, warehouse logistics and distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and
distribute a large number of spare parts and equipment and tools for an increasingly complex
market. The number of car and truck brands and models in the car park continues to increase
and, as a result, the related assortment of car and truck spare parts increases each year. We
believe that our extensive product portfolio, combined with our extensive range of services,
makes us attractive to the growing number of multi-brand garages who are moving away from
single-brand manufacturer-specific dealers.

**_Stable financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light business model_**

During the last three fiscal years, we generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA
margin from 2.7% to 4.5%, and maintained stable cash flow generation even during the recent
economic downturn, with cash conversion (defined as the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA
converted to cash) between 56.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 82.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2012. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we achieved an
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.7%. We have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement during
the last three years by implementing a series of profit improvement measures, and since these
measures were implemented, our EBITDA has increased by approximately €30 million in the
twelve months ended October 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. These
measures include: improved purchasing by our central purchasing departments and increased
group-wide purchasing (including our affiliated independent distributors) to maximize rebates;
reductions in the cost of local management and administration through the implementation of
shared services; and reductions in transportation and logistics costs by optimizing truck routes
and increasing the use of central distribution facilities. In addition, we improved our cash flows
from operating activities from €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to
€39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

We operate a capex-light business model using rented facilities, and thus our operations do not
require us to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the twelve months ended
October 31, 2013, our capital expenditures amounted to 1.4% of our revenue and primarily
consisted of IT investments, such as upgrades to our warehouse IT management system and sales
IT systems, as well as expenditures for maintenance of our distribution facilities. Our low levels of
capital expenditures (as a percentage of revenue) have allowed us to invest in our business,
maintain our leading market positions, improve operating efficiency and achieve deleveraging
through Adjusted EBITDA growth.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsors led by_**
**_TowerBrook_**

Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, our CEO (France), Stéphane Antiglio, and our Group CFO, Christophe
Gouthière, have more than 70 years of combined experience in the distribution and light vehicle
sectors and have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth
strategies. Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, is the former co-CEO of the Rhiag Group, a leading
distributor in the Italian, Swiss and Eastern European light vehicle aftermarkets, and has
extensive experience in the light vehicle aftermarket. Our CEO (France), Stéphane Antiglio, is the
former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Our Group
CFO, Christophe Gouthière, was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading
distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our Chairman, CEO (France) and Group CFO, supported
by an experienced management team, have successfully implemented the profit improvement
plan. We believe that the success of our management team in completing our profit
improvement plan and returning our business to profitable growth has laid a solid foundation

104

for further growth and increased profitability. The support and investment experience of our
sponsors led by TowerBrook supplement the leadership and knowledge of our management
team.

#### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience, we believe that we are well positioned
to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light vehicle IAM. To accomplish
this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our sales force performance and
practices, and develop new key accounts. As part of this strategy, we are currently in exclusive
negotiations regarding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR is a specialized distributor in
France of spare parts for light vehicles. We also intend to expand our geographic coverage in the
French truck IAM, in part by making selective, local acquisitions.

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a CAGR of 16.3% between 2010 and 2012.
We believe that we are well positioned to further win new contracts with insurance companies
for our collision repair services and to channel this business to our branded garages due to our
high levels of service and lower prices, thereby strengthening our partnerships among branded
garages and insurers and increasing demand for the provision of collision repair parts from our
distributors. To this end, we have expanded our call center for our collision repair services and
have set up a separate sales department to target insurance clients, and we intend to further
develop our collision business line’s logistics platform to handle the expected increased demand
for these collision repair services.

**_Enhance customer service_**

_Logistics_

We intend to continue to enhance the high-quality service we provide to customers by ensuring
seamless execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already extensive
product assortment. We believe that the range of spare parts on offer, efficient and effective
order execution, and timely product delivery will continue to drive customer loyalty. We plan to
shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. If we acquire ACR, we
believe that we will benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its
specialization in deliveries within two to four hours of order.

_Products_

We seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to capture
market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand our
portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line and, if
we acquire ACR, the private label product line of ACR for the light vehicle and truck aftermarket.
We also plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We believe this approach will
allow us to address different types of customers with different value propositions, ultimately
optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase in private label product lines as
a percentage of our total revenues will improve our competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources

105


-----

and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations, reduce
fixed costs and increase variability in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further
standardize our central administration and to enhance our IT support in order to implement
these changes. We also plan to invest in supply chain tools and methodologies aimed at
improving our product distribution framework in order to maximize customer service and
inventory efficiency. By further enhancing existing software and installing new software, such as
the recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics
platform, we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of orders. If we
acquire ACR, we also believe that such acquisition will enable us to group express deliveries and
centralize product returns in a single logistics platform.

We also intend to further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our Adjusted EBITDA
margin in Poland pursuant to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
parts IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, we believe that,
if we acquire ACR, the corresponding scale increase will allow us to further improve our
purchasing performance. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the share of purchases made
by our affiliated independent distributors through our central purchasing departments, which we
expect will further increase our sales volumes and improve our purchasing power.

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 20% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, that target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. As part of this strategy, we are currently in
exclusive negotiations regarding the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. ACR serves online light
vehicle spare parts retailers, and offers us exposure to this segment of the IAM. Whether an
order is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely over-thecounter product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to online-only light
vehicle spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts. We
regularly assess the compatibility of our do-it-yourself sales with our existing business-to-business
objectives in terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our do-it-yourself
sales on our business-to-business sales. ACR’s primary customers are online spare parts retailers,
and as a result the Contemplated ACR Acquisition would provide us with additional exposure to
this market.

#### History

We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation between a number of existing
independent light vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key link throughout
France between original equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and
local spare parts distributors, garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand.
In 1983 we expanded our footprint throughout France, both at the distributor level and the
garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and rolling out our concept
of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers and were independent from
Autodistribution. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors
and trailers. It was the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France.

In 2007, we entered the Polish market by purchasing three local distributors who currently form
the core distributors of AD Polska. In 2009, we entered the Italian market and formed AD Italy.
We sold our majority stake in AD Italy in 2012.

Throughout our history, we have expanded our business through strategic acquisitions. We
enhanced our logistics platform through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading independent French

106


-----

distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair, in 2005 and Bremstar, a distributor with a
logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008. We also acquired
Enssemble, a network of light vehicle spare parts distributors, in 2012, and FPLS, a truck spare
parts distributor, in 2013. In December 2013, we acquired Rougon Queyrel, a distributor of spare
parts for light vehicles in southeastern France.

Having realized at an early stage that internet offered innovative opportunities for light vehicle
and truck spare parts distributors, we created the Autossimo online business-to-business light
vehicle repair and maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online business-tobusiness truck repair and maintenance web portal in 2001. We have also developed our own
private label, ISOTECH, which features spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks, such as
batteries and lubricants, and was re-launched in 2008.

We were acquired by our two current principal shareholders, Investcorp and TowerBrook, in 2006
and 2009, respectively. See “Principal shareholders.”

_Safeguard_

Between February 18, 2009 and April 6, 2009, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor were subject
to safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) opened by the Commercial Court of Evry.

Safeguard proceedings in France are a commercial court-led process opened on a voluntary basis
by a company in which such company seeks court protection from creditors in order to achieve a
restructuring plan.

In 2009, before the opening of our safeguard proceedings in February, we signed a restructuring
agreement with our creditors approving our debt restructuring and our equity-financed majority
acquisition by TowerBrook. The safeguard proceedings allowed the Issuer and the Parent
Guarantor to confirm and implement the restructuring plan contemplated in the restructuring
agreement, thereby reducing the impact of the restructuring on our primary operating company
Autodistribution S.A., its central purchasing departments, its subsidiaries and its network, which
were not materially affected by this procedure and continued to operate in the ordinary course
of business.

On April 6, 2009, the Commercial Court of Evry adopted safeguard plans for the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor, thereby ending the safeguard proceedings in respect of the Issuer and the
Parent. Since then, the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor have been operating outside safeguard
proceedings and their relationships with their creditors, which debt was restructured within
safeguard proceedings, are governed by their respective safeguard plans.

_As of the Issue Date:_

  - At the level of the Issuer, when the Existing Senior Facilities and Hedge Promissory Note
are fully repaid, the Issuer will have repaid all the restructured debt governed by the
existing safeguard plan, using its ability under its safeguard plan to prepay such debt.

  - At the level of the Parent Guarantor, when the EP Bonds are fully repaid (the Parent
Guarantor using its ability under its safeguard plan to prepay such debt), the Parent
Guarantor will remain subject to the safeguard plan only for the purpose of the
Contingent Value Instruments, which terms will remain applicable in full. The Parent
Guarantor safeguard plan will terminate on April 6, 2016 or following the expiration or
repayment of the Contingent Value Instruments, if earlier.

_Contemplated ACR Acquisition_

Following the conclusion of a fulsome due diligence process, the Parent Guarantor has been
granted a period of exclusivity to negotiate with ACR’s shareholders with respect to a potential
acquisition of ACR and its subsidiary by Autodistribution S.A. The exclusive negotiations are on
the basis of an enterprise value for ACR of between €55 and €65 million. Autodistribution
S.A. and ACR have agreed to initiate the works council consultation processes to proceed with
the Contemplated ACR Acquisition. Under these consultation processes, the applicable works
councils will have a period of time to review and give their opinion on the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition, but are not required to approve, and do not have the right to veto, the

107


-----

Contemplated ACR Acquisition. These works council consultation processes are required to be
completed prior to entry into any definitive agreement in respect of the Contemplated ACR
Acquisition. We expect these consultation processes to take at least 15 days from January 14,
2014, date they were initiated.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, ACR generated revenue of €68.9 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €6.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, ACR
generated a revenue of €68.0 million and €61.1 million respectively. For each period, ACR
generated adjusted EBITDA of €5.7 million and €5.1 million respectively. ACR is a distributor of
spare parts for light vehicles in France, and serves a diverse customer base, comprising primarily
autocenters, fast-fitters and online spare parts distributors. ACR mainly distributes braking
systems, rotating electrics (alternators and starters), engine environment (filters and exhausts)
and clutches and transmission. For the year ended December 31, 2012, ACR’s revenue was derived
from distributors (37%), web dealers (35%), auto centers and fast-fitters (16%), car dealers (5%),
special markets (4%) and export (3%). We believe that the Contemplated ACR Acquisition would
allow us to grow our market share in the French light vehicle aftermarket and enable us to
realize further significant procurement, logistics and distribution savings and cost efficiencies.

#### Our geographic markets

We primarily distribute our products in France and have a total of 48 wholly-owned and 44
affiliated independent distributors, as well as approximately 3,200 branded garages, which
participate in an affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support
from us, and in return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated
as their preferred distributor. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, 90% of our
revenue was generated by our operations in France. We have an extensive distribution network
in France for our light vehicle spare parts business line, with distributors in every region of the
country. Our central management and headquarters and most of our central purchasing
functions are located in Arcueil, near Paris. Two of our logistics platforms, Logisteo (which
distributes light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair) and Bremstar (which distributes truck
parts for maintenance and repair), are located in Moissy Cramayel and Pringy, in the Seine-etMarne department. Our Cora logistics platform (which distributes light vehicle parts for collision
repair) is located in Chaponnay and Corbas, in the Rhone department.

We also operate in Poland, where we are a leading light vehicle spare parts distributor, with a
distribution network of three warehouses and 43 wholly-owned distributors. For the twelve
months ended October 31, 2013, 10% of our revenue was generated by our operations in Poland.

#### Our product lines

We provide light vehicle and truck spare parts in each of the following segments of the
aftermarket: (i) light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair; (ii) light vehicle parts for collision
repair; (iii) truck parts for maintenance and repair; and (iv) equipment and tools for garages in both
the IAM and OES.

Our product portfolio includes a broad range of parts that are used in light vehicles and trucks,
including brake systems, steering and suspensions parts, heating and cooling systems, engines and
exhausts, chassis components, windscreens, oils and electrical products. Other products range from
vehicle body parts, such as headlights and bumpers, to body panels and engine overhaul products.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived approximately 51% of our revenue from the
distribution of spare parts for the maintenance and repair of light vehicles. 31 of our 48 whollyowned distributors and 34 of our 44 affiliated independent distributors sell a full range of light
vehicle parts for maintenance and repair, including engine parts, brakes and batteries, in all
regions of France through 358 distribution sites.

We also distribute spare parts for the maintenance and repair of light vehicles to independent
garages, including 2,341 branded garages (as of October 31, 2013). This network includes 1,176
“AD” branded garages, of which 848 are designated “Garage AD Expert,” identifying them as
providing end-customers with both routine maintenance and more complex repair services; seven
AD Autoservices, which are multi-service garages offering maintenance, repair and bodywork
services; 1,105 Auto Primo garages; and 53 Staff Auto garages. We developed our network of
branded garages based on population density in particular areas. For example, in rural areas we
aim to have one branded garage for every 15,000 inhabitants living within a 15-kilometer radius
of that garage. Our branded garages perform repair services for all major light vehicle brands
and models and use our integrated diagnostic tools.

Further, we have entered into service agreements for light vehicle parts for maintenance and
repair with companies with large light vehicle fleets, as well as partnerships with fast-fitters and
car centers.

_Private label_

In 2008, we re-launched our private label ISOTECH product line, which currently comprises eight
product groups sold under our AD brand for the light vehicle aftermarket, including batteries,
lubricants, timing kits, water pumps and braking components. Our ISOTECH products are
currently offered at a discount rate of approximately 15% compared to prevailing market prices,
but generate a higher margin for us than third-party branded products.

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Autossimo, which is an online business-to-business
light vehicle repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops with an online catalog
of more than 1.5 million spare parts, representing over 430 different original equipment

109


-----

suppliers. The website offers continuously updated technical databases and management tools,
such as an easy-to-use portal outlining repair methods, connected diagnostic and costing tools,
parts identification tools, price comparison tools by brands, inventory access and an online
ordering platform.

**_Light vehicle parts for collision repair_**

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived approximately 16% of our revenue from the
sale of light vehicle parts for collision repair. The collision repair products that we distribute
include a wide range of integrated products and include individual parts and entire body
components. We manage our collision repair services through three-way partnerships among
independent garages, insurers and us.

We also distribute light vehicle parts for collision repair to independent body shops including,
582 branded body shops (as of October 31, 2013) operating under the “Carosserie AD” brand. We
use our specialized logistics platform Cora for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision
repair to wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.

_Website_

We also have our own call center which directly serves the customers of insurance companies.
Furthermore, we are in the process of developing the website “Carrossimo,” which is an online
business-to-business collision repair portal for body shops.

**_Truck parts for maintenance and repair_**

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived approximately 10% of our revenue from the
distribution of truck spare parts, for which we are the leading independent distributor in France
(based on our geographic network). Our subsidiary Bremstar offers over 8,600 truck spare parts
from 19 suppliers which we generally stock in our warehouses for shipment on an expedited
basis. As of October 31, 2013, 27 wholly-owned distributors and 25 affiliated independent
distributors were selling truck parts for maintenance and repair.

We also distribute truck parts for maintenance and repair to 179 branded truck garages in France
(as of October 31, 2013) operating under our AD brands, of which 107 were wholly-owned and
72 were independent affiliates. We use our specialized logistics platform Bremstar for the
delivery of truck parts for maintenance and repair to our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors. We increased our footprint in the truck aftermarket by
acquiring FPLS, a truck parts distributor, in 2013. We also entered into a partnership in 2012 with
TIP Trailer Services, a trailer rental service business in Europe which has a fleet of approximately
48,000 trucks, pursuant to which we provide truck parts for the maintenance and repair of the
fleet of TIP Trailer Services.

_Private label_

Our ISOTECH product line for truck parts for maintenance and repair currently comprises five
groups of products which are sold under our AD brand for the truck aftermarket, such as
batteries, lubricant, water pumps or headlights.

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Truckissimo, which is an online business-to-business
truck repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops. The website offers
continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use portal
outlining repair methods, connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price
comparison tools by brand and inventory access.

**_Equipment, tools and other_**

For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived approximately 23% of our revenue from the
distribution and maintenance of equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair,
by our wholly-owned distributors. We have a comprehensive equipment and tool product
offering, which includes garage equipment, such as light vehicles lifts and diagnostic tools,
personal safety equipment and tools, as well as a wide range of technical parts such as lambda
sensors, flow meters and turbochargers. We also provide installation and other after-sales

services for these products. Furthermore, we have developed Diag’issimo, an interface which
connects leading diagnostic tools with the Autossimo online light vehicle repair and maintenance
portal, providing garages with an integrated solution from diagnostics to spare parts order
placement.

#### Our distribution platforms and end-customers

_France_

In France we purchase light vehicle parts and sell them (i) through our wholly-owned distributors
to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers and (ii) to affiliated independent
distributors. We have a similar distribution model for collision repair, for which our subsidiary
Cora acts as central purchasing department and warehouse, and for spare parts for trucks, for
which our subsidiary Bremstar acts as central purchasing department and warehouse. For the
twelve months ended October 31, 2013, our wholly-owned distributors generated 75.5% of our
revenue through sales of spare parts to garages and over-the-counter sales, and our sales to
affiliated independent distributors generated approximately 24.5% of our revenue. For the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, approximately 4% of the revenue generated by our
independent affiliated distributors was derived from sales by our logistics platforms Cora and
Bremstar.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our wholly-owned distributors generated a net revenue
of €730.6 million, or 74.8% of our total net revenue, through sales of spare parts to garages and
over-the-counter sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our logistics platforms generated 25.2% of our revenue.
Our Logisteo platform generated gross revenue of €553.0 million. After deduction of
intercompany sales to wholly-owned distributors, the net revenue from sales to affiliated
independent distributors for the year ended December 31, 2012 was €208.8 million, or 21.4% of
our total revenue. Our Cora and Bremstar logistics platforms generated a net revenue of
€37.1 million, or 3.8% of our total net revenue.

As of October 31, 2013, we had a broad network of 48 wholly-owned distributors and 44
affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out of 489 distribution
sites which are supplied either by our three warehouses (one for light vehicle parts, one for
collision repair parts and one for truck parts) or through direct shipments from the supplier to
the distributor. Sixty-five of our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors distribute light vehicle spare parts from 358 distribution sites and 52 of our whollyowned and affiliated independent distributors distribute truck spare parts from 131 distribution
sites.

We obtain rebates from our suppliers because we purchase products on a large scale, thereby
allowing our central purchasing departments to negotiate favorable contracts with our suppliers.
We pass on a portion of these rebates to affiliated independent distributors, and our whollyowned distributors pass on a portion of these rebates when they sell spare parts to garages.

Both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors on-sell to a variety of
end-customers, including independent light vehicle garages, over-the-counter sales, truck fleets,
car dealers, and auto centers and fast-fitters. As of the year ended December 31, 2012, networkwide sales to these end-customers totaled €1.3 billion.

The following graph shows the percentage of revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors
in France by end-customer type for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013.

Garages require up to eight deliveries per day and, in the case of certain fast-moving parts (parts
for which there is a high demand), may require delivery within two hours of order. We provide
next business day deliveries for slow-moving items (parts for which there is a lower demand).
Garages also need technical support to assist them with diagnostics, the identification of parts
and repair methods, and the ordering of tools. Garages also require frequent training, as spare
parts and related repairs become more technologically complex. We provide all these services,
replicating for garages what light vehicle manufacturers provide for their own affiliated network
of garages, but with the added complexity of providing these services for all light vehicle models.

We also provide truck spare parts to truck fleet companies, which are equipment services
providers that specialize in the leasing and rental of trailers, tankers and other equipment, as
well as possibly maintenance, damage repair, fleet management and telematics, requiring the
truck fleet company to have truck spare parts readily available or delivered in a short period of
time.

In addition, we distribute spare parts through our wholly-owned distributors to over-the-counter
customers, including, among others, semi-professional and “do-it-yourself” customers. Our overthe-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 20% of our
revenue for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013.

_Poland_

Our Polish distribution system is similar to our French distribution system, except that in Poland
we distribute parts only to wholly-owned distributors. Our three warehouses in Poland store over
50,000 spare parts and distribute these parts to our wholly-owned distributors, which sell them to
garages and shops, most of which are located in the south of Poland. For the twelve months
ended October 31, 2013, 40% of our revenue in Poland was generated by sales to retail shops,
28% was generated by sales to garages, and 32% was generated by sales to car centers and
others. Our distributors are able to make up to eight deliveries per day to our customers, which
helps to ensure the loyalty of our customers. We have also developed a network of more than
300 branded garages, including 170 AD Garages, in order to increase our brand recognition in
Poland. Our Polish distributors primarily use their website sales platform to generate and track
orders, with sales through this platform accounting for more than 59% of our revenue in Poland
for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We also have three call centers and over 100 sales
staff in Poland.

#### Supply and procurement

Our distribution system is organized around our three central purchasing departments, which
buy aftermarket spare parts and, equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to
our wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. Our three central
purchasing departments are: Logisteo for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair; Cora for

112


-----

light vehicle parts for collision repair; and Bremstar for truck parts for maintenance and repair.
These central purchasing departments implement our procurement policy and negotiate prices
for the approximately 1.7 million spare parts that we purchase directly from over 300 suppliers.
We buy substantially all of the products that we distribute directly from spare parts
manufacturers, which we believe allows us to use our scale and centralized purchasing function
to obtain favorable prices, rebates and other terms.

We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. For
example, we select our brake or battery suppliers every three years. When selecting our suppliers,
we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as a supplier’s
ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. We enter into annually renewable
contracts with our suppliers, which include standard terms and conditions, such as logistics
rebates or inflation adjustments for pricing. We negotiate supplier rebates on an annual basis.
These supplier rebates comprise monthly bonuses on commercial and logistics services, as well as
year-end rebates based on annual thresholds achieved. While negotiating these contracts, our
scale and our central purchasing function allow obtaining optimal terms. We also invoice on a
monthly basis additional services linked to direct deliveries from our suppliers to our whollyowned and affiliated independent distributors, as well as deliveries by suppliers to our
warehouses, or related logistics services.

We use our central purchasing system to monitor customer purchases across our network and
quickly change our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand. We seek to buy in large
quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offsets the costs associated with
maintaining large inventories at our warehouses.

We also benefit from our AD International membership, a cross-border partnership among
distributors of aftermarket spare parts that allows members to benefit from reduced purchase
pricing through negotiations with suppliers on the basis of consolidated volumes, common
marketing concepts and best-practice sharing. For the year ended December 31, 2012, AD
International had members in 31 countries that generated €5.5 billion of revenue (in aggregate).

During the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, our top 25 suppliers in France accounted for
57.1% of our purchases (excluding purchases through Cora and Bremstar). Our largest supplier in
France, Robert Bosch, accounted for 9.2% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar) and
our second-largest supplier, Filtrauto, accounted for 3.9% of our purchases (excluding Cora and
Bremstar). Except for Robert Bosch, no supplier in France accounts for more than 3.9% of our
total purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar) as of October 31, 2013.

#### Logistics

We operate three central logistics platforms (for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair,
for light vehicle parts for collision repair and for truck parts for maintenance and repair) to allow
both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors to respond to
customer expectations in terms of product availability and timely delivery. Our three central
logistics platforms are:

  - Logisteo (2008): Logisteo is our central warehouse from which spare parts for light
vehicle repair and maintenance are distributed. As of October 31, 2013, it was the largest
independent logistics platform for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France
and had over 20,000 square meters of storage space and stored over 50,000 spare parts
references of 135 brands. It supplies 482 distribution sites and employs 234 people.
Deliveries of regular orders are made within four business days and express orders within
the next business day.

  - Bremstar (2008): Bremstar was established in 1995, and we acquired it in 2008. It
distributes truck parts for maintenance and repair. It has over 2,000 square meters of
storage space and stores over 8,600 spare parts references. It supplies all of the 131 truck
distribution sites and employs 32 people (as of October 31, 2013). Deliveries of express
orders are made by the next business day and regular orders are made within five business
days.

113


-----

  - Cora (2005): Cora was established in 1967, and we acquired it in 2005. It distributes light
vehicle parts for collision repairs and has over 26,000 square meters of storage space. It
stores over 50,000 spare parts references from 35 brands. Orders placed before 5:30 p.m.
are delivered the next business day.

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, we delivered approximately 35% of products
sold in France to both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors through our
three specialized logistics platforms. Spare parts manufacturers deliver the other 65% of products
sold in France directly to our distributors. We plan to increase the amount of orders delivered
through our logistics platforms, which allows for bulk purchases on favorable conditions.

Shipment of products from our warehouses to our distribution network is carried out through
independent carriers. Our logistics department is also responsible for setting performance targets
and related incentives and penalties, while continuously monitoring the performance of thirdparty carriers in order to improve customer service. We plan and monitor product flows through
our IT systems. We lease, rather than own, our distribution centers, thereby limiting our
permanent investment in fixed assets. The logistics department of each of our Logisteo, Cora and
Bremstar logistics platforms has the following primary responsibilities:

  - Inbound _logistics:_ Accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring
compliance with the supply specifications negotiated by our supply chain department.

  - Stocking: Determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product, and the shelf
placement in accordance with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of
products within the dedicated space is crucial to optimize the available space in each of
our distribution centers.

  - Picking, packing and outbound logistics: The space management practices carried out by
our logistics department allows us to maximize efficiency in locating and retrieving
products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If products have
not been previously packaged by the suppliers, the logistics department is able to carry out
this activity.

  - Shipping: Organizing and monitoring transportation.

#### Our contracts

In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into various contractual arrangements with our
suppliers, affiliated independent distributors, wholly-owned distributors and branded garages.

  - Suppliers: Our contracts with our suppliers are typically entered into for a one-year term,
without automatic renewal, and may include supply specifications regarding the lead time,
the frequency of deliveries and packaging, and the achievement by suppliers of certain
performance targets. These targets are continuously monitored to ensure that our
inventory is managed effectively and to improve customer service. Bonuses or penalties
may apply on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether targets are reached or not.
Inventory levels in the distribution centers are monitored by applying calculation
procedures which may take into account, among other things, current inventory levels and
past analysis of customer demand.

  - Affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors: Our contractual
arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and
commercial contracts. Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent
distributors agree to operate under the AD brand and to receive our support services in
exchange for a membership fee. Our central purchasing departments enter into
commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors, which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both
affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors, and our affiliated
independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases made through our central
purchasing departments account for typically at least 70% of their overall purchase
volumes.

  - Branded garages: We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to
which they become branded garages in exchange for a membership fee.

114


-----

#### Sales

Our sales department is responsible for managing relationships with existing customers and
establishing relationships with new customers, setting sales targets and implementing sales
policies, which includes customer payment terms in cooperation with the finance and control
department and managing payment collection in cooperation with the administration
department.

Our sales department is divided between our two principal business lines, light vehicles and
trucks.

  - Light vehicles: This division supports our light vehicle spare parts distribution business. It
operates at the central level, regional and local levels in order to address the fragmented
market of light vehicle parts distributors, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

  - Trucks: This division supports our truck spare parts distribution business. It operates at
the central, regional and local levels, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

#### Marketing and advertising

Our marketing department is located in our headquarters in Arcueil (near Paris) and is focused on
improving awareness and perception of our brand. Our marketing and advertising expenses were
€2.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013. We market our distribution services
to both affiliated independent distributors and garages, and engage in joint marketing
campaigns with our suppliers that target garage end-customers.

We continuously invest in our marketing efforts in order to sustain our sales and upgrade our
existing products. Our websites are one of our main marketing tools. They receive an average of
150,000 individual visits per month. We also regularly organize promotional campaigns for
certain of the light vehicle and truck spare parts that we distribute.

#### Information technology

Our IT department is located in Morangis (near Paris) and plays an important role in our
distribution process and operations, since we rely on it to manage our sales, supply chain and
internal control. Our IT department supports our sales department, purchasing department,
logistics department and accounting department.

Our IT department, in coordination with our sales department, has developed software to
integrate our logistics platforms with an electronic interface which allows our customers to place
orders online and obtain information regarding the availability of the products that we
distribute, sales terms, conditions and shipping times. In 2012, our IT department also developed
an eBook for our sales department, a tablet-based program allowing our sales representatives to
see previous customer orders and to make suggestions for purchases based on the customer
profile.

Our IT department collaborates with our logistics department, primarily to update the software
and algorithms used to determine adequate inventory levels at our warehouses, product flows
and the optimal shelf positioning of the products that we distribute. For instance, we have
recently upgraded the warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform,
in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. Our IT system also enables us to determine
product availability in real time and update the inventories of our warehouses accordingly.

#### Intellectual property

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks in our business. Except for the
trademarks Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, Autossimo, AD PL, the “AD” logo,
the garage names associated with the “AD” logo and ISOTECH, which are recognized brands in
the industry, we do not believe that any of our other trade names, service marks or trademarks
are material to our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws
to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We are not currently engaged in any
material intellectual property litigation, nor do we know of any material intellectual property
claims outstanding.

115


-----

#### Employees

As of October 31, 2013, we employed 6,349 people, of whom 5,425 were employed in France
with 98% on a full-time basis.

The following table sets forth the number of employees as of October 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.

**As of October 31,**

In the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a result
of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes that were specific to us. We believe that our
relations with our employees are good.

We attach great importance to providing high-quality and expert service to our customers.
Maintaining and repairing complex light vehicles and trucks requires well-trained and skillful
employees. Selling light vehicle and truck spare parts and equipment and tools also requires
expertise regarding the products and their use. Therefore, we provide our employees with a
broad range of training.

To ensure the continued professional development of our employees, we have established a
comprehensive training program, through which approximately 35,000 training hours were
performed for the last twelve months.

We have also created the Institut AD, which offers a number of technical training modules
through specialized training organizations and equipment manufactures.

#### Competition

We face numerous sources of competition in the highly fragmented French and Polish spare parts
aftermarket in which we operate. See “Industry.”

Our main competitor in France is Alliance Automotive Group, which operates under four main
distribution networks in France: Groupauto, with 285 distribution sites; Precisium, with 293
distribution sites; Partner’s, with 231 distribution sites; and GEFA, with 143 distribution sites.
Alliance Automotive Group also operates ten different affiliation brands for light vehicle garages
and one affiliation brand of truck garages. Although the overall number of competitors has
decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the IAM remains very competitive. Customers
select spare parts suppliers based on a number of factors, including product range and product
availability, service level, price and value-added services.

Our main competitors in Poland include Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union Polska.

#### Properties

As of October 31, 2013, we operated a network of 48 wholly-owned distributors. As of
October 31, 2013, we leased substantially all of our warehouses and distribution sites.

#### Environment, health and safety

Although we do not manufacture the products we distribute, the storage of spare parts subjects
our facilities and operations to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws govern, among other
things, discharges of pollutants, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and waste,
and the clean-up of contaminated properties. Violations of environmental laws, applicable
authorizations or permits can result in significant fines or civil or criminal sanctions. In addition,
the discovery of contamination at our facilities could require us to incur substantial clean-up
costs.

116


-----

Environmental authorizations or permits required for some of our operations may be reviewed,
modified or revoked by the issuing authorities. We believe that we are in material compliance
with the environmental laws applicable to our business. Our environmental and occupational
health and safety costs have not significantly affected our results of operations or financial
position during the previous twelve months.

#### Insurance

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business,
including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fleet, damages and losses and IT risk
insurance. All of our policies are underwritten with reputable insurance providers, and we
conduct yearly reviews of our insurance coverage with our broker and our insurance providers.
We believe that our insurance policies provide sufficient coverage of the risks facing our business.

#### Legal proceedings

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of our business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers, disputes with our
lessors at the renewal of our commercial leases and intellectual property disputes. We are not
currently involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are
expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We
note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be difficult to predict and we offer no
assurance in this regard.

_Klarius S.A.S. vs. Autodistributions S.A._

On September 10, 2008, Klarius S.A.S., a manufacturer of light vehicle spare parts for
maintenance and repair in France, commenced proceedings against us and our subsidiaries
before the Chartres Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce), claiming that we unfairly
terminated our established commercial relationship with them. We argued that Klarius S.A.S.’s
claim was not valid, since Klarius S.A.S. would have never started legal proceedings against us,
but for its financial distress, because Klarius S.A.S. was declared bankrupt on March 26, 2008.
However, the Chartres Commercial Court rejected our argument on June 5, 2012 and found that
Klarius S.A.S. had a valid claim. This proceeding is still pending and there will be a procedural
hearing on January 24, 2014. Klarius S.A.S. is claiming €2.4 million in damages. We dispute the
merits of this claim and no provision in respect thereof has been created in our financial accounts
as of December 31, 2012.

# Regulation

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Some of the most pertinent to the_
_business sector in which we operate are laws and regulations that pertain to the light vehicle and_
_truck wholesale sector and light vehicle inspections. The paragraphs below briefly describe some_
_of that laws and regulations (focusing on French and EU laws and regulations). This section does_
_not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the laws and regulations to which we are_
_subject and that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes._

#### European Union

The sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts’ wholesale and repair and maintenance services
are currently regulated in the European Union by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”),
which replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) in 2010. Unlike BER 2002, the
New BER does not apply to the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which remain
covered by BER 2002 until May 31, 2013 and by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly, the material
scope of the New BER is now limited to the distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair
and maintenance services for motor vehicles.

The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the
Application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical
agreements and concerted practices, the “General BER”) and the corresponding EU Guidelines on
Vertical Restraints.

These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that
original and equivalent spare parts competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred
to as “passenger car” under the New BER) and trucks (referred to as “commercial vehicles” under
the New BER) manufacturers have full access to the market.

Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck
spare parts and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of
Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which
prohibits anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, if they comply with the provisions
of both:

  - the General BER, which only applies if:

    - both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and

    - the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General
BER; and

  - the New BER, which implies that:

   - no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a
selective distribution system under which a supplier is obligated to sell its goods or
services under a contract only to selected distributors on the basis of specific criteria and
by committing to not sell such goods or services to non-unauthorized resellers;

    - no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts to freely sell such goods to
independent or authorized distributors or garages or end-users; and

    - no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of
motor vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and
easily on the components supplied or on spare parts.

   - Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the
New BER are not applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints
cover more than 50% of a relevant market.

    - The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts which do not fulfill
the conditions of the General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the
European Commission, is likely to be the case for most agreements) may nonetheless
benefit from an individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in
Article 101(3) of the TFEU.

118


-----

   - In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (“European Commission’s
Supplementary Guidelines on Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair
of Vehicles and for the Distribution of Replacement Parts for Vehicles”), which provides
some guidelines on the application and interpretation of the New BER, further specifies
that it is very doubtful that selective distribution agreements that would contain any of
the two following restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3):

  - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including
independent repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair
equipment or tools, publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside
assistance operators, operators offering inspection and testing services, and operators
offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to the brand-specific technical
information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded motor vehicles
in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and

  - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its
authorized network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or
extended warranty may not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for
the end-user to have the repair and maintenance services not covered by the warranty
performed by a member of the network or (ii) on the obligation for the end-user to use
spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of replacements not covered by the
warranty.

The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services
marketed by independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of
alternative suppliers, thereby fostering competition between such articles (known as
“equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s trademark.

As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also
aims to protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby
ensuring that competing brands of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and
authorized repairers, as well as to parts wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that
the availability of such spare parts entails significant advantages for consumers especially since
there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the manufacturer and alternative
parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts bearing the
manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment
suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the
same notice, the European Commission specifies that in order to be considered to be of
“equivalent quality,” spare parts must be “of a sufficiently high quality that their use does not
endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that employs them. The European
Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the requirements for being
considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer.

In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable.
Accordingly, the French courts and Competition Authority assess vertical agreements entered into
in the sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and maintenance
services in light of these regulations and of the corresponding guidelines.

_Inspection_

European light vehicle inspections are currently regulated by the Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council of Europe dated as of May 6, 2009 (“Directive 2009/40/EC”), as
amended, providing for periodic technical inspections of each vehicle matriculated in a Member
State.

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks
permitted to operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2009/40/EC requires inspections to be made (i) four
years after the first utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles
with more than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than
3.5 tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be performed within one year from the first
utilization and every year thereafter.

119


-----

In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2009/40/EC have already been provided for in
the French Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties
can be imposed and may be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that
were suspended as a result of the inspection and may entail the confiscation of the vehicle
registration certificate (Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French Highway Code).

_Protection of design and models for “visible” parts_

In the absence of EU harmonization, each Member State remains free to govern the legal
protection of designs and models for “visible” parts. In France, according to the French
Intellectual Property Code, the distribution of “visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and

and an annual budget and, upon request, information relating to the financial condition of the
Group and/or any member of the Group; (ii) authorizations; (iii) compliance with laws and
regulations; (iv) no default; (v) the payment of taxes; (vi) the preservation of assets; (vii) FATCA;
(viii) anti-corruption; (ix) the maintenance of Guarantor and Security Coverage Test; (x) OFAC
sanctions; (xi) further assurance; (xii) holdco covenants; (xiii) change of business; and (xiv) no
change of COMI, in each case subject to exceptions and materiality thresholds.

**_Covenant suspension_**

The provision for suspension of certain covenants upon the Notes achieving investment-grade
status as set forth in the “Description of Senior Secured Notes,” shall also apply equally to the
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of control or a sale_**

Upon a sale of all or substantially all assets of the Group or an Adverse Corporate Decision (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) the facilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will be cancelled and all outstanding utilizations and all outstanding amounts
under any ancillary facility, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under
the Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall become
immediately due and payable and shall be repaid within three business days of such date.

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) the lenders
shall not be obligated to fund utilizations (other than rollover loans) and if a lender requests and
gives notice to the Agent, within 60 days of such Change of Control, that its commitments be
cancelled the Agent shall promptly notify the Parent, within five Business Days from such notice,
that such lender shall be required to be prepaid or replaced.

An Adverse Corporate Decision means any approval by the relevant corporate bodies of a holdco
or the Parent Guarantor of a resolution which results in: (i) any amendment to the majority rules
applicable to the appointment or revocation of (a) the management of the Parent Guarantor or
French Holdco (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement) which would have the direct or
indirect effect of Dutch Holdco (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement) (and/or Top
Dutchco) losing the right to appoint or revoke the management of the Parent Guarantor or the
Issuer acting solely or (b) DutchCo’s management which would have the direct or indirect effect
of Top Dutchco losing the right to appoint or revoke the management of DutchCo acting solely;
(ii) any change to the corporate form or nationality of each of the Parent Guarantor or a holdco
(other than changes of corporate form contemplated under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement); (iii) any written statement by Top Dutchco and or DutchCo affirming or asserting
that its “centre of main interests” within the meaning of the Regulation is not in the
Netherlands, or any decision by a court of law that such “centre of main interests” is not in the
Netherlands; (iv) any change of the registered office of any holdco or the Issuer (to the extent
that the jurisdiction (Etat) in which is situated the competent court for any bankruptcy
proceedings in respect of it would cease to be the same); (v) any change of the registered office
(statutaire zetel), offices (kantoor) or principal place of business of Top Dutchco or DutchCo to
any jurisdiction other than the Netherlands; or (vi) any merger or liquidation involving either the
Issuer and/or any holdco, in each case, unless made with the prior written consent of the Agent
acting upon instructions of the majority lenders.

**_Financial covenant_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with a Minimum EBITDA covenant
set at 45% headroom over the projected EBITDA as of the Issue Date with a mechanism that
adjusts this amount to reflect the closing of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition to the extent that
transaction completes by May 31, 2014. The financial covenant will be calculated and tested on
the second quarter following the Issuer Date and thereafter quarterly, provided that the failure
to satisfy such covenant when the Revolving Credit Facility is not drawn or outstanding shall not
be deemed to constitute or result in a Default or an Event of Default or a breach of the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement.

130


-----

To the extent that the Issuer is in breach of the Minimum EBITDA covenant, subject to certain
limitations as more fully detailed in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may cure
the covenant breach, by giving notice within five business days of delivery of a compliance
certificate for that relevant period of a new shareholder injection or a subordinated shareholder
loan by the date falling no later than 15 business days after such notice, and by paying down to
zero the outstanding utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Events of default_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain
adjustments as necessary) as under the Notes.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which
are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions,
baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) breach of financial covenant (subject
to certain equity cure rights); (ii) misrepresentations; (iii) cross-default to any Indebtedness above
€10 million; (iv) repudiation and rescission of finance documents; (v) unlawfulness; (vi) breach of
the Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) nonpayment default; (viii) compulsory acquisition; (ix) cessation
of business; (x) auditor’s qualification; and (xi) a Guarantor breach of any of its obligations under
any Finance Document (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

**_Governing law_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in
connection with it will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English
law although the restrictive covenants, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact
that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by, English
law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with the entry into the Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, the Issuer, the
direct shareholder of the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer will
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities among:
(i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility; (ii) any persons who accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging agreements (collectively, the “Hedging
Agreement”; the liabilities under such Hedging Agreements, the “Hedging Liabilities”; and any
persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to such Hedging
Agreements being referred to in such capacity as the “Hedge Counterparties”); (iii) the Trustee,
on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes (for the purpose of this “Description
_of certain financing arrangements,” the “Notes”) (the “Noteholders”) (the “Notes Trustee”);_
(iv) the intragroup creditors and debtors; and (v) certain direct or indirect shareholders of the
Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer or another member of the Group has
incurred or may incur in the future (including any subordinated shareholder loans).

   - In this description, “Group” refers to the Issuer and each of its subsidiaries.

  - Each member of the Group that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the
Revolving Credit Facility, in respect of the Notes or under any other Debt Document (as
defined in “—Further security and incremental borrowings”) is referred to as a “Debtor”
and are collectively referred to as the “Debtors.”

The Intercreditor Agreement will set forth:

  - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

  - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence
of certain insolvency events;

131


-----

  - turnover provisions; and

  - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to
transaction security (such assets, the “Collateral”; such security, the “Transaction Security”;
and the documents constituting such Transaction Security, the “Transaction Security
Documents”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be
incurred by the members of the Group, which is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit
Facility Documents (as defined below), the Notes Documents (as defined below), any Pari Passu
Debt Document (as defined below) and any Senior Unsecured Notes Document (as defined
below) to rank pari passu in right of payment with the liabilities under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the liabilities under the Indenture (for the purposes of this section, the
“Notes Indenture” and any existing Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below), then existing or, to
the extent not permitted under any Finance Document, with the consent of the relevant Creditor
Representatives (as defined below) under each such document (acting on the instructions of the
requisite level of creditors under such documents) and to be secured on the Collateral, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Debt”; the
creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Creditors”; the liabilities of the
Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the “Pari Passu Liabilities”; and the documents
creating or evidencing the Pari Passu Liabilities, the “Pari Passu Debt Documents”).

The Intercreditor Agreement will also include provisions relating to future indebtedness in the
form of senior unsecured notes (such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes,” the
liabilities of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being “Senior Unsecured Notes
Liabilities” and documents creating or evidencing the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, the
“Senior Unsecured Notes Documents”) that may be incurred by a special purpose entity which is
wholly-owned directly or indirectly by the Investors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
(other than the Issuer) and is neither a member of the Group nor a subsidiary of the Issuer (such
entity, the “Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer”) and provisions relating to the liabilities in respect of
guarantees granted by each guarantor of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured
Notes Guarantee Liabilities”), that is permitted or not prohibited under the Credit Facility
Documents, the Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior
Unsecured Note Document to rank equally with any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the creditors in respect of such indebtedness
being the “Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide for any credit facility constituting a “Credit
Facility” under the Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the
Notes Documents, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured
Notes Document to receive priority in respect of the proceeds of the enforcement against the
Collateral (each such facility being a “Credit Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit
Facility, the “Credit Facilities” and each finance document relating thereto (but excluding any
Hedging Agreement), a “Credit Facility Document”). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a
“Credit Facility Lender” and excluding any Hedging Liabilities, the liabilities of the Debtors to the
Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the “Credit Facility Lender Liabilities.”

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict
between the terms of a Debt Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.

By purchasing a Note, Noteholders shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Notes Trustee and
the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.

132


-----

The following description is a summary of certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted
payments described below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities; (ii) the liabilities of the
Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into in relation to interest rate hedging in
respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or any Senior Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari
Passu Debt (the “Super Senior Hedging Liabilities” and, together with the Credit Facility Lender
Liabilities and the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the Credit Facility Agent, the
“Super Senior Liabilities” and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities, the “Super Senior
Creditors”); (iii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Hedging Agreements entered into in
relation to foreign currency hedging in respect of (1) any Credit Facility, the Notes or the Senior
Unsecured Notes or (2) in respect of Pari Passu Debt (the “Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities”
and the creditors of the Non-Super Hedging Liabilities, the “Non-Super Senior Hedge
Counterparties”); (iv) the liabilities of the Issuer and the Debtors in respect of the Notes (the
“Notes Liabilities”); (v) the Pari Passu Liabilities (together with the Notes Liabilities and the NonSuper Senior Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Liabilities”, and the creditors of the Senior
Secured Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditors”); (vi) the liabilities of the Issuer and the
Debtors in respect of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities”) and
(vii) certain other unsecured liabilities, will rank in right and priority of payment in the following
order:

  - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities of any Debtor to an arranger under the
Revolving Credit Facility (the “Arranger Liabilities”), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the
liabilities of the Security Agent (the “Security Agent Liabilities”) will rank pari passu and
without any preference between them;

  - second, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities will rank pari passu and without
any preference between them.

The intercompany obligations (the “Intra Group Liabilities” and the documents creating or
evidencing such Intra Group Liabilities being “Intra Group Debt Documents”) of any member of
the Group to any other member of the Group (each an “Intra Group Lender” and collectively the
“Intra Group Lenders”) are postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to
the Primary Creditors. The liabilities owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of
the Issuer (or any holding company or subsidiary of the Issuer or any other subsidiary of any such
holding company that is not a member of the Group) and any of their respective transferees or
successors (the “Shareholder Liabilities” and the documents creating or evidencing such
Shareholder Liabilities being “Shareholder Debt Documents”) are postponed and subordinated
to the Liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors.

In this section the Shareholder Liabilities and the Intra Group Liabilities are together referred to
as the “Subordinated Liabilities.”

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the
Transaction Security ranks and secures the following liabilities in the following order:

  - first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities
will rank and secure such liabilities first, pari passu and without any preference between
them; and

  - second (to the extent only of any SUN Shared Security (as defined below), the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities.

The Senior Unsecured Liabilities and the Subordinated Liabilities will not be secured by any of the
Transaction Security unless permitted by the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents and
any Pari Passu Debt Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Unsecured Notes
Liabilities shall be secured by the SUN Shared Security if any (being the security granted in favor
of the Security Agent over the shares, loans, bonds or other equity or debt instruments issued by
the Issuer to the Parent Guarantor or any holding company of the relevant Subordinated Notes
Issuer which is a holding company of the Parent Guarantor). The Senior Unsecured Notes
Liabilities are senior obligations of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer. Until the Senior Secured
Debt Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors may not take any steps to

133


-----

appropriate the assets of the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer in connection with any enforcement
action other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all Proceeds from Enforcement of the Collateral and certain
other recoveries will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds from enforcement
_of Transaction Security.”_

**_Further security and incremental borrowings_**

The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities (the
Super Senior Liabilities, the liabilities owed to Creditor Representatives (as defined herein, other
than in paragraph (f) of that definition), the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Arranger
Liabilities, together, the “Secured Liabilities,” and the creditors thereof, the “Secured Parties”
and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the “Secured Debt Documents”) may take,
accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities or
other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities,
provided that, if and to the extent legally possible, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is also granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other
Secured Parties. Any such additional security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above and the proceeds of the
enforcement of any such security will be applied as provided under “—Application of proceeds
_from enforcement of Transaction Security.”_

The Intercreditor Agreement will contemplate the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring
incremental borrowing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing the
borrowing liabilities incurred under the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or
in respect of any Credit Facility, the Notes, the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities,
the Pari Passu Debt or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments together with
Transaction Security Documents, the Shareholder Debt Documents and the Intra Group Debt
Documents being referred to collectively as the “Debt Documents”) and/or incurring guarantee
liabilities in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with any such refinancing (such
incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred
to as “Additional Indebtedness”) which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with
and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank
behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing
liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the
“Subordinated Creditors” and, collectively with the Secured Parties and the Senior Unsecured
Notes Creditors, the “Creditors” and each a “Creditor”) will confirm in the Intercreditor
Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is
permitted or not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, they will (at the Debtors’
cost) enter into such documentation as may be necessary (including entering into a new
intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to
ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the Debtors in
respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it
in accordance with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does
not in any significant respect have a material adverse effect on the interests of any of the
Secured Parties.

**_Security: Pari Passu Creditors_**

The Pari Passu Creditors may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) security in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities in addition to the Transaction Security if,
at the same time, it is also granted either:

(i) to the Security Agent as trustee for the other Secured Parties in respect of their
secured obligations;

134


-----

(ii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in
favor of the Security Agent as trustee for the Secured Parties:

A. to the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations; or

B. to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure for the benefit of the
other Secured Parties; or

(iii) in the case of any security granted after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement,
to some of the Secured Parties provided that such security is incremental to the
Transaction Security that has already been granted in favor of all other Secured
Parties and any proceeds derived from the enforcement of such security will be
shared with the Secured Parties in accordance with the payment waterfalls set
forth in “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security.”

and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority”; and

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the Pari Passu
Liabilities in addition to those in:

(i) the original form of the Pari Passu Debt Documents;

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given for the benefit of
all the Secured Parties in respect of their Secured Liabilities;

only if, in each case (1) the grant of such security or the giving of such guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss is permitted by the documents or instruments creating or evidencing
the Notes Liabilities (the “Notes Documents”) and the Credit Facility Documents and (2) at the
same time, it is also granted to the Credit Facility Lenders and granted to the other Secured
Parties in respect of their respective Secured Liabilities and ranks in the same order of priority as
that contemplated in “—Ranking and priority.”

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will permit, prior to the occurrence of an acceleration event in
respect of a Credit Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Notes Liabilities (a “Secured Debt
Acceleration Event”), payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Notes Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Credit Facility Agreement, Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents,
but subject to: (i) in the case of payments in respect of the Notes, compliance with the Notes
Purchase condition described under “—Revolving Credit Facility—Notes purchase condition”;
(ii) in the case of payments in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities, any restrictions under the Credit
Facilities, the Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents then outstanding. Following
the occurrence of a Secured Debt Acceleration Event, subject to certain exceptions, payments can
only be made by the Debtors applying the amounts received by the relevant Debtor under the
process described under “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security.”
The restriction in the foregoing sentence shall not apply (i) where, provided that the Majority
Super Senior Creditors constitute the Instructing Group in accordance with “—Enforcement
_decision,” a payment block suspension notice has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent to_
the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) to the
extent that such Secured Debt Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or
irrevocably revoked in writing by each relevant Creditor Representative.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments in respect of Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantee Liabilities prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date (as defined below) to be made by
the Debtors under the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents including if (a) (i) the payment is of
any principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer Liabilities which is either not prohibited from being paid by the Credit Facility, the Notes
Document and any Pari Passu Debt Document or is paid on or after the final maturity date of the
Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is a date not earlier than one
year after the originally scheduled maturity date of the Notes and Termination Date (as defined
in the Credit Facility Documents) at the time of issuance of such Senior Unsecured Notes or is a
payment of any amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest or a

135


-----

corresponding amount under the relevant proceeds loans for the Senior Unsecured Notes (such
amount including all scheduled interest payments, including if applicable, special interest or
liquidated damages) and default interest on the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities accrued due
and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Debt Document, additional
amounts payable as a result of the tax gross up provisions relating to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in the relevant indenture for the Senior
Unsecured Notes and/or applicable proceeds loan, (ii) no notice of a Secured Debt Event of
Default has been delivered by the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt
Representative (as the case may be); and (iii) no payment default under any Credit Facility, the
Notes Indenture (above an agreed threshold) and the Pari Passu Liabilities Documents (above an
agreed threshold) has occurred and is continuing; (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as
defined below) and the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative give prior consent
to that payment being made; (c) the payment is of amounts owing to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee (the “Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts”); (d) the payment is of administrative
and maintenance costs, fees, expenses and taxes of the Issuer (in acting as the issuer of the Senior

of the Credit Facilities; or (e) the payment is of costs, commissions, taxes, premiums and any
expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) any refinancing of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit
Facilities, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also permit payments to be made from time to time when due
to lenders owed any Intra Group Liabilities (“Intra Group Liabilities Payments”) if at the time of
payment no Secured Debt Acceleration Event or an acceleration event in respect of the Senior
Unsecured Notes Liabilities has occurred and is continuing (an “Acceleration Event”). The
Intercreditor Agreement will permit Intra Group Liabilities Payments if (i) an Acceleration Event
has occurred prior to the date on which the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged in full (the
“Super Senior Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Instructing Group (as defined, and
further described, in “—Enforcement decision”); (ii) an Acceleration Event has occurred after the
Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior Secured Liabilities are
discharged in full (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders (as defined below) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iii) an
Acceleration Event has occurred after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the later of
the date on which the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities are discharged (the “Senior Unsecured
Notes Discharge Date”), with the consent of the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (as
defined herein) (acting through their Creditor Representatives); (iv) that payment is made to
facilitate payment of the Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities; or (v) to the extent
a Secured Debt Acceleration Event has subsequently been cancelled and/or irrevocably revoked in
writing by each relevant Creditor Representative, the payment is made to facilitate payments of
the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities that are permitted to be paid under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and, if such payment is made pursuant to Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantees or Additional Senior Unsecured Guarantees, it would be permitted at such time.

Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment
is not prohibited by a Credit Facility, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents or the
Senior Unsecured Notes Documents; (ii) the payment is to be made to the Senior Unsecured Notes
Issuer in respect of any Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer Liabilities made in order to make a
corresponding payment in Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities which is then due and payable by
the Senior Unsecured Issuer pursuant to the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents (or in the case of
a payment in respect of scheduled interest, such payment will become due and payable within
three business days) to be made at the time such payment of Shareholder Liabilities is made to
the Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer; (iii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Instructing
Group (as defined below) gives written consent to such payment being made; (iv) on or after the
Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written
consent to such payment being made; or (v) after the Secured Debt Discharge Date but prior to
Senior Unsecured Discharge Date, the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders (acting through
their Creditor Representative (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment being
made. At any time prior to an Acceleration Event, Shareholder Liabilities may be converted into
equity.

Documents and which would have been permitted payments but for that Senior
Unsecured Payment Stop Notice or Secured Debt Payment Default, then any Event of
Default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be
waived and any Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice (as defined below) which may
have been issued as a result of that event of default shall be waived, in each case
without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Unsecured
Noteholders.

_Restrictions on enforcement/certain challenges by Senior Unsecured Noteholders_

Until the later of the Secured Debt Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as
required by the Instructing Group, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder shall take or require the
taking of any enforcement action in relation to the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities except as
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes
_Guarantee enforcement” below:_

_Permitted Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement_

(a) The above restrictions on enforcement will not apply if:

(i) an event of default (or event or circumstance which would, with the expiration
of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination
provided for in the relevant definition of “Event of Default” in the Senior
Unsecured Notes Indenture or any combination of the foregoing, be an event of
default) under any Senior Unsecured Notes Indenture (a “Senior Unsecured Notes
Default”) (such default being a “Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default”) is
continuing;

138


-----

(ii) the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) have received a notice of the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes
Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior
Unsecured Notes Default from the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee;

(iii) a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default is continuing at the end of the
relevant Senior Unsecured Standstill Period.

(b) Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Unsecured Notes Default, the Senior
Unsecured Notes Trustee may, by notice (a “Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice”) in
writing notify the Credit Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt
Representative(s) of the existence of such Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

**_Senior Unsecured Standstill Period_**

In relation to a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default, a Senior Unsecured Standstill Period
shall mean the period beginning on the date (the “Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date”) the
Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee serves a Senior Unsecured Enforcement Notice on the Credit
Facility Agent, the Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative(s) in respect of such
Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Unsecured Standstill Start Date (the “Senior
Unsecured Standstill Period”);

(b) the date the Secured Parties take any enforcement action (excluding any action taken
to preserve or perfect any Collateral as opposed to realize it) in relation to a
Guarantor, provided that the Senior Unsecured Noteholders and Additional Senior
Unsecured Creditors may then only take the same enforcement action in relation to
the Guarantor as the enforcement action taken by the Secured Parties against such
Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an insolvency event in relation to a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor
against whom enforcement action is to be taken;

(d) the date on which a Senior Unsecured Notes Default occurs for failure to pay principal
at the original scheduled maturity of the Senior Unsecured Notes; and

(e) the expiration of any other Senior Unsecured Standstill Period outstanding at the date
such first Senior Unsecured Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiration occurs
as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy).

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders may take enforcement action as described above in relation to
a Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Unsecured
Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior Unsecured Standstill Period has begun as a
result of any other Relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Default.

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee that it is enforcing
Transaction Security created over (directly or indirectly) shares of a Senior Unsecured Notes
Guarantor, no Senior Unsecured Noteholder may take any action referred to in “—Permitted
_Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee enforcement,” above against that Senior Unsecured Notes_
Guarantor while the Security Agent is, in accordance with the instructions of the Instructing
Group, taking steps to enforce that Collateral where such action might be reasonably likely to
adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Enforcement Instructions_**

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other
enforcement action unless otherwise instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as further
described in “—Enforcement decision”).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Instructing Group may give instructions
to the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Transaction Security as they see fit provided
that the instructions as to enforcement given by the Instructing Group are consistent with the
Security Enforcement Principles (as defined below).

139


-----

**_Enforcement decision_**

If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting
through their Creditor Representatives) (the “Instructing Group”) wish to instruct the Security
Agent to commence enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must
deliver a copy of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the “Proposed Enforcement
Instructions”) to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representative for each of the Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate). The Security Agent shall promptly
notify each Creditor Representative of the Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Trustee and each of
the Pari Passu Representatives upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement Instructions.

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received any Proposed
Enforcement Instructions, then the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing
the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions of the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders (and the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders shall be the Instructing Group for the
purpose of “—Enforcement instructions,” in each case, acting through their respective Creditor
Representative) provided that such instructions are consistent with certain Security Enforcement
Principles (as referred to below) and failure to give instructions will be deemed to be an
instruction not to take Enforcement steps.

In the event that:

(a) from the date that is three months after the date upon which the first Proposed
Enforcement Instructions (including such instructions not to take Enforcement steps)
are delivered, the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders have not taken any Enforcement
Action of the Transaction Security; or

(b) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of
the date upon which the first such Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including any
such instructions not to take Enforcement steps) are delivered,

then (with effect from the date of the earlier to occur of such events), the Majority Super Senior
Creditors shall become the Instructing Group for the purposes of “—Enforcement instructions.”

If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the
Transaction Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become enforceable in
accordance with its terms, a Creditor Representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, as the case may be, may at any time
provide immediate instructions as to Enforcement to the Security Agent. If the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith (and notify the
Creditor Representatives of the other Super Senior Creditors and the Notes Creditors and the Pari
Passu Creditors and the Security Agent) the delay in taking Enforcement Action of the
Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

and the Security Agent shall act with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of
the determination pursuant to (i) or (ii) above, in accordance with the first such notice of
determination and instructions as to Enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in
each case that such instructions are consistent with certain Security Enforcement Principles
(referred to below).

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor or Security Provider
(other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security
Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu
Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors
have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from such Majority
Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received Proposed
Enforcement Instructions from the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required
Holders and has commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the
Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the Creditor
Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as the Creditor

140


-----

Representative for the Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement instructions to the
Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supercede any such prior instructions
given by the Creditor Representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders.

Other than where the preceding two paragraphs apply, if, prior to the Super Senior Discharge
Date, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case,
acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a
manner which is not consistent with certain Security Enforcement Principles (as referred to
below), the Creditor Representatives for the relevant Super Senior Creditors or Senior Secured
Creditors shall give notice to the Creditor Representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors
and Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate), after which the Creditor Representatives for the
other Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Trustee and each Pari Passu Debt Representative shall
consult with the Security Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant
Creditor Representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement
provided that such Creditors’ Representatives shall not be obligated to consult in the manner
referred to in this paragraph more than once in relation to each enforcement action.

After the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided by the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders.

**_Limitation on enforcement of Shareholder Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement
action in respect of such liabilities prior to the last to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date,
the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Senior Unsecured Notes Discharge Date (the “Final
Discharge Date”) save that, prior to the Final Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to any Debtor or member of the Group or grantor of Transaction
Security, each such Creditor may only (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless
the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that
Creditor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), and shall, if so directed by
the Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the Group
to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group’s Shareholder Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that member of the Group in respect of any Shareholder Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any
Shareholder Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Shareholder
Liabilities owing to it,

but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Limitation on enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement
action in respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date except that, prior to the Final
Discharge Date and after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the
Group or grantor of Transaction Security, each Intra Group Lender may only (unless otherwise
directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given notice that it
intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra Group Lender in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the Security Agent, exercise any right it may otherwise
have against that member of the Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that Group member’s Intra Group Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that member of the Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities;

141


-----

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra
Group Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the
Intra Group Liabilities owing to it,

but shall not take any other enforcement action.

**_Security Enforcement Principles_**

A Creditor Representative may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with the
following security enforcement principles (the “Security Enforcement Principles”):

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction
Security to achieve the security enforcement objective, such objective being to
maximise the recovery by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors
so far as such recovery is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of value
from enforcement of the Transaction Security (the “Security Enforcement Objective”);

(b) without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will
be enforced and other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as
further described in “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction
_Security”); or_

(ii) in the case of enforcement by the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders sufficient
Proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to
ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of
_Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in_
full in cash (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(c) to the extent that the Transaction Security that is the subject of the proposed
enforcement action is:

(i) securing assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate
book value of such assets exceeds EUR 1 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii) over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

then the Security Agent shall, if requested by the Instructing Group, and at the
expense of the Issuer, (to the extent that financial advisors have not adopted a general
policy of not providing such opinion) appoint an internationally recognized
investment bank or accountancy firm or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent
to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially reasonable terms (including for
reasons of conflicts of interest) as determined by the Security Agent (acting in good
faith), another third-party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing
valuations in respect of the relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm
appointed as the relevant Debtor’s administrator or other relevant officer holder)
selected by the Security Agent (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert that the
consideration received from any disposal is fair from a financial point of view after
taking into account all relevant circumstances (a “Financial Advisor’s Opinion”);

(d) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to
seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the
Intercreditor Agreement. Prior to making any appointment of a Financial Advisor, the
Security Agent is entitled to ensure that cost cover (at a level it is satisfied with acting
reasonably) has been provided;

(e) the Financial Advisor’s Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such
action is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant
circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has
been met;

142


-----

(f) where the Instructing Group is the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor’s Opinion
where sufficient Proceeds from Enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in
cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of
_Transaction Security”), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full;_
and

(g) in the event that an enforcement of the Transaction Security is conducted by way of
Public Auction (as defined below), no Financial Advisor shall be required to be
appointed, and no Financial Advisor’s Opinion shall be required, in relation to such
enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
appoint a Financial Advisor to provide such advice as the Security Agent deems
appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of Public Auction.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders and the
Security Agent.

“Public Auction” means an auction or other competitive sale process of assets, by or on behalf of
the Security Agent pursuant to an enforcement of Transaction Security (or by a member of the
Group in circumstances that are a Distressed Disposal (as defined below)), the process of such sale
or disposal having been conducted as follows:

(a) prior to the sale or other disposal, the Security Agent shall, in respect of such auction
or other competitive sale process, consult with an internationally recognized
investment bank or accounting firm selected by the Security Agent (acting reasonably)
with respect to the procedures which may reasonably be expected to be used to
obtain a fair market price in the then prevailing market conditions (taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in order to facilitate a prompt and expeditious
sale at a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions although there shall be
no obligation to postpone any such sale in order to achieve a higher price);

(b) the Security Agent shall have implemented (to the extent permitted by law) in all
material respects the procedures recommended by such bank or firm in relation to
such auction or process;

(c) the Secured Parties shall have a right to participate; and

(d) Holdco shall not have the right to participate without the consent of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties), the Senior Secured Notes
Required Holders and the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders of each tranche of Pari
Passu Debt if such auction or competitive sale process is in respect of SUN Shared
Security or assets which were secured by such SUN Shared Security before foreclosure
thereof.

For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) above:

(i) the Security Agent shall be entitled to retain any such internationally recognized
investment bank or accounting firm as its and/or any of the other Secured
Parties’ financial advisor to advise and assist in the proposed sale or disposition
for such remuneration as the Security Agent in good faith determines is
appropriate for the circumstances;

(ii) except as required by applicable law, the Security Agent shall not have any
obligation to any person to engage in or to use reasonable efforts to engage in a
listing of any or all of any equity interests the subject of such auction or other
competitive sale process, including, without limitation, if recommended by such
investment bank or accounting firm;

143


-----

(iii) by reason of certain prohibitions, or exemptive or safe-harbor provisions from
such prohibitions, contained in law or regulations of any applicable
governmental authority, the Security Agent may, with respect to any sale of all
or any part of such equity interests or assets:

A. limit purchasers to those who meet the requirements of such governmental
authority or exemptive or safe-harbor provision (as applicable) and/or make
representations and undertakings satisfactory to the Security Agent relating
to compliance with such requirements and/or provisions; and/or

B. limit purchasers to persons who will agree, among other things to acquire
such shares for their own account, for investment and not with a view to
the distribution or resale thereof;

(iv) the Security Agent and other Secured Parties shall not under any circumstances
be required to make representations, warranties or undertakings to any actual or
proposed purchaser (other than customary representations in a security
enforcement as to power to transfer the relevant equity interests pursuant to the
Transaction Security Documents) or to indemnify any actual or proposed
purchaser against any costs, liabilities or similar expenses or losses; and

(v) without limitation to the other circumstances of the sale or other disposition that
the Security Agent and such investment bank or accounting firm may take into
consideration, the Security Agent may (but is not required to) in all circumstances
specify that no offer to purchase equity interest or other assets will be
entertained unless such offer:

A. is for all (and not some only) of the equity interests being sold or otherwise
disposed;

B. is for cash consideration payable at closing (and therefore not including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any element of deferred compensation) and is not
subject to any financing conditions; and/or

C. contemplates a closing of the sale of the equity interests or other assets in
not more than three (3) months (or such longer period as the Security
Agent may specify) from the time of initiation of the sale or disposition
process; and

(vi) a “right to participate”:

A. means any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a Secured Party
makes shall be considered by the Security Agent or such investment bank or
accounting firm against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a
potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder. For the avoidance
of doubt, if after having applied that same criteria, the offer or indication
of a potential offer made by a Secured Party is not considered by the
Security Agent or such investment bank or accounting firm to be sufficient
to continue in the sale or disposal process, such consideration being against
the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any
other bidder or potential bidder (such continuation may include being
invited to review additional information or being invited to have an
opportunity to make a subsequent or revised offer, whether in another
round of bidding or otherwise) then the right to participate of that Secured
Party under this Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied; and

B. shall not apply if the Security Agent believes in good faith that it may (or
there is a risk that it may) result in a violation of any applicable laws or that
it may (or there is a risk that it may) result in a requirement for registration
under any applicable securities laws.

For the purposes of paragraph (a), such investment bank or accounting firm may be instructed by
the Security Agent to take the limitations set out in subparagraphs (i) to (vi) (inclusive) above
into account and to formulate recommendations that are consistent with them.

144


-----

**_Exercise of voting rights_**

Each Creditor (other than the Credit Facility Lenders, the Revolving Credit Facility Agent, the
Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee) will
cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or
supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar
proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent and the
Security Agent shall give instructions for these purposes as directed by the Instructing Group,
provided that such instructions have been given in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Turnover_**

_Turnover by Primary Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any creditor in respect of the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities or the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities (the “Primary
Creditors”) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Transaction Security
(whether before or after an insolvency event) other than in accordance with the payment
waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security,”
that Primary Creditor will, subject to certain exceptions:

(a) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off, (i) hold
that amount on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which
receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such creditor to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(b) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly
pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Turnover by Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors and Subordinated Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or any
creditor of any Subordinated Liabilities receives or recovers:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of, or in relation to any such liabilities
which is not otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or made in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds from
_enforcement of Transaction Security”;_

(b) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
amount by way of set-off in respect of any such liabilities which is not otherwise
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or which does not give effect to a
payment or enforcement action which is otherwise permitted to be made, received or
taken by the relevant creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
amount on account of, or in relation to, any of such liabilities after the occurrence of
an Secured Debt Acceleration Event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a
“Distress Event”) or as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor
or a member of the Group (other than after the occurrence of an insolvency event in
respect of that Debtor or that member of the Group), other than, in each case, any
amount received or recovered in accordance with the payment waterfall described in
“—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security”;

(d) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
amount by way of set-off in respect of any of such liabilities after the occurrence of a
Distress Event; or

(e) other than by way of set-off permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of
such liabilities which is not made in accordance with the payment waterfall described

145


-----

in “—Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that
Debtor.

The relevant Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor or Subordinated Creditor (as applicable) will,
subject to certain exceptions:

(i) in relation to receipts or recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off,
hold that amount on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount
to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the

(if any) by which receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities owed to such
creditor to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that amounts received from the realization or
enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security will be applied in the following order
of priority:

(a) _first, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment of: (A) any sums owing to the_
Security Agent or any delegate appointed by the Security Agent or any receiver, any
Pari Passu Debt Representative in respect of any Pari Passu Debt issued in the form of
notes, any amounts owing to the Notes Trustee, any Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee

such obligations);

(b) _second, pari passu and pro rata in or toward payment of all costs and expenses_

Agent;

(c) _third, pari passu and pro rata in or toward payment to: (i) the Revolving Credit Facility_

of SUN Shared Security, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee or proceeds from a
Distressed Disposal in relation to assets which were previously secured by such SUN
Shared Security, in payment or distribution to each Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee on
behalf of the Senior Unsecured Noteholders or, if there is no Senior Unsecured Notes
Trustee acting on behalf of any relevant Senior Unsecured Noteholders, such Senior
Unsecured Noteholders for application towards the discharge of the Senior Unsecured
Notes Liabilities owed to the Senior Unsecured Noteholders (in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes Documents); and

the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the Security Providers, any member
of the Group or any other party entitled to receive it.

**_Release of the Guarantees and the Security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposal_

In circumstances where a disposal of an asset of the Group which is subject to the Transaction
Security is not being effected (a) by enforcement of the Transaction Security; (b) at the request of
the Instructing Group, after the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (c) in the case of
a disposal to a person or persons outside the Group, after a Secured Debt Acceleration Event or a
Distress Event has occurred (each a “Distressed Disposal”) and is otherwise permitted by the
Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Senior
Unsecured Notes Documents (together the “Senior Debt Documents,” and such disposal, a “NonDistressed Disposal”), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent is
authorized (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document
over the relevant asset; and (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor,
to release the Transaction Security or any other claim relating to a Debt Document over the
assets of that Debtor and the shares in and assets of any of its subsidiaries, provided that if an
asset which is the subject of a Non- Distressed Disposal is transferred to another member of the
Group the release of the Transaction Security must be permitted under the terms of the Credit
Facilities, the Notes Documents and any Pari Passu Debt Documents and, to the extent that
replacement Transaction Security is required from the transferee under the terms of the Debt
Documents, such Transaction Security will (subject to any other requirements relating to the
release, retaking, amendment or extension of the Transaction Security under the Debt
Documents) be granted at the same time as (or before) the relevant disposals are effected.

If any proceeds from a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied in mandatory
prepayment of any of the Secured Liabilities or to be offered to any Secured Party pursuant to
the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, then such proceeds will be applied in or towards
payment of such Secured Liabilities or shall be offered to the relevant Secured Parties in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Secured Debt Documents and the consent of any other
party will not be required for that application.

_Distressed Disposal_

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that the Security Agent is authorized: (a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares
in the capital of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets of that Debtor or
any subsidiary of that Debtor; (ii) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any
part of its borrowing liabilities in respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities
owed by the Issuer to the Primary Creditors), its liabilities as guarantor in respect of the Debt
Documents and any trading or other liabilities it may have to an Intra Group Lender or another
Debtor (“Other Liabilities”); and (iii) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor or another
Debtor over the relevant assets; and (b) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the
capital of a holding company of a Debtor, to release: (i) the Transaction Security over the assets
of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company; (ii) that holding company

respect of the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to the

147


-----

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the Security Agent is authorized:

(a) if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or a holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities of
that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company
under the Debt Documents (other than borrowing liabilities owed by the Issuer to a
Primary Creditor) or any liabilities owed by such Debtor, holding company or
subsidiary to another Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”):

(i) if the Security Agent does not intend that the relevant transferee will be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such
liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor or all (but not part) of such Debtor
Liabilities; or

(ii) if the Security Agent does intend that the relevant transferee will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all (but not part) of such
liabilities owed to a Primary Creditor and all or any part of such Debtor Liabilities
and any other liabilities under the Debt Documents,

on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors.

Where a Distressed Disposal of an asset is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will also
provide that the Security Agent is authorized, if the asset being disposed of consists of shares in the
capital of a Debtor or a holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security
Agent decides to transfer to another Debtor all or any part of that Disposed Entity’s obligations (or
any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity) in respect of Intra Group Liabilities or
Debtor Liabilities, to enter into any agreement to agree the transfer and acceptance of all or part
of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the
Debtors which owe such liabilities and the Debtors to which such liabilities are to be transferred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have an
obligation to postpone any Distressed Disposal in order to achieve a higher price).

If on or after the first date on which Senior Unsecured Notes are issued but before the Senior
Unsecured Notes Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Senior
Unsecured Notes Guarantees will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee has approved the release on the instructions of
the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(ii) all present and future obligations owed to the Secured Parties under the Credit
Facility Documents, Hedging Agreements, the Notes Documents and the Pari
Passu Debt Documents by a member of the Group, all of whose shares are
pledged or charged in favor of the Secured Parties are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such enforcement action, are unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not
assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all or part security under
the Transaction Security Documents in respect of the assets that are sold or
disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of
any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

A. the Credit Facility Agent, Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative
determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the finance parties
under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Note Creditors and the Pari Passu
Creditors (respectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged; and

148


-----

B. the Credit Facility Agent, Notes Trustee and Pari Passu Debt Representative
serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the
same, in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell
and transfer such claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser);
and

(iii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

A. pursuant to a Public Auction; or

B. where a Financial Advisor confirms that the sale, disposal or transfer price is
fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant
circumstances, although there shall be no obligation to postpone any such
sale, disposal or transfer in order to achieve a higher price.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities
owed to a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the payment waterfall described in “—Application of proceeds
_from enforcement of Transaction Security,” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an_
enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities owed to
a Primary Creditor or disposal of Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or
Debtor Liabilities had not occurred.

In this section:

amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the
then outstanding relevant tranche of Pari Passu Debt, in accordance with the relevant Pari Passu
Debt Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the Pari Passu Creditors of
the required principal amount of relevant tranche of Pari Passu Debt have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, relevant Pari Passu Debt owned by any Debtor, or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with

-----

principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, in accordance with the Notes Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, in determining whether the Noteholders of the required principal amount
of Notes have concurred in any direction, approval, consent or waiver, Notes owned by any
Debtor, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or
indirect common control with any Debtor other than an Independent Debt Fund, will be

Notes Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, approval, waiver or consent,
only Notes that the Notes Trustee knows are so owned will be disregarded;

“Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantees” means each senior subordinated guarantee by a Senior

are so owned will be disregarded.

**_Amendment_**

In addition to customary minor, technical or administrative matter amendments by the Security
Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it may be amended with only the consent
of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required
Holders, the Senior Unsecured Notes Required Holders, the Issuer and the Security Agent, unless
it is an amendment, waiver or consent that has the effect of changing or which relates to: (a) any
amendment to the order of priority or subordination set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement;
(b) any amendment to the payment waterfall, turnover provisions or enforcement provisions set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) certain provisions relating to the giving of instructions

150


-----

(viii) the Security Agent.

If, however, an amendment, waiver or consent affects only one class of Secured Party and could
not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the interests of the other classes of
Secured Party, only agreement from the requisite affected class is required.

Subject to the paragraphs above and certain other exceptions, no amendment or waiver of the
Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the
rights of any party to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior written consent of the
affected party.

**_Option to purchase: Notes Creditors and Pari Passu Creditors_**

After a Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ prior written notice to the Revolving
Credit Facility Agent and, if applicable, the Hedge Counterparties, the Notes Trustee and the Pari
Passu Creditor Representative, at the direction and expense of and having obtained all necessary
approvals from the Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditors (as applicable) (the “Purchasing Senior
Secured Creditors”), will have the right to acquire or procure that a nominee acquires by way of
transfer all (but not part only) of the rights and obligations of the Credit Facility Lenders and the
Super Senior Hedge Counterparties in respect of Super Senior Liabilities and the Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities (the “Super Senior Acquisition Debt”). If more than one Purchasing Senior
Secured Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Super Senior Acquisition Debt,
each such Purchasing Senior Secured Creditor shall acquire the Super Senior Acquisition Debt pro
rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the Notes and its principal
amount outstanding under the Pari Passu Debt Documents (“Senior Secured Credit
Participations”) bears to the aggregate Senior Secured Credit Participations of all the Purchasing
Senior Secured Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms which will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash
of an amount equal to the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities then outstanding and relevant
hedging purchase amount (as determined in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement),
including in respect of any broken funding costs, as well as certain costs and expenses of the
Super Senior Creditors and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties; after the transfer, no Super
Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be under any actual or contingent
liability to any Debtor or any other person under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit Facility
Document or any Hedging Agreement (in relation to Super Senior Hedging Liabilities only) for
which it is not holding cash collateral in an amount and on terms satisfactory to it; the
purchasing holders of Notes and Pari Passu Creditors (other than the Notes Trustee and the Pari
Passu Debt Representative) indemnify each Super Senior Creditor and Super Senior Hedge
Counterparty for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by
such Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge Counterparty; and the relevant transfer shall
be without recourse to, or warranty from, any Super Senior Creditor or Super Senior Hedge
Counterparty, save that each Credit Facility Lender and Super Senior Hedge Counterparty will be
deemed to have given the following representations and warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and
third-party interests (other than any arising under the relevant finance documents or
by operation of law), of all rights and interests under the Revolving Credit Facility
finance documents or the Credit Facility Documents purporting to be transferred by it
by that transfer;

(b) in the case of a Super Senior Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all
Security and third-party interests (other than any arising under the relevant Hedging
Agreements or by operation of law) of all rights and interests under the relevant
Hedging Agreements purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(c) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to
authorize its entry into and making of, that transfer;

(d) the Credit Facility Lenders and Super Senior Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with
the results of any “know your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of
any person that they are required by law to carry out in relation to such a transfer;
and

151


-----

(e) the Senior Unsecured Noteholders have not exercised the purchase rights described in
“—Option to purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders” below or, having exercised
such rights, have failed to complete the acquisition of the Credit Facility Lender
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities under the Hedging Agreements, the Notes Liabilities
and the Pari Passu Liabilities.

**_Option to purchase: Senior Unsecured Noteholders_**

The Senior Unsecured Noteholders (the “Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors”) may,
after a Distress Event, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Credit Facility Agent, the
Notes Trustee and the Pari Passu Debt Representative (together, the “Relevant Representatives”),
require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but not part only) of the
rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquisition Debt”). If more than one Purchasing Senior Unsecured
Notes Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Senior Secured Acquisition Debt,
each such Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditor shall acquire the Senior Secured
Acquisition Debt pro rata, in the proportion that its principal amount outstanding under the
Senior Unsecured Notes and its principal amount outstanding under the Additional Senior
Unsecured Debt Documents (“Senior Unsecured Credit Participations”) bears to the aggregate
Senior Unsecured Credit Participations of all the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes Creditors.

Any such purchase will be on terms which will include, without limitation, payment in full in cash
of an amount equal to the Secured Liabilities then outstanding, including in respect of any broken
funding costs, as well as certain costs and expenses of the creditors in respect of the relevant
Secured Liabilities; after the transfer, no Credit Facility Lender, Hedge Counterparty, Notes Creditor
or Pari Passu Creditor will be under any actual or contingent liability to any Debtor or any other
person under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Credit Facility Document, any Hedging Agreement,
any Notes Finance Document or any Pari Passu Debt Document for which it is not holding cash
collateral in an amount and on terms satisfactory to it; the Purchasing Senior Unsecured Notes
Creditors, other than the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee, (or if required by the Credit Facility
Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Noteholders or Pari Passu Creditors, a third party acceptable to the
Credit Facility Lenders, Hedge Counterparties, Notes Creditors or Pari Passu Creditors), shall provide
on the date of the transfer an indemnity to each Credit Facility Lender and each other finance
party under such Credit Facility Document, Hedge Counterparty, Notes Creditor or Pari Passu
Creditor (each, an “Indemnified Party”) for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back
any amount received by such Indemnified Party; and the relevant transfer shall be without recourse
to, or warranty from, any Primary Creditor, save that each such Primary Creditor will be deemed to
have given the following representations and warranties on the date of the transfer:

(a) in the case of a Credit Facility Lender, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and
third-party interests (other than any arising under the Credit Facility Documents or by
operation of law), of all rights and interests under the Credit Facility Documents
purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(b) in the case of a Hedge Counterparty, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and
third-party interests (other than any arising under the Hedging Agreements or by
operation of law) of all rights and interests under the Hedging Agreements purporting
to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(c) in the case of a Notes Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and thirdparty interests (other than any arising under the Notes Documents or by operation of
law), of all rights and interests under the Notes Documents purporting to be
transferred by it by that transfer;

(d) in the case of a Pari Passu Creditor, it is the sole owner, free from all Security and
third-party interests (other than any arising under the relevant Pari Passu Debt
Documents or by operation of law), of all rights and interests under the relevant Pari
Passu Debt Documents purporting to be transferred by it by that transfer;

(e) it has the power to enter into and make, and has taken all necessary action to
authorize its entry into and making of, that transfer; and

152


-----

(f) the transferring Primary Creditors and Hedge Counterparties are satisfied with the
results of any “know your client” or other similar checks relating to the identity of any
person that they or any Representative are required by law to carry out in relation to
such a transfer.

**_Governing Law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

#### Contingent Value Instruments

On April 21, 2009, the Parent Guarantor issued 25,500,000 subordinated contingent value bonds,
with a nominal value of €1 each, in a total principal amount of €25.5 million (the “Contingent
Value Instruments”). The Contingent Value Instruments do not bear interest and will expire on
April 21, 2017.

The Contingent Value Instruments will only be partially payable in the event of a Distribution
Event (as defined below) which results in TowerBrook and Investcorp and their affiliates (the
“Contingent Value Instruments Investors”) having received more than three times their
aggregate investments in the Group between the issue date of the Contingent Value Instruments
and the date of such Distribution Event (such excess amount, the “Excess Net Proceeds”). Such
redemption shall be in an amount equal to a proportion of the Excess Net Proceeds (such
proportion being calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the terms and conditions of the
Contingent Value Instruments) and in any event up to a maximum amount equal to the
outstanding principal amount under the Contingent Value Instruments.

A “Distribution Event” will occur in the event of (i) any distribution by Top DutchCo to the
Investors, (ii) any sale or exchange of their membership interest in Top DutchCo by the Investors
or (iii) any other transaction in respect of their membership interest pursuant to which the
Investors would receive proceeds, in cash or otherwise, out of their membership interests.

If (i) a change of control occurs (but following, as the case may be, redemption of the Contingent
Value Instruments up to the amount resulting thereof), (ii) any insolvency proceedings (or other
similar events) occur with respect to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or Autodistribution S.A. or
(iii) on the maturity date of the Contingent Value Instruments, the outstanding principal amount
of the Contingent Value Instruments is more than zero, then the Contingent Value Instruments
shall be automatically and immediately cancelled and no amounts whatsoever shall be due by the
Parent Guarantor to the holders of the Contingent Value Instruments or to their representative
with respect to the Contingent Value Instruments.

The Contingent Value Instruments and the related terms and conditions are governed by French law.

In connection with the subscription of the Contingent Value Instruments, the holders of the
Contingent Value Instruments have also entered into, on the same day of the issue of the
Contingent Value Instruments, an undertaking agreement setting out, among other thing,
certain restrictions to the transfer of the Contingent Value Instruments. The undertaking
agreement is governed by French law.

The terms of the Contingent Value Instruments do not restrict the issue of the Notes nor their use
to repay the Existing Senior Facilities, the EP Bonds and the Hedge Promissory Note.

Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (in
such capacity, the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include
terms of, or be subject to any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the
Issue Date to (i) prepay in full existing Indebtedness (including in respect of amounts owed to its

indebtedness of the Target, (iv) to pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions and (v), to the extent any proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes,
in each case as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of proceeds.”
Pending completion of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the
offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, deposit an amount of proceeds equal to
€40.0 million of this offering of the Senior Secured Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow

Unless and until the Completion Date occurs, the Issuer will not control the Target or any of its

in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the
Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain _covenants—Limitation_ _on_
_Indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens”). Except as otherwise provided for_
in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional
Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,

155


-----

including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any_
Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are
important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make
payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action,
subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees,
and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of
_certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of_
the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this
description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the
Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the
obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon
request.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not
been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions.

#### General

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be general obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the
obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging
Obligations;

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations, that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the
Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligation;

  - be Guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and, no later than the date falling 60 days after
the Issue Date (such date, the “Additional Guarantor Accession Date”), the Additional
Guarantor;

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligation of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors, including obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries under the
Revolving Credit Facility and to trade creditors;

  - mature on, 2019; and

  - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in
certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-entry,
_delivery and form”)._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority
obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,

156


-----

(ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank
senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Collateral and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be Guaranteed by Holdco. The Senior Secured
Notes will also be Guaranteed by the Additional Guarantor on the Additional Guarantor
Accession Date. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in_
the future.

The Notes Guarantee of Holdco, as of the Issue Date, and of the Additional Guarantor, as of the
Additional Guarantor Accession Date, will:

  - be the general obligation of such Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of such
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Notes Guarantee, including
such Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility;

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligation of such Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Notes Guarantee; and

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligation of such Guarantor,
including the obligations of such Guarantor under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
Hedging Obligations, that is secured by property and assets that do not secure its Notes
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, the Notes Guarantee
of the Additional Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the
amount of the loan(s) of the proceeds of this offering of Senior Secured Notes made to and used
by the Additional Guarantor, which is expected to be between approximately €66 million and
€76 million if the Completion Date occurs or €13.6 million otherwise, as described in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of proceeds.” Other Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees_
_or the Dutch Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors —Risks related_
_to our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and the_
_Netherlands, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the_
_Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of
the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

As of October 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, Holdco and its
consolidated Subsidiaries would have had €251.4 million of third-party borrowings,
€240.0 million of which is represented by the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, there would have
been €20.0 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility.

157


-----

**_Principal and maturity_**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of %
Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on, 2019. The Senior
Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the
Senior Secured Notes will:

  - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

  - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on
, 2014;

  - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on and
immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

  - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Senior Secured Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the
next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in the City of
London. The Issuer will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member
state that will not be obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union
Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting
of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the “Directive”), or any
law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The
initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) in Ireland, and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”) in the City of London. The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services
Limited and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch. The
Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured
Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers
of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Senior Secured
Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. For so long as Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent may instead be published in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

#### Notes Guarantees

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment
obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be Guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the
Guarantors (each, a “Guarantor” and such Guarantee, a “Notes Guarantee”).

158


-----

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be Guaranteed by Holdco (such Note Guarantee,
the “Parent Guarantee”) and, on the Additional Guarantor Accession Date, the Additional
Guarantor. As of and for the twelve months ended October 31, 2013, the Issuer and the
Guarantors (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries and intercompany
receivables and loans) accounted for 46.5% of the consolidated total assets, 18.5% of the
consolidated revenue and 42.3% of the consolidated EBITDA of Holdco.

The Senior Secured Notes will also be Guaranteed by the Additional Guarantor on the Additional
Guarantor Accession Date. In addition, as described below under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees”_ and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, certain
Subsidiaries of the Issuer that Guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain
other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture may also be required under the Indenture to
enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions
or to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively
no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. In particular, the Notes Guarantee of the Additional
Guarantor is expected to be limited in value to an amount not greater than the amount of the
loan(s) of the proceeds of this offering of Senior Secured Notes made to and used by the
Additional Guarantor, which is expected to be between approximately €66 million and
€76 million if the Completion Date occurs or €13.6 million otherwise, as described in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of proceeds.” Other Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor may not be similarly limited. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
_the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees_
_or the Dutch Security Providers may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral” and “Risk factors—Risks related to_
_our indebtedness and the Notes—The insolvency and administrative laws of France and the_
_Netherlands, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the_
_Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the_
_security interests in the Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Issuer
depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes. None of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Senior
Secured Notes on the Issue date. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries,
including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and
minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally
will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than any Guarantors) and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As at and for the twelve months
ended October 31, 2013, the total assets (excluding equity investments in wholly-owned
subsidiaries and intercompany receivables and loans), revenue and EBITDA of the non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries represented 81.5%, 57.7% and 53.5% of the consolidated revenue,
consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total assets of Holdco, respectively, and, after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions, the non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries would have had_
€11.4 million of Indebtedness. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

159


-----

**_Notes Guarantees release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:

  - except in the case of the Parent Guarantee, a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct
sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;

  - except in the case of the Parent Guarantee, the designation in accordance with the
Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

  - legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
_and discharge”;_

  - in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

  - as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

  - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_covenants—Additional Guarantees”; or_

  - with respect to a Guarantor that is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain covenants—
_Merger and consolidation—The Subsidiary Guarantors.”_

Upon any occurrence giving rise to the release of a Notes Guarantee, as specified above, the
Trustee, subject to the receipt of certain documentation, shall take all reasonably necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any additional consent of
the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

#### Transfer and exchange

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form
without interest coupons, as follows:

  - Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global
_Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in_
the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

  - Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with
the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the
Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more
fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and
Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

160


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by
the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging
Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to
furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register
the transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior
Secured Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with
a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled
to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

#### Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries

Immediately after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be
Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain

161


-----

_definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted_
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of
the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

#### Escrow of proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption

Concurrently with the closing of this offering of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the
Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to
which the initial purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent into the Escrow Account an
amount equal to €40.0 million from the gross proceeds of this offering of the Senior Secured
Notes sold on the Issue Date. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and
pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, pursuant to an escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and
the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all
other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments
credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the
“Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that
is on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further investigation or liability, to the
effect that:

  - the Contemplated ACR Acquisition will be consummated on terms described in this
Offering Memorandum under the heading “Summary—Recent _developments—_
_Contemplated ACR Acquisition,” (including on the basis of an enterprise value of the_
Target of between €55 million and €65 million), promptly following release of the
Escrowed Property, except for any changes or other modifications to such terms that will
not, individually or when taken as whole, be materially adverse to the interests of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes;

  - immediately after consummation of the Contemplated ACR Acquisition, the Issuer will
own, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the share capital of the Target; and

  - as of the Completion Date, there is no Default or Event of Default under the heading
“Events of Default” that has occurred and be continuing.

The Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above (the date
of such satisfaction, the “Completion Date”). Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be
reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be paid out in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Contemplated ACR Acquisition will not be
consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) any Acquisition Agreement is terminated at any
time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) the Contemplated ACR Acquisition is completed with
cash provided by proceeds from an equity contribution or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
made available by one or more Initial Investors in lieu of using the Escrowed Property, (e) the
Initial Investors cease to beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding
Capital Stock of the Issuer or (f) a Default or Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” below on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will
redeem €40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100%_
of the aggregate issue price of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and
will provide that the Senior Secured Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the
fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory

162


-----

Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes and,
concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to
the Issuer.

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or
the Registrar will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case
of Senior Secured Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-entry, delivery and
_form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Paying_
Agent or the Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph. If any
Definitive Registered Notes is to be redeemed in part only, a new Definitive Registered Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed
in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on
such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date
interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called
for redemption.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer will be required to fund
the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The
_Contemplated ACR Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.”_

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes a security interest over the
Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a
notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for
the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the
Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the
Irish Stock Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant
details relating to such special mandatory redemption.

#### Security

_Date Collateral”)._

163


-----

On the Additional Guarantor Accession Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured, subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, by security interests granted
on an equal and ratable first-ranking basis over (i) the Capital Stock of Commerce Rechange
Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S., Groupement Autodistribution Centre Auvergne “GADCA”
S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by the Additional Guarantor, (ii) the Additional

(collectively, the “Post Issue Date Collateral”).

In addition, if the Completion Date occurs, then within 90 days of the Completion Date the
Senior Secured Notes will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain
perfection requirements, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable first-ranking basis
over all of the issued Capital Stock of the Target (the “Post Completion Date Collateral” and
together with the Issue Date Collateral and the Post Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral relating to rights, property and assets owned by the Dutch Security Providers are
collectively referred to herein as the “Dutchco Security.” The Dutchco Security and the Collateral
relating to the rights, property and assets owned by Holdco are collectively referred to herein as
the “Structural Security.”

The assets that comprise the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property) will also secure on a
first-ranking basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with
the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and
“—Certain covenants—Limitations on Liens,” the Issuer will be permitted to grant security over
the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property) in connection with future issuances of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Senior Secured
Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property) only after certain super
senior priority obligations have been repaid in full, including (i) obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the terms of the Indenture that is
entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on
behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations
that are secured by the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property). Any other security interests
that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any
Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be
subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising
under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
For a brief description of such limitations, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the security interests.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral,
the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Dutch Security Providers, as the case may be, will have the
right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest
and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral,
will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash
dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting
from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions
(whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

As described above, all of the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property) will also secure the
liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility as well as certain Hedging Obligations and any
Additional Senior Secured Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness, certain of

164


-----

which is entitled to payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to
the Notes. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy
the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior
Secured Notes on the Issue Date. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to
be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness
_and the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral (other than the security
interest granted over the Escrowed Property, if any) that are created by the Security Documents
(the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the
Trustee and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture and (d) the creditors of
certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things,
that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the
Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by first-ranking Security Interests; provided,
_however, that the holders of Senior Secured Notes will only receive proceeds from the_
enforcement of the Collateral (other than the security interest granted over the Escrowed
Property, if any) after certain super senior priority obligations have been paid in full, including
(i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with
respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations.
See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition,
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into
after the Issue Date, the Collateral (other than the Escrowed Property, if any) may be pledged to
secure other Indebtedness, including Indebtedness that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior
Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral. See “—Release
_of Liens,” “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain definitions—_
_Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the
Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the
Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including
itself, the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, including France and the Netherlands, due to the laws and other
jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the relevant Security
Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in
favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under law in certain of
these jurisdictions. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The
_security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes.”_

Each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Dutch Security Providers shall, and shall procure that
each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at their own expense, execute and do all such
acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering
any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or
protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the

165


-----

Collateral; and (ii) if such Security Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the
realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or
in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Dutch Security Providers shall, and shall procure that each of their respective Subsidiaries, if any,
shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to
the Security Agent or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the
Security Agent may request.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on
behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such
contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except
through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be
secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that Holdco or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges.
If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Security Documents. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders and the
Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of
the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties
and certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement to rank senior to the Notes. These limitations are described under
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.” The ability to enforce_
may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured
on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each
Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the
Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Senior
Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the
Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and
discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal
or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; agreement to be bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any
further consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of
_certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

166


-----

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting such
Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements
and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter
into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The
_security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes” and_
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**_Release of Liens_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition
does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_sales of assets and Subsidiary stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the_
Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable
(including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets
remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured
Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior
Secured Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge
of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property
and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) with respect to all or part of the Structural Security, only as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “Certain covenants—Maintenance of double Dutchco
_structure”;_

(7) in respect of the Dutchco Security, upon a Change of Control (other than in the
context of an enforcement of the Dutchco Security not involving a release in
accordance with the next paragraph below); or

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described
under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

167


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action requested
by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each
of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such
release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an
Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel each certifying which circumstance, as described
above, giving rise to a release of Liens has occurred, and that such release fully complies with the
indenture.

#### Optional redemption

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for taxation reasons,” the
Senior Secured Notes are not redeemable until, 2016. On and after, 2016 the
Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured Notes upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined
below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the years
indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2016 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

Prior to, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the
original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture (including the
original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount (the “Redemption Amount”) not
exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of %
of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under
the Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Prior to, 2017, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem during each
calendar year up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 103.000% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, prior to, 2016, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the
Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus the Applicable Premium
_plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the_
applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Senior Secured Note the greater of:

(a) 1 % of the principal amount of such Note; and

168


-----

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of such
Senior Secured Note at, 2016 (such redemption price (expressed in
percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the table above under the
first paragraph of this section (excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), plus
(2) all required interest payments due on such Senior Secured Note to and
including, 2016 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon
the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at such
redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Senior Secured Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty
of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of
direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant
maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has
become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior
to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any
publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board of Directors
or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the
redemption date to, 2016; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption
date to, 2016, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal
Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained
by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average
yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given,
except that if the period from such redemption date to, 2016, is less than one year, the
weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany
adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open
market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Senior Secured Notes, it will, for so long as the
Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange so require, inform the Irish Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm
the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the
related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date,
and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Senior Secured Notes (including with the proceeds from an
Equity Offering), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent.

#### No sinking fund

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory
redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

169


-----

#### Redemption at maturity

On, 2019, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

#### Selection and notice

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or
the Registrar will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case
of Senior Secured Notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-entry, delivery and
_form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Paying_
Agent or the Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
Registrar will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily
newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) and in
addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption
date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses
as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may instead
be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates
to that Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed
in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on
such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date
interest will cease to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called
for redemption.

#### Redemption for taxation reasons

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due and which will
become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below)
affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax
_Law”),_

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement

170


-----

cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law
must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such
later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and
(b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the
Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

Any notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication
or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its
right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of internationally recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without
further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.

#### Withholding taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee,
as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law.
If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on
behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is
made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Notes Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable
for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the
existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,

171


-----

nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any
payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure
by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a
reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner,
after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction
would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence
concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting
requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of
the Senior Secured Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the
applicable payment date or the date on which the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on
the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a
payment on the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual
pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced
in order to conform to, such Directive;

(7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment
by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid
such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting
payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(8) any Taxes imposed pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or
otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version
that is substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement
relating thereto; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the
extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The
Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax
receipts are not available, certified copies or other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon
as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

172


-----

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to
the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or
any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in
such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or
future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or
similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, initial
resale, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior Secured
Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after
this Offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture,
any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction
in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such
Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

#### Change of Control

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior
Secured Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such
Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described under this
heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally
exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes
and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and all conditions
to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any
Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior

173


-----

Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date
unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes
or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured
Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased
by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior
Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer,
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of
such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer
in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times)
or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official
website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior
Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to
require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a
transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

174


-----

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in
place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that
constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under
the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control
under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under
such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of
such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not
_have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_
_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture, and_
_the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you_
_protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

In addition, if an event that constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of “Change of
_Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in_
a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a
Change of Control Offer.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described
above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes.

#### Certain covenants

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such
Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro
_forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and (2) to the extent that the
Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio for
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 3.75 to 1.0; provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this
paragraph and clause (11) of the definition of Permitted Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors will not exceed €10.0 million.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following
Indebtedness (“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit
Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or
created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of €30.0 million and 55% of
Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness
permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness
is permitted to be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Liens,”_
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such
Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the
obligee is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and if
the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such
Guarantor exceeds €10.0 million, to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the
reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect
such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness), it is expressly subordinated to the prior
payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Notes Guarantee, in the case of
a Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be
deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not
permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be;

176


-----

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any
Additional Senior Secured Notes) and any “parallel debt” obligations related to
the Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) (i) any Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility or Indebtedness
described in clause (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date;

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in
clauses (4), (5) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant; and

(d) Guarantees of any Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any
acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such
acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition
or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, (x) either (A) the
Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of
Indebtedness and (y) to the extent that the Indebtedness incurred under sub-clause
(ii) of this clause (5) constitutes Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (A) the Issuer
would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Senior Secured Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be greater than
it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and
the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity
Hedging Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings,
Purchase Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing
all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of

otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment
that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of
assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness
which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not
exceed at any time outstanding the greater of €10.0 million and 1.5 % of Total Assets;
_provided that the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or_
improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance
obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment,

indemnification, obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase

connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or
any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by
any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the
purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum
liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness
shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of non-cash
proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
connection with such disposition;

(10) (a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution
of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the

(12) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a Qualified
Receivables Financing;
(13) Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors in an aggregate outstanding principal
amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this

received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary)
of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise
contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case,
subsequent to the Issue Date (excluding the Equity Contributions); provided, however,
that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and
clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary Incurs Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that
are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted

178


-----

Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and clauses (1),
(6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(14) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any CICE
Financing or local working capital facility in an aggregate outstanding principal
amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this
clause (14) and then outstanding, will not exceed €35.0 million; and

(15) Existing ACR Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when
taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal
amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (15) and then
outstanding, will not exceed €5.0 million.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer,
in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(2) (a) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit Facility
shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
this covenant, and may not be reclassified; and

(b) all Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this
covenant that is secured by Liens on the Collateral that is accorded super senior
priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may not be
reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise
included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as
Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the second paragraph
above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case,
any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to
one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount
thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS; and

(8) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of
Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or

179


-----

obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to
be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of
any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference
thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and,
if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or
first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in
clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement
(with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that
is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms;
_provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in_
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being
secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment
ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue
of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose and effect of
the receipt of such proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities was to repay
indebtedness to reduce the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of the Issuer so that there would be an
occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without
the receipt of such proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of
Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence
shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an officer of the Issuer, or,

modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this
clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the

modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset
Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or
other assets subject to such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in
respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180
days of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Issuer’s
consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of
the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet)
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer
nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness and Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if
the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any Guarantee of
such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

188


-----

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the
second paragraph of this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received
from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the
extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the
applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or
such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at
any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €10.0 million and 1.5%
of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this
paragraph (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash
Proceeds of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be
used by the Issuer, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Indebtedness”;_ _provided,_ _however,_ that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the
preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than
the Senior Secured Notes, Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a
_pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes (including Indebtedness with super_
priority status in respect of the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral) at a
price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness
that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other
than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) and at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; provided that the
Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer
to Holders to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions
set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate
principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the Senior Secured
Notes);

(2) purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);

189


-----

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar
Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are
used or useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause
(3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from
the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such
investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that
date,

_provided, however, if the assets disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or_
substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged
as Collateral, the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to
pledge any acquired Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a category of
assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) referred to in this covenant in favor of
the Senior Secured Notes on a first-ranking basis.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €15.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10
Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an
offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any
Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than
the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and
other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount
of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the
purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro
Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured

190


-----

Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes
shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open
for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset_
Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”)
or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of
Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment
by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination
of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal
to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly
issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to
such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note
surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with
a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale,
lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer
(any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €2.5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or
the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of
€10.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been
approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above;
and

191


-----

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of
€20.0 million, the Issuer has received a written opinion (a “Fairness Opinion”) from an
Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial
standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not
materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not
an Affiliate.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments”_ (other than pursuant to clause
(9)(b)(ii) of the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitations on
_Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments_
as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (8), (10), (11) and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock or other securities, or other payments, awards or
grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into,
or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or on
arm’s length term with an entity that is not an Affiliate that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries
or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or
contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant
or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and
(iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement pursuant to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or
permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in
the ordinary course of business; provided, that payments under such Tax Sharing
Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described
under clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax
liabilities of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, in each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of

192


-----

Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on
terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such
time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any
Affiliate (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or an Associate or similar
entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate,
Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Issuer or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that
the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding
are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their
reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with
respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided that such Subordinated Shareholder
Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will be deemed to be Subordinated
Shareholder Funding for all purposes under the indenture;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of annual management,
consulting, monitoring or advisory fees in an aggregate amount not to exceed
€1.25 million per year and related expenses and (b) customary payments by the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly,
including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or
placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in
connection with loans, capital market transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, which
payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause
(11) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) any transactions in respect of which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a
written opinion (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the
Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair
to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on
terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction
at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(and the payment of reasonable out of pocket expenses of the Permitted Holders in
connection therewith) so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer or Holdco announces

auditors of the Issuer or Holdco, a report containing a description of such event,

_provided that the reports required in each of clause (1) and (2) above shall include in such report_
a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial statements of
Holdco and the Issuer for any period after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the
Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior Secured
Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as
the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof and to the extent that the rules and
regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee
will also be made available at the specified office of the listing agent in Dublin, Ireland.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the
date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and
on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such
information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in
the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.
Except as provided below, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or

194


-----

any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any
other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In
addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the
entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s (a) total
revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly
financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day
of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to
the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer or any Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as
it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to
internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the
Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer or Holdco,
as the case may be, is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or
15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
(the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and
the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

195


-----

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Issuer
would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or
(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior
to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Successor Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the terms of the Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or
the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
“Merger and consolidation—The Issuer” covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new
subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_Holdco_

Holdco will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either Holdco is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
(the “Successor Parent Guarantor”) will be a Person organized and existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union, any State of the United States of
America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland and the Successor Parent Guarantor (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of Holdco under its Notes
Guarantee and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of Holdco under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (or
the Successor Parent Guarantor shall have entered into security documents creating
Liens over the relevant Collateral on substantially the same terms as the corresponding
Security Documents then in force), as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the
Successor Parent Guarantor as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by
the Successor Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

196


-----

(3) the Successor Parent Guarantor shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the
terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the
Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on
an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
Holdco, which properties and assets, if held by Holdco instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of Holdco on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of
Holdco.

The Successor Parent Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every
right and power of, Holdco under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially
all its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture
or its Notes Guarantee.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

_The Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, conveyance,
transfer, lease or other disposition) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Subsidiary
Guarantor is the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its
assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor or becomes a Subsidiary
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition;

(b) (1) either (x) a Subsidiary Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantor under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, as applicable (such resulting, surviving or transferee Person,
the “Successor Subsidiary Guarantor”); and (2) immediately after giving effect to
the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of
all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other
than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the
Indenture.

197


-----

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall
not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating
with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to the Issuer, a Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor; (ii) any Subsidiary Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or
part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor; (iii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the
heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1) and
(4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clause (3) under the heading “—The Subsidiary
_Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction._

**_Center of main interests and establishments_**

Prior to a Change of Control, each of the Dutch Security Providers (and any successor Person) will,
for the purposes of The Council of the European Union Regulation No. 1346/2000 on Insolvency
Proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings Regulation”) or otherwise, ensure that its center of
main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) is
situated in its original respective jurisdiction of organization and ensure that it has no
“establishment” (as that term is used in Article 2(b) of the Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) in
any other jurisdiction where to do so could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
interests of the holders of the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Dutch Security
Providers may sell, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of all or substantially all their respective
assets or consolidate with or merge into any person to the extent permitted by clause (5) of the
covenant described under “—Maintenance of Dutchco Structure.”

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, prior to a Change of Control each of the
Dutch Security Providers (and any successor Person) will:

(1) hold all meetings of its board of directors in the Netherlands (or, if a successor Person
is organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg);

(2) keep any share register, official corporate books and account records in the
Netherlands (or, if a successor Person is organized and existing under the laws of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg); and

(3) exercise its administration in the Netherlands (or, if a successor Person is organized
and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg).

**_Maintenance of double Dutchco structure_**

(1) Prior to a Change of Control, Top Dutchco or any successor Person will not sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any voting power of the Capital Stock
and Voting Stock of Dutchco or any successor Person and will not otherwise cease to
own and hold directly all of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of Dutchco or
such successor Person and all of the Capital Stock of Dutchco or such Successor Person
shall constitute Collateral.

(2) Prior to a Change of Control, Dutchco or any successor Person will not sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any voting power of the Capital Stock
and Voting Stock of Holdco or any successor Person and will not otherwise cease to
own and hold directly all of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of Holdco or
such successor Person (other than voting power in respect of directors’ qualifying
shares or shares (or other voting power in the Voting Stock) required by applicable law
to be held by a Person other than Dutchco or such Successor Person), and Dutchco or

198


-----

such Successor Person will ensure that all of the Capital Stock of Holdco or its successor
Person (other than directors’ qualifying shares or shares (or other Capital Stock)
required by applicable law to be held by a Person other than Dutchco or its successor
Person) constitutes Collateral.

(3) Prior to a Change of Control, Holdco or any successor Person will not sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any voting power of the Voting Stock
of the Issuer or any successor Person and will not otherwise cease to own and hold
directly all of the Capital Stock and total voting power of the Voting Stock of the
Issuer or such successor Person (other than voting power in respect of directors’
qualifying shares or shares (or other voting power in the Voting Stock) required by
applicable law to be held by a Person other than Dutchco or such Successor Person),
and Holdco or such Successor Person will ensure that all of the Capital Stock of the
Issuer or any Successor Issuer (other than directors’ qualifying shares or shares (or
other Capital Stock) required by applicable law to be held by a Person other than
Dutchco or its successor Person) constitutes Collateral.

(4) Any requirement for Capital Stock to constitute Collateral in this covenant is a
requirement that such Collateral secures the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes
Guarantees on a senior basis in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Nothing in this covenant shall restrict or prohibit
(i) any Liens created by the Security Documents, any Permitted Liens or Permitted
Collateral Liens or (ii) any release of Liens over the Collateral that may otherwise be
permitted under the Indenture.

(5) Notwithstanding clauses (1)-(3), Top DutchCo and DutchCo may sell, convey, transfer,
lease or dispose of all or substantially all their respective assets or consolidate with or
merge into any Person, so long as:

(a) In the case of Top DutchCo, (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the
“successor Person” of Top Dutchco) will be a Person organized and existing
under the laws of The Netherlands or The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; (2) the
successor Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of Top DutchCo under
the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of Top DutchCo
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents (or the successor Person shall have entered into a security
document creating a Lien over the relevant Collateral on substantially the same
terms as the corresponding Security Document then in force), as applicable; and
(3) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and is continuing; and

(b) In the case of Dutchco, (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“successor Person” of DutchCo) will be a Person organized and existing under the
laws of The Netherlands or The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (and, if organized
and existing under the laws of The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such Person
shall be a société anonyme); (2) the successor Person expressly assumes all of the
obligations of DutchCo under the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental
indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee) and all obligations of DutchCo under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (or the successor
Person shall have entered into a security document creating a Lien over the
relevant Collateral on substantially the same terms as the corresponding Security
Document then in force), as applicable; (3) immediately after giving effect to the
transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing;
and (4) Top DutchCo shall comply with the provisions of clause (a) of this
clause (5).

**_Disapplication of covenants and release of Liens on a Qualifying IPO_**

In connection with a Qualifying IPO, but (subject to clause (c) of the next paragraph) not earlier
than the date of completion of such Qualifying IPO, (a) the Liens over, or granted by, any Dutch
Security Providers will be released by the Security Agent without any consent from the Holders
and (b) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions under “—Certain
_covenants” will no longer apply or have any effect:_

(1) “—Center of main interests and establishments”;

(2) “—Maintenance of double Dutchco structure”;

(3) “—Limitation on Dutch Security Providers”; and

(4) “—Limitation on Liens” (but only with respect to the Dutch Security Providers).

In addition, the release (including any partial release) of any Lien over any Collateral under any
Security Document and/or the making of any material amendments to any Security Document
will be validly given or made (as applicable) by the Security Agent acting alone and on behalf of
the Holders if such amendment or partial release (i) relates to Liens granted under Security
Documents over securities issued by one or more Dutch Security Providers or Holdco and, (ii) is
made or given (as applicable) in connection with a Qualifying IPO and for the purpose of
allowing:

(c) in respect of a Qualifying IPO of Holdco, the holders of securities issued by Holdco to
debit, and dispose of, any such securities that are credited on the securities accounts
opened in their name and pledged under Security Documents; or

(d) in respect of a Qualifying IPO of a Dutch Security Provider, the holders of securities
issued by that Dutch Security Provider to transfer any such securities free of any charge
or lien; and

(e) in each case up to the maximum number of such securities required for the purpose of
implementing that Qualifying IPO, provided that: (i) no such amendment or partial
release may be implemented or granted more than (10) Business Days prior to the
relevant Qualifying IPO completion date; and (ii) if the Qualifying IPO is not
completed as at the initially contemplated Qualifying IPO completion date (unless
postponed to a subsequent date falling no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
such initially contemplated completion date, in which case the following sentence
shall apply as at such postponed date), the relevant security holders shall promptly
credit back all shares debited from the pledged securities account or (as the case may
be) transferred free of any Lien and, if required, enter into any Security Documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Security Agent and any other relevant
representatives of the relevant secured parties (as the case may be), acting reasonably,
to ensure that such secured parties benefit from the same scope of Collateral under
Security Documents as the one existing prior to the amendment or partial release
mentioned above.

If the Notes are then listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of the consummation of a Qualifying IPO in a newspaper having
general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the
matter permitted by the Irish Stock Exchange, post such notice on the official website of the Irish
Stock Exchange.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

None of Top Dutchco, Dutchco, Holdco or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would
have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and none of Top Dutchco, Dutchco,
Holdco or the Issuer shall, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to
any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the

203


-----

other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that
(i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral
may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) the
applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity,
mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein and (iv) the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely
affect holders of the Notes in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause
(i) or (iv) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any
such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the
solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens
created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified
and secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding) consent to such amendments
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall
Guarantee the Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or
becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes
and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture
pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided, however,
that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent
and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee reasonably be expected to give rise to or
result in (a) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and
coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary; or (c) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes)
other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures
pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in connection with, such Note Guarantee which cannot be
avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. At the
option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“—Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may
also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which

204


-----

could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been
designated as a Guarantor or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which
was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as
at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and
secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5),
(6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the
Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and
release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest
error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that
is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the
Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and
ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its
opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The
Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to
any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted
below under “—Amendments and waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,

205


-----

retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby;
_provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under_
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future
pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at
the offices of the listing agent.

**_Lines of business_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other
than a Permitted Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Payments for consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Secured Notes for
or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions
of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and
is paid to all holders of the Senior Secured Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the
time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in
any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, to
exclude holders of Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where the solicitation of such consent,
waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or the
payment of the consideration therefor, would require the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws
(including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the
European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in
good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be
materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any
substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services
authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under
applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Maintenance of listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the
Senior Secured Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are
outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Senior
Secured Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not
maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a
listing of such Senior Secured Notes on another recognized stock exchange.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment
Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension
_Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior_
Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of
the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured
Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

206


-----

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on sales of assets and Subsidiary stock”; and

(6) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer,”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and
will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from
the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will
be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the
continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during
the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also
permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date
on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation
of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify
the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been
satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the
covenants described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify
Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an
Investment Grade Status.

#### Events of Default

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior
Secured Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, Holdco, any Dutch Security Provider or any Restricted Subsidiary
to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes with the agreements contained in the
Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

207


-----

and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been
a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
€15.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien
and Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1) or (6) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” secured by Collateral that is, in each case, accorded super senior priority_
status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and (A) the 30-day consultation
period under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the enforcement of such
Indebtedness has expired, (B) certain insolvency events have occurred or (C) the
consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement does not apply because the
Senior Secured Creditors (as defined herein) have determined in good faith that to
enter into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or the realization of
proceeds thereof and have instructed the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the
Collateral;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, Holdco, any
Dutch Security Provider or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer, Holdco, any Dutch Security Provider or any Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€15.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in
full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of
€5.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under
the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents, or any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days;

(8) any Notes Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any
Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and
any such Default continues for 10 days;

(9) failure by the Issuer, Holdco or a Dutch Security Provider, as applicable, to comply with
the provisions of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain covenants—
_Center of main interests and establishments,” “—Certain covenants—Maintenance of_
_double_ _Dutchco_ _structure,”_ “—Certain _covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Holdco”_ and
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Dutch Security Providers”; and

(10) failure by the Issuer to comply with any material terms of the Escrow Agreement that
is not cured within 10 days.

208


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee,
may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture to be
due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid
interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the immediately
preceding paragraph has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall
have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing
Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured
Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been
cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become
and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as
provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events
of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and
its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the
Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense caused by
taking or not taking such action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or
interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

209


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will
provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence
by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and
so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of
Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware
which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled
“—Certain covenants —Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole
discretion (including by way of prefunding). It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain
actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

#### Amendments and waivers

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to
an amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
Senior Secured Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

210


-----

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or
change the time at which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as
described under “—Optional redemption”;

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior
Secured Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due
dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding
_Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in_
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that
would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or
an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured
Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or
supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or
the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or
any of the Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance
with the covenant described under “—Certain _covenants—Limitation_ _on_
_Indebtedness” or “—Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the_
Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes,
or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

211


-----

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured
Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent
that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” was intended to
be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties
to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any property which is required by the Security
Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in
the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or_

(10) as provided in “—Certain covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions
of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or
waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a
tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of
such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and
waiver in Ireland in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be
the Irish Times). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may instead be
published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

#### Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the
Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or
indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

#### Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance
trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Notes Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants
described under “Certain covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described

212


-----

under “—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control”
and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above,
the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision,
the guarantee provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Merger and
_consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer, Holdco and the Dutch_
Security Providers), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity,
as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of tax counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial
owners of the relevant Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of tax counsel in the
United States must be based on a ruling received from, or published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
occurring after the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Issuer and the Guarantors;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the
Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

#### Satisfaction and discharge

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange
of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding
Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated
and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain
Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the
funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation;
or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation

213


-----

(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent
in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of
Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture and all sums payable to the Trustee under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; (4) the Issuer
has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date,
as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and
_discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture_
have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (5)).

#### No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of
the Issuer, the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

#### Concerning the Trustee and certain agents

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture
and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent
becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such
Agent.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee
or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

#### Notices

For so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules
of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes will be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). In addition, for
so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Such notices may instead be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be the Irish Times) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not
practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in Europe.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
_provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later_
of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication
mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means
and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it
is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in
via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or
Clearstream.

#### Prescription

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment
thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

#### Currency indemnity and calculation of euro-denominated restrictions

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes
Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other
than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the
extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any
event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of
a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.
These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will
apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum
due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

#### Listing

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock
Exchange and to admit the Senior Secured Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market
thereof. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the Senior Secured Notes on the Global
Exchange Market will be approved and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned
on obtaining such listing.

#### Enforceability of judgments

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the
United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors,
including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

#### Consent to jurisdiction and service

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City
of New York, County and State of New York, United States. The Senior Secured Indenture will
provide that the Issuer, the Dutch Security Providers and each Guarantor will appoint CT
Corporation System as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with
respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New
York state court located in the City of New York.

#### Governing law

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The
Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of England.

defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the commencement of the
period for which the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date

the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation or an Officer’s Certificate certifying that
such designation complied with the foregoing provisions.

owned by the Issuer or another Wholly Owned Subsidiary.

# Book-entry, delivery and form

#### General

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the
“Rule 144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global
Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common
depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of
the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”)
and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under
the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such
participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the
Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants.
The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not
be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights
of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and neither the Paying Agent,
the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor the Escrow Agent will have any responsibility or be liable
for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

#### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes if:

  - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor;

  - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

  - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
either Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the
Indenture.

248


-----

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its
current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in
“Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the
Transfer Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any
Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the
registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration
from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the
part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered
Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we
will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a
holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may
suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Transfer restrictions.”

#### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for
cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the
Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect
the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests

249


-----

will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection
with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

#### Payments on Global Notes

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will
in turn make such payments to the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes.” If any such deduction or
withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Withholding taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary_
in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry
Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or
owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as
the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of BookEntry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the
Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e.,
Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent or any of our or their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a BookEntry Interest;

  - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

#### Currency of payment for the Global Notes

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither we nor the Trustee nor
the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment.

250


-----

#### Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only
at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking
of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its
participants.

#### Transfers

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants,
which rules and procedures may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states
that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed in “Transfer restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the
legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption
(if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor or a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Notes only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and
_exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate_
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes, See “Transfer restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

251


-----

Application will be made to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official List of
the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

#### Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee
nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United
States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a
payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be
performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if
Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes
are set forth under “Listing and general information—Clearing information.”

252


-----

#### Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within
the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and we
urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their
account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial
interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing industry
practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests
or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled
to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants
owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would
authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

# Tax considerations

#### EU Savings Directive

Under the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings
income in the form of interest payments (the “EU Savings Directive”), each Member State of the
European Union is required, since July 1, 2005, to provide to the tax authorities of another
Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) within the meaning of the EU
Savings Directive (“Interest Payments”) made by a paying agent located within its jurisdiction to,
or for the benefit of, an individual resident for tax purposes in that other Member State or to
certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State.

However, for a transitional period, certain Member States (Luxembourg and Austria) may instead
levy withholding tax at a rate of 35% in relation to such Interest Payments. Such transitional
period shall end at the end of the first full fiscal year following the later of (i) the date of entry
into force of an agreement between the European Community and the last of several
jurisdictions (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland), providing for the
exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of
Information on Tax Matters released on April 18, 2002 with respect to Interest Payments made by
paying agents established within their respective territories to beneficial owners resident in the
territory to which the EU Savings Directive applies, in addition to the simultaneous application by
those same jurisdictions of a withholding tax on such Interest Payments at the abovementioned
rate, and (ii) the date on which the European Council unanimously agrees that the United States
of America is committed to exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model
Agreement with respect to Interest Payments made by paying agents established within its
territory to beneficial owners resident in the territory to which the EU Savings Directive applies.
The Luxembourg government has announced that Luxembourg will opt out of the withholding
system in favor of the exchange of information system with effect from January 1, 2015.

A number of non-EU countries and dependent or associated territories, including Switzerland,
have agreed to apply similar measures.

The European Commission has reviewed the EU Savings Directive and proposed certain
amendments which may, if implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements
described above.

#### Certain French tax consequences

The following is a summary of certain material French tax considerations relating to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes by an investor who is not a French tax resident
for French tax purposes, who does not hold the Notes in connection with a permanent
establishment or a fixed base in France and who is neither a shareholder of the Issuer nor a
related party of the Issuer within the meaning of Article 39, 12 of the French tax code (Code
_général des impôts) (the “FTC”)._

This summary is based on the French tax law and regulations in effect and as applied by the
French tax authorities on the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretations.

This summary is for general information only and does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all of the French tax considerations that may be relevant to any prospective
investor.

Prospective investors in the Notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors as to
the French tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Notes in light of their
particular circumstances.

**_EU Savings Directive_**

The EU Savings Directive was implemented into French law under Articles 199 ter and 242 ter of
the FTC. Article 242 ter imposes on paying agents based in France an obligation to report to the
French tax authorities certain information with respect to interest payments made to beneficial
owners domiciled in another Member State, including, among other things, the identity and
address of the beneficial owner and a detailed list of the different categories of interest paid to
that beneficial owner.

254


-----

**_Payments of interest and other revenues with respect to the Notes_**

Payments of interest and other revenues made by a debtor which is established in France with
respect to a particular debt (including debt in the form of notes as the Notes) are not subject to
the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A III of the FTC unless such payments are made
outside France in a non cooperative State or territory (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within
the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative State”). If such payments are
made in a Non-Cooperative State, a 75% withholding tax is applicable (subject to certain
exceptions, certain of which are set forth below and to the more favorable provisions of any
applicable double tax treaty). The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of the
noteholder’s tax residence or registered headquarters. The list of Non-Cooperative States is
published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) which is updated yearly.

Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the FTC, interest on debt and other revenues paid by a
debtor or an issuer of notes that is established in France will not be deductible from the debtor’s
or the issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a
Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such
a Non-Cooperative State. Under certain conditions, any such non deductible interest or other
revenues may be re characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the
FTC, in which case it may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the
FTC, at a rate of 30% or 75% (subject to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double
tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A III of
the FTC, nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine
transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the non deductibility of the
interest or other revenues pursuant to Article 238 A of the FTC and the withholding tax set out
under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC which may be levied as a consequence of such nondeductibility, will apply in respect of a particular issue of debt instruments (including debt in the
form of notes as the Notes) provided that the debtor or the issuer can prove that the main
purpose and effect of such issuance is not to enable payments of interest or other revenues to be
made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”).

Pursuant to French administrative guidelines — Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques — Impôts
BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20120912 n°550 and n°990 — (the “Administrative Guidelines”), an issue of
debt securities benefits from the Exception without the issuer having to provide any evidence
supporting the main purpose and effect of such issuance of debt securities (the “Safe Harbor”), if
such notes are:

  - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French
_Code monétaire et financier (French Monetary and Financial Code) or pursuant to an_
equivalent offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this purpose, an
“equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an
offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); or

  - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or on a multilateral financial
instruments trading facility, provided that such market or facility is not located in an NonCooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment
services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located in a
Non-Cooperative State; or

  - admitted, at the time of their issuance, to the operations of a central depositary or of a
securities clearing and delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of
Article L.561-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier, or of one or more similar foreign
depositaries or operators, provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a
Non-Cooperative State.

Since the Notes issued by the Issuer under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities
under French commercial law and to the extent they are admitted, at the time of their issuance,
to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payment
systems operator within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Code monétaire et
_financier which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments of interest and other_
revenues made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes
will fall under the Safe Harbor.

255


-----

Accordingly, such payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will be
exempt from the withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A III of the FTC. Moreover, under
the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other revenues relate to
genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other
revenues paid by the Issuer to the holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes will not be subject,
pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, to the related non-deductibility rule set forth under
Article 238 A of the FTC and, as a result, will not be subject to the withholding tax set forth
under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC solely on account of their being paid or accrued to a person
domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial
institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State.

**_Taxation on disposal_**

A Noteholder who is not a resident of France for French tax purposes and who does not hold the
Notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in France should
not be subject to any income or withholding taxes in France in respect of the gains realized on
the sale, disposal or other disposition of the Notes.

**_Transfer tax_**

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the transfer of Notes,
except in the case of filing with the French tax authorities on a voluntary basis.

#### Certain general tax considerations — Payments by a Guarantor

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Notes, it is possible that such payments may
be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under
the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may
apply.

#### Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations

TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, YOU ARE HEREBY
NOTIFIED THAT: (I) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS OFFERING
MEMORANDUM IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE RELIED
UPON FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED UNDER THE
INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED; (II) SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN BY
THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF
CIRCULAR 230) OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (III) YOU SHOULD
SEEK ADVICE BASED ON YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX
ADVISOR.

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. holder (as defined below). This summary deals only
with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) by a U.S.
holder who acquires the Notes upon original issuance at their issue price. This summary assumes
that the issue price of the Notes will be the price set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

  - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

  - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

  - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the
“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

256


-----

This summary is based upon provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), the Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on
the date of this Offering Memorandum. Changes in such rules, or new interpretations thereof,
may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax
consequences described below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS with respect to the
statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no
assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court
would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

  - This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S.
federal taxation or all tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of
its particular circumstances. In addition, it does not address the U.S. federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

  - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers
in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method
of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions, individual retirement and
other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment
trusts, S corporations, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

  - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,
constructive sale or conversion transaction, or a straddle;

  - tax consequences to a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

  - tax consequences to U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules;

  - tax consequences to persons who are not U.S. holders;

  - persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States
or who have a taxable presence therein;

  - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;

  - any U.S. federal tax consequences other than income tax consequences; or

  - any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership holding Notes, or a partner in such a
partnership, you should consult your own tax advisor.

**The following discussion is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful**
**tax planning and advice. If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your**
**own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising**
**under any other tax laws, under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in**
**tax law.**

**_Additional payments_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from
payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their_
stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional_
_redemption”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the_
possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of
the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments
under the applicable Treasury Regulations. If we become obligated to pay additional amounts,
then we intend to take the position that such amounts will be treated as ordinary interest

257


-----

income and taxed as described below under “—Payments of stated interest.” If we become
obligated to make additional payments in redemption of the Notes, then we intend to take the
position that such payments will be treated as additional proceeds and taxed as described under
“—Sale, exchange or retirement of Notes.” These positions will be based in part on our
determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional
amounts will have to be paid, or additional payments in redemption of the Notes will have to be
made, was a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury
Regulations.

Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. holder,
unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is
not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. holder
may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield,
regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would
issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions
otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption
or other taxable disposition of the Notes would generally be recharacterized as ordinary income.
Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes
being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes
that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Stated interest on a Note (including any payments of additional amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts so withheld) will be included in your
gross income of as ordinary income at the time that such interest is accrued or received, in
accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount received, determined by
translating the euro received at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received regardless
of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Under applicable Treasury
Regulations, the “spot rate” generally means a rate that reflects a fair market rate of exchange
available to the public for currency under a spot contract involving representative amounts.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes or are
otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt, you may determine the amount of income
recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under
the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar
value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such
interest at the average spot rate for the period or periods during which such interest accrued.
Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the applicable
spot rate on (i) the last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last day of the taxable year if the accrual
period straddles your taxable year or (iii) the date on which the stated interest payment is
received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election
will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the availability and advisability
of making such election.

Upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale or exchange of a
Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously
included in income), a U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes or
is otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt generally will recognize U.S. source
ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of
such payment (determined by translating the euro at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is
received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income previously included in income
with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars. Such amount will not be treated as interest income or expense.

You may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on stated interest
(including any additional amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to

258


-----

deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your other applicable foreign taxes for a particular
tax year). Stated interest income (including any additional amounts) on a Note generally will be
considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will
be considered passive category income. You generally will be denied a foreign tax credit for
foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding
period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the
foreign tax credit are complex and this paragraph discusses those rules only at a high level of
generality. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax
credit under your particular circumstances.

**_Sale, exchange or retirement of Notes_**

If you sell or exchange a Note, or if a Note that you hold is retired, you generally will recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the transaction (less any
amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest that you have not previously included in
income, which amount will be subject to tax in the manner described under “—Payments of
_stated interest”) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note_
generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of your purchase price for the Note on the date of such
purchase decreased by the U.S. dollar value of the aggregate amount of any payments (other
than stated interest) on such Note previously made to you. If you sell or exchange a Note for
euro, or receive euro on the retirement of a Note, the amount you will realize for U.S. federal
income tax purposes generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro that you receive on the
date of such sale, exchange or retirement. However, if the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash-basis U.S. holder (or, if it so elects, an accrual-basis U.S. holder) will
determine the U.S. dollar value of euro received by translating such amount at the spot rate on
the settlement date of the sale, exchange or retirement. Any such election made by an
accrual-basis U.S. holder must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss
that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally will be U.S.-source
capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note
for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of individuals
generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Despite the foregoing, gain or loss that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of a
Note generally will be treated as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain
or loss is foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal of a Note. For these
purposes, the amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized generally will be
equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price of the Note
calculated as of the date of such sale, exchange or retirement (or on the settlement date, if the
Notes are traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash-basis U.S.
holder or an electing accrual-basis U.S. holder) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase
of the Note calculated as of the date you purchased such Note. The amount of foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest that is recognized upon such
sale, exchange or retirement will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on your
disposition of the Note.

**_Exchange of foreign currencies_**

Euro received as interest on a Note will have a basis equal to the U.S. dollar value thereof based
on the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt. Upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a
Note, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash-basis U.S. holder (or,
upon election, an accrual-basis U.S. holder) will have a basis in the euro received equal to the
U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of such sale, exchange
or retirement. In all other cases, (i) the U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss to the extent
that the U.S. dollar value of the euro received (based on the spot rate in effect on the date of
receipt) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the euro on the date of the sale, exchange or
retirement of the Note, and (ii) the U.S. holder’s basis in the euro received will equal the U.S.
dollar value of the euro, based on the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss

259


-----

recognized by a U.S. holder on a sale, exchange or other disposition of such euro will be ordinary
income or loss and generally will be U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit
purposes.

**_Reportable transactions_**

You may be required to report a sale or other disposition of your Notes (or if you are an
accrual-basis U.S. holder, a payment of accrued interest) on IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement) if you recognize foreign currency exchange loss that equals or
exceeds certain threshold amounts. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor to determine
the reporting obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886.

**_Foreign financial asset reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information on the holding of certain foreign
financial assets, including the debt of foreign entities, if the aggregate value all of these assets
exceeds certain threshold amounts. The Notes are expected to constitute foreign financial assets
subject to these requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial
institutions. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this
reporting obligation.

**_Medicare contribution tax_**

Certain U.S. holders are individuals, estates or trusts will be required to pay up to an additional
3.8% tax on interest and capital gains. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding
the effect, if any, of such additional tax on your ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Payments in respect of the Notes that are made within the United States or through certain
U.S.-related financial intermediaries are subject to information reporting and may be subject to
backup withholding unless you (i) properly establish that you are a corporation or other exempt
recipient or (ii) in the case of backup withholding, provide an accurate taxpayer identification
number and certify that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred or
otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability. You may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for
a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

# Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and
the security interests in some of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantees or the Collateral is
being provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar
event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a
future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions
could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your
ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and
the security interests in the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects
of insolvency law in France and the Netherlands.

#### European Union

The Guarantors in France and the security providers in France and the Netherlands are
incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, on insolvency proceedings, as
amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than
Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (as
that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where a company has its “center of
main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a
company has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered
office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states
that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by
third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the
“center of main interests” of a company, including, in particular, where board meetings are held,
the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and
the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “center
of main interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding
which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing
of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the “center of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark)
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other
than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that company
only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An
“establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries on
non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency
proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company
situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its
center of main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in
which the company has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding up
proceedings” listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the
Member State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened,
territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company
has an establishment only where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the
Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member
State’s law; or (ii) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor
that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or
whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.

261


-----

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
opening the main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States
so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a
court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s
center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him or her by the law of
that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that
other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have
been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary
further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
company has assets.

#### France

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of prevention of corporate difficulties and
insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational purposes only and does not
address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the Notes.
References to the holders of the Notes below include the holders of the Notes acting through, or
in place of, the Issuer with respect to the Collateral.

French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil
Code (Code civil), ad hoc agency proceedings (mandats ad hoc), conciliation proceedings
(procédure de conciliation), safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde financière accélérée) and judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency
legislation favors the continuation of a business and the protection of employment over the
payment of creditors.

Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than
Denmark), French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center
of the debtor’s main interests is situated in France. In the case of a company or legal person, the
place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the center of its main interests in the
absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the center of main interests of a
company is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual elements.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to pre-insolvency and insolvency laws discussed below, the holders of the Notes could,
like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil
proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into
account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise
reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations over a maximum period of two years and
decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear
interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate) or
that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal. If a court order under
Articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcement
measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due
during the period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods.
When the debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read
in combination with Article L611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see “—Conciliation
_proceedings”)._

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements)
when it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with its available assets taking into account
available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

**_Mandat ad hoc proceedings_**

A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of mandat ad hoc proceedings, the
aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders.

262


-----

French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of mandat ad hoc proceedings, except
that these proceedings (i) are confidential by law and (ii) may only be initiated by the debtor
company itself, in its sole discretion. Mandat ad hoc proceedings are not limited in time and are
informal proceedings carried out under the supervision of the President of the relevant court
(usually the Commercial Court), which do not involve any stay of the proceedings.

A company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is not insolvent; see “—Insolvency
_test”) may request from the court the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc, whose name it can_
suggest. The mandataire ad hoc’s duties are determined by the court. Such mandataire ad hoc is
usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with creditors but they cannot coerce the
creditors into accepting any proposal. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the
help of such mandataire ad hoc can be reported by the latter to the president of the court but is
not approved by the court. The restructuring agreement between the company and its main
creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not
willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking
legal action against the company to recover their claims but, in practice, they usually accept not
to do so.

In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set
forth above.

**_Conciliation proceedings_**

A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of conciliation proceedings
(procédure de conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders.

Points that conciliation proceedings have in common with mandat ad hoc proceedings are
(i) confidentiality by law and (ii) they may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its
sole discretion. Main differences include (i) the conditions to open conciliation proceedings,
(ii) the limitation in time of conciliation proceedings, (iii) the right to petition the president of
the Commercial Court for a grace period and (iv) the ability to acknowledge or approve the
restructuring agreement.

A company may, in its sole discretion, apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings with
respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”), or has been insolvent for
fewer than 45 days and (ii) experiences current or predictable legal, economic or financial
difficulties. The debtor petitions the president of the Commercial Court for the appointment of a
conciliator (whose name he or she can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating
with some or all of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement that provides for the
restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last up to
five months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of
their claims but they usually in practice accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains the
right to petition the president of the Commercial Court for a grace period.

This agreement may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the court or
approved (homologué) by the court. It will become binding upon them and the creditors party
thereto may not take action against the company in respect of claims governed by the
agreement.

The acknowledgement of the agreement by the president of the court upon all parties’ request,
gives the agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial
title that can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge (titre exécutoire),
but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

The conciliation agreement can also be approved by the court upon the debtor’s request. It will
have the following specific consequences:

  - creditors who provided new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation
of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity)
will have priority of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other
than certain post-proceeding employment claims and procedural costs), in the event of
subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial
liquidation proceedings; and

263


-----

  - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements and therefore the commencement
date of the suspect period cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of
the approval of the agreement by the court.

A third party having granted a guarantee (sûreté personnelle) or a security interest (sûreté réelle)
can benefit from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged agreement.

In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for
its termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put
an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and
security interests, for those amounts already paid to them.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is
supported by a large majority of creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory
preliminary step of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

**_Safeguard proceedings_**

A company may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde)
with respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) and (ii) experiences
difficulties that it is not able to overcome. Creditors of the company do not attend the hearing
before the court at which the opening of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the
opening of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator is usually appointed to
investigate the business of the company during an initial observation period, which may last up
to 18 months, and helps the company elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de
_sauvegarde). Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the_
hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and
are overseen by the court.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the
opening of the proceedings is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the
bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property
needed for the continued operation of the business or recover goods or rights transferred as
collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to
declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) the debts that
arose prior to the opening of the procedure (as well as the post-opening non-privileged debts)
and are prohibited from engaging any individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment
default in relation to such debts (see “—Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings,
_accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial_
_liquidation proceedings”) and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year,_
or payments deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement
of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’s activities
during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in
consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when
they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to
the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the
“new money lien”).

In the case of large companies (with more than 150 employees or turnover greater than
€20 million) or upon request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, two creditors’
committees (one for credit institutions (or assimilated institutions and entities having granted
credit or advances in favor of the debtor) and their successive assignees having a claim against
the debtor, and the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total
amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers) will then be established. These committees will
be consulted on the safeguard plan drafted by the debtor’s management during the observation
period. In addition, any member of a committee may submit proposals for drawing up a
safeguard plan to the debtor and the court-appointed administrator.

The committees must announce whether they approve or reject the safeguard plan within a
minimum of 15 days of its submission. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each
committee, provided that the majority is two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors

264


-----

expressing a vote. The amounts of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a
guarantee granted by the debtor are not taken into account. In addition, creditors for whom the
plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedule or provides for a payment of
their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted
do not take part in the vote.

If there are any noteholders, they are required to vote on the plan during a general meeting of
all noteholders (even if they relate to different issues and regardless of the law applicable to
each issue) held for that purpose and approve the plan at the same two-thirds majority vote.
Approval of the plan at the two-thirds majority shall, if the plan is approved by the court, bind all
the members of the committees and the noteholders (including those who voted against the
adoption of the plan). The plan submitted to the committees and the noteholders, if any, must
take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings, may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their
differences in situation and may notably include rescheduling or cancelling debts, and/or debtfor-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If, within the first six months of the observation period, the creditors’ committees and the
noteholders’ meeting approve the plan, and subject to verification by the court that the interests
of all creditors are sufficiently safeguarded and to a rescheduling of the claims of creditors who
are not members of the committees or noteholders (as discussed hereinafter), the court will
approve the plan. With respect to creditors who are not members of the committees, or in the
event no committees are established, proposals are made to each creditor collectively or
individually.

For those creditors (outside the creditors’ committee or the noteholders’ meeting) who have not
reached a negotiated agreement, the court can impose a uniform rescheduling of the repayment
of their debts over a maximum period of ten years, except for debts with maturity dates of more
than ten years, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same. The court cannot obligate
such creditors to waive any part of their claims or accept debt-for-equity swaps. The first
payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and
subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total
amount of the debt claims).

In the event that the debtor company’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and
the general meeting of noteholders within the first six months of the observation period, either
because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it, the court can still adopt a
safeguard plan in the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case the
rules are the same as the ones applicable to creditors who are not part of the committees and
who are not noteholders and, in particular, the court can only impose a uniform rescheduling of
the repayment of the debts over a maximum period of ten years (as described in the preceding
paragraphs).

The court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) may decide not to consult
on the plan for those creditors (outside any such committee or meeting). Creditors for whom the
plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedules or provides for a complete
reimbursement in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are
admitted do not need to be consulted on the plan.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are opened against the
Issuer, the holders of the Notes will be treated as noteholders of the Issuer and will take part in
the general meeting of noteholders and the noteholders’ committees, if any. Therefore, the
holders of the Notes would not be a member of the credit institutions’ committee but would
vote on any draft plan proposed by the Issuer as members of the general meeting of noteholders.

A draft plan (the approval of which would require a two-thirds majority vote of each committee
and the general meeting of the noteholders) prepared by the Issuer’ management and proposed
by the Issuer to its creditors could include, among other things, debt rescheduling or the
cancellation of debts, and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant
shareholders’ consent). Holders of the Notes could, as members of the general meeting of
noteholders, veto such plan if they reach a blocking minority (i.e., their claims represent more
than one-third of the claims of those creditors casting a vote in the meeting). Conversely, if a

265


-----

two-thirds majority is reached in each committee or meeting and the plan is subsequently
approved by the relevant court, the plan will bind all the creditors of the Issuer (including
noteholders and notably holders of the Notes, and the members of the creditor’s committees
who voted against the adoption of the plan during the vote taken by the applicable general
meeting of noteholders or committee).

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the bank debt claim will be invited onto the credit
institutions’ committee. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not
itself be a member of the credit institutions’ committee.

**_Accelerated financial safeguard proceedings_**

Envisaged as a means of facilitating “pre-pack” bankruptcies in France, accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (“AFS”) permit a debtor having prepared in conciliation proceedings a
draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his or her business as a going concern
supported by enough of its financial creditors (i.e., members of the credit institutions’ committee
and noteholders) to render likely its adoption (at the two-thirds majority applicable in safeguard
proceedings) by the credit institutions’ committee and the noteholders’ meeting, if any, within a
maximum of two months of the commencement of the proceedings. Only financial creditors
(e.g., creditor members of the credit institutions’ committee and noteholders) are implicated in
such a restructuring plan and consulted on the draft safeguard plan, and therefore an AFS filing
does not affect or entail the suspension of payments to creditors other than financial creditors
(e.g., suppliers).

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of an AFS may
notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital in
the debtor company (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholders’ consent).

In order to file for an AFS, the debtor company must (i) be engaged in a conciliation procedure;
(ii) justify the preparation of a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his or her
business as a going concern supported by enough of its financial creditors to render likely its
adoption by the credit institutions’ committee and the noteholders’ meeting; (iii) not be
insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”); (iv) face financial difficulties which it finds itself unable to
overcome and (v) have (a) either more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million
or (b) a total balance sheet exceeding (aa) €25 million or (bb) €10 million if they control another
company (α) which has more than 150 employees, (ß) the turnover of which for the previous
financial year is greater than €20 million or (γ) the total balance sheet of which exceeds
€25 million. Therefore, based on currently applicable regulations, the Issuer is currently eligible
for AFS proceedings.

Creditors, other than financial creditors, such as public creditors, the tax or social security
administration and suppliers are not directly impacted by the AFS. Their debts will continue to be
due and payable according to their contractual or legal terms.

Since the AFS is by nature an accelerated procedure, very tight deadlines are imposed. The
Commercial Court must approve any restructuring plan within one month of the date on which
the procedure has begun, although this deadline may be extended by up to a maximum of one
additional month. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within such
deadlines, the court is obligated to terminate the procedure.

**_Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire) may be
initiated against or by a company only if it is insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) and, for the
liquidation proceedings only, if the company’s recovery is manifestly impossible. Note that a
recent decision from the French Constitutional Court dated December 7, 2012 n°2012-286QPC
held anti-constitutional the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings by the court
at its own initiative (the same reasoning is likely to apply to judicial liquidation proceedings). The
company is required to petition for insolvency proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings)
within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and,
as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to incurring civil liability.

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months

266


-----

before the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at
an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency is important
because it marks the beginning of the suspect period. Certain transactions undertaken during the
suspect period may be void or voidable.

The court order commencing the proceedings may order either the liquidation or the
reorganization of the company. In the event of reorganization, an administrator is usually
appointed by the court (administrateur judiciaire) to investigate the business of the company
during an initial observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and makes proposals either
for the reorganization of the company (by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization
plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the
company. However, it cannot be ruled out that further to the aforementioned decision from the
French Constitutional Court, the constitutionality of the conversion of a safeguard or judicial
reorganization procedure into judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, when it is
decided upon the court’s own initiative, can be challenged. Committees of creditors and
noteholders’ meeting may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings. At
any time during this observation period, the court can order the liquidation of the company. At
the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

**_Void and voidable transaction_**

“Void transactions” include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that
may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the
reciprocal obligations of the company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of
debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner that is not commonly used in
the ordinary course of business, any escrow ordered by a judicial decision if such decision is not
final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts
previously incurred, any provisional measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates
the date of insolvency) operations relating to stock options, fiduciary transfers (unless the
transfer is made as a security for an indebtedness entered into simultaneously) and modifications
to existing fiduciary transfers securing previous debts.

“Voidable transactions” include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the suspect period if the_
party dealing with the debtor company knew that it was insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”).
Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when
entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect period.

**_Creditors’ liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced,
creditors may be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor
only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and, in the case of fraud, interference with
the management of the debtor or if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are
disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support
facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable in such circumstances can be cancelled or
reduced by the court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de
facto manager of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such a case, Article L 651-2 of the French
Commercial Code provides that, if judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have
been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of
liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de
facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the
company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the
managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

**_Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings,_**
**_judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings_**

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose claims arose prior to the commencement
of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) within two months of the publication of the court order in the Bulletin
_Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales (BODACC) (by exception, the deadline begins upon_
the receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claims arose out of a published
contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four
months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have not submitted their claims
during the relevant period are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from
receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to
such limits and are preferential creditors under French law.

From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard, accelerated
financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings), the company is
prohibited from paying (i) debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to specified exceptions,
which essentially concern the set-off of interrelated debts and payments made to recover assets
for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that such
payments are authorized by the bankruptcy judge and (ii) debts arising after the opening of the
proceedings if such debts are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non-privileged debts).
During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect
to any claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings or, as the case may be,
for the aforementioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective of such legal action
is:

  - to obtain an order for or a payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court fix the amount due); or

  - to terminate a contract for nonpayment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company or
to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset,
whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member
State, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the
insolvency procedure, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 of EC Regulation
1346/2000.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however:

(i) debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or noteholders should
be paid in the ordinary course; and

(ii) the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the
conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence,
its accountant). Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the
regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and
merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the
debtor (within the two or four months’ time limit). Those financial creditors who did
not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be party to the financial
institutions’ committee or the noteholders’ meeting) would have to file their proofs of
claim within the aforementioned legal time limits.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the
occurrence of (i) the opening of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, (ii) accelerated
financial safeguard or (iii) insolvency (cessation des paiements) are not enforceable under French
law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of
all of a company’s obligations unless the continued operation of the business with a view to the
adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) is ordered by the court (three
months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the
date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on
which the continued operation of the business ends.

The court-appointed administrator may elect to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours)
which he or she believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. On the contrary, he

268


-----

or she may require the continuation of such contracts provided that the company fully performs
its post-petition contractual obligations, or may decide not to continue them. The court can also
set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the continuation of the
business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If the court adopts a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) in judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings with a temporary continuation of the business, the
proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the payment of creditors according to their ranking.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the company, the court will appoint a
liquidator to sell the assets of the company and settle the relevant debts in accordance with their
ranking. However, in practice, where a plan for the sale of the business is considered, it will
usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the company and organize such sale of the
business.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including
employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to
insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part of the approved conciliation agreement, have
provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the event of judicial
liquidation proceedings, post-petition creditors, the French State, other prepetition secured
creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors

**_Limitations on the Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each guarantor incorporated in France (a “French Guarantor”)
are subject to:

  - certain exceptions, including to the extent any obligations which, if incurred, would
constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the
French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or
L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and

  - French corporate benefit rules, in particular, without limitations, should a Guarantee by
granted by a French Guarantor other than the Parent Guarantor, a financial limitation
corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the Offering which the Issuer
would apply for the direct or indirect benefit of each French Guarantor through any
intercompany loans and/or cash-pooling arrangements that would be outstanding on the
date a payment would be requested to be made by such French Guarantor.

Accordingly, any guarantee by a French Guarantor (other than the Parent Guarantor) will be
limited to amounts that represent either (i) the amount of debt that each such French Guarantor
and/or the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor (if any) will be deemed to have
refinanced with the proceeds of the Notes through intercompany loans, or (ii) the amounts of
such proceeds that will be made available to such French Guarantor, and/or the controlled
subsidiaries of that French Guarantor (if any), via the group’s cash-pooling arrangements or
otherwise. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the guarantees
could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor
may have effectively no obligation under its guarantee.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic
return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction
entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and
that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if
payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return
the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not
receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the
guarantee as a whole. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and
whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of
fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations,
the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and in the corporate interests of the guarantor

269


-----

company. French case law has recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including
upstream guarantees) can be in the corporate interests of the relevant company, particularly if
the following criteria are fulfilled:

  - the existence of a genuine group of companies operating under a common strategy work
towards a common objective;

  - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

  - the transaction must maintain a balance between the financial commitments of the
relevant affiliates;

  - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or
advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee; and

  - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial
capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts
guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French
case law provides no clear guidance.

**_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured
amount that is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public
auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets; or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure
(attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors,
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets.
Enforcement by way of contractual foreclosure may not be agreed at the time of the granting of
the security or subsequently and, therefore, the holders of the Note will not benefit from such
enforcement method.

If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial foreclosure
or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of
the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by a precontractually agreed expert in the context of a
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In any event, if the value of the pledged assets
exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the
pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets and the
amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the collateral. On the
contrary, if the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant
amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such
shares, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee
and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the
creditors by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as trustees
(fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agents (agents des sûretés)
under Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code, which is not the case here for the security
documents governed by French law. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will
not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit
indirectly from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a
“Parallel Debt.” Pursuant to such Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may
not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the

270


-----

Collateral. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held (in a decision dated
September 13, 2011 rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings commenced in France)
that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the
laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international
public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a
parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in
all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an
enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral.

_Trustee_

Pledges governed by French law will be granted to the benefit of the Security Agent as trustee
for the holders of the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and may
therefore not directly be granted to holders of the Notes. A concept of “trust” has been
recognized for tax purposes by Article 792-0 bis of the FTC and the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) has held, in the Belvedere decision referred to above in respect of the parallel debt_
concept, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opened in France.
However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the
La Haye Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so
that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

_Fraudulent conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions, which offer creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including,
without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of
the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s
or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security
and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the
commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) insolvency
proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside
insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable
against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the
creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was
performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their
means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which
case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds
of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the
security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the
Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such guarantee
could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the
creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful
challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees or the
security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes
received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantees could
also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent
transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for
any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

#### The Netherlands

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Dutch Security Providers may be affected by (i) the
standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (ii) force
majeure (niet- _toerekenbare_ _tekortkoming)_ and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden); and (iii) the other general defenses available to pledgors and debtors under_
Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of Dutch law security
rights. Other general defenses include claims that a security interest should be voided because it
was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog),
duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights of suspension
(opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). The enforceability
of the obligations of the Dutch Security Providers may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction
Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court
for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in
respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Security Providers under the Notes
may be successfully contested by a Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in
suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim,
which will be successful if both (i) the obligations of the company do not fall within the scope of
the objects clause as set forth in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and
(ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In
determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects and purposes of a Dutch
company, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the company’s articles of
association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of such security
interest is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit
and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest.
The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in a Dutch
company’s objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

In connection with the removal of the prohibition on financial assistance for Dutch private
limited liability companies as of October 1, 2012, it was mentioned in the Dutch Parliament that
the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party
of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company
could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute ultra vires. At present, there is no
Dutch case law on this subject.

To the extent that pursuant to an agreement to which a Dutch private company is a party, it is
required or forbidden to take, or restricted in taking, any action that falls within the powers of
its general meeting of shareholders, it may not be binding on and enforceable against it.

A security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended or voided in the case of
(suspected) mismanagement by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders
of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor
with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such
motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or,
provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts issued
therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. A trade union and other entities entitled thereto in the articles of
association of the relevant Dutch company may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber
for this purpose. The security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual
payment under it may be suspended or voided.

Under Dutch law, any creditor of a Dutch Security Provider or its receiver (curator) may nullify
any transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Security Provider in connection with the
Notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch
Security Provider in connection with the Notes was conducted without prior existing legal
obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their
bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act
(irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions); and (iii) at the

272


-----

time of the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Security Provider in connection with
the Notes was conducted, the relevant Dutch Security Provider and, unless the transactions were
conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one
or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A
receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent
debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the above-mentioned elements of fraudulent
conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by
law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an
adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important
application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the
other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and
acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by
the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of
companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a
bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a
bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis
of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was
conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed
or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the
counterparty in order to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be
challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

In the event that any one or more of the Dutch Security Providers or any of their subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the
security of the Dutch Security Providers. Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, it is not clear where
registered shares in a Dutch private limited liability companies are situated so that a court may
determine that those shares are situated in France or in any other jurisdiction and the
enforcement of a security interest in the shares of that Dutch company may be affected by
French insolvency laws or the laws of that other jurisdiction. The contemplated revision of the EU
Insolvency Regulation may clarify that registered shares are situated within the Member State in
the territory of which the company having issued the shares has its registered office (statutaire
_zetel). However, we cannot assure that a revision will take place and if it does, a revision to that_
effect will actually come into force during the life of the Notes.

The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not
prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the
situation has a close connection (and for this purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the
respect for which is regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to
such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of
the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not)
which must be applied pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard
having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to
the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance.

In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including
allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares
may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of
association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of
third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder
_trouw) may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in_
the Collateral.

In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public
auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant
security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the
security assets, except when otherwise agreed. In the case of pledged assets, the Security Agent
and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the
pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to

273


-----

determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the
case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a
private sale may be excluded.

Under Dutch law, certain “accessory” security interests such as rights of pledge require that the
pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of
third parties who do not hold the secured claim. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the
Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation
of separate and independent debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders
of the Notes under or in connection with the indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel
Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations.

The security interests are granted to the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes
offered hereby, in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name, pursuant to the Parallel
Debt and not as a representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the holders of the Notes. The deed of
pledge governed by Dutch law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure
the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The
beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents and those holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in
respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some
instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). As a result, the holders of
the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under Dutch law and we
cannot assure you that this parallel debt structure will mitigate or eliminate the risk of
unenforceability posed by Dutch law. To the extent that the security interests in the collateral
created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the
Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the
collateral.

**_Insolvency laws_**

The Dutch Security Providers are incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Dutch
Security Providers have their “center of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands,”
they may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject
to certain exceptions as provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation.

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law: (i) suspension of
payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a
debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern; and (ii) bankruptcy
(faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its
creditors. Bankruptcy is the most commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer
of parts of the company as a going concern. A suspension of payments often results in the
debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet).

Only the board of directors of the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments,
and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the
application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of
payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is
required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted,
unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors
represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the
amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against
it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension
of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the
(near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must
be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving
a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of

274


-----

the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months
(extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to
Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), a suspension of payments will only
affect unsecured, non- preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor
may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under
the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to suspension of payments or (ii) seek
recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts.
Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At
least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be
due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.
Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het _Openbaar_ _Ministerie)_ can request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch
bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed
to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the
extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims.
Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such
as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from suspension of payments or
bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the
security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to
Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of
execution in suspension of payment; (ii) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose
its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to
Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the
relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of
liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s
receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment
and bankruptcy proceedings against the Dutch Security Providers would allow secured creditors
(and in the case of the suspension of payments, preferential creditors (including tax and social
security authorities) as well) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure
their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay
of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of
payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue
of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the
bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher-ranking
rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security
authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above
may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its
security interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time limit is not met, the receiver will
be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim
in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the
bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be
returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the
secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it
may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the
claim used for the set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law
when a suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy
is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the
suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the
court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to
set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order
is automatically stayed.

275


-----

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be
offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential
creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of
creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the
claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and (ii) subsequently ratified
(gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the
ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a
holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing
after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in
a composition.

Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency
proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Furthermore, the claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch
law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in
accordance with its terms. Claims (i) subject to a condition precedent (opschortende voorwaarde)
(ii) with an uncertain due date or which entitles the claimant to periodic payments and (iii) which
fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution
purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one
year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy
was declared.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in
order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions.
“Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the
treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy,
the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for verification, and the
receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether
and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the
situation of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims
will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the
amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court will decide
how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders
of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover
in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the
holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on the Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date
cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be
admitted pro memoria. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security,
the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of
unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

# Plan of distribution

#### General

The Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase
agreement dated on or about, 2014 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears
on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at
which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates and agents, including
in respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer
and the Parent Guarantor will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in
addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Sales of the Notes may be made
through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers or through registered brokers.

#### Notes are not being registered

The Notes and the Parent Guarantee have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable
state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of
Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are
registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”).
Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations
and agreements described under “Transfer restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers will not offer or
sell the Notes except to persons they reasonably expect to be qualified institutional buyers or
pursuant to offers and sales in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the
Notes are restricted as described under “Transfer restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale
of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and
(ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes and the Parent Guarantee may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any
country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation
would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised
to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to this Offering, the
distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

277


-----

The Issuer and the Parent Guarantor have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell,
contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under
circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the
exemption afforded by the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S
to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

#### No sale of similar securities

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided
under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or parent guarantee by, the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates (other than any securities
issued by any funds managed or controlled by TowerBrook, Investcorp or entities controlled by
such funds which have no relationship or connection otherwise with the Issuer, the Parent
Guarantor or their respective subsidiaries or holding companies but are affiliates solely due to
the fact that TowerBrook or Investcorp have an equity interest in such entity) that are
substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement
through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of this Offering without prior
written consent.

#### New issue of securities

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on
the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the
Global Exchange Market thereof. No certainty can be given that this application will be granted,
and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop.

The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make
a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to
you. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

#### Initial settlement

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or
about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the
business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act)
following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”).
Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
following business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will
settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
pricing or the next succeeding business day should consult their own advisors.

#### Price stabilization and short positions

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may over-allot the Notes or
effect transactions, for a limited period after the Issue Date, with a view to supporting the
market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. The
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also create
syndicate short positions, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in

278


-----

market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty
bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities
and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the
liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Any such
stabilizing action, if begun, may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of
30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading_
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

#### Other relationships

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and original
lenders under our new Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and are or will be counterparties in
the hedging arrangements we expect to roll over and carry forward or enter into in connection
with the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates will receive customary fees and
commissions in such capacities. J.P. Morgan Europe Limited will act as the agent under the
Revolving Credit Facility and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited will act as the Security Agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past
and may currently be providing and may provide in the future, investment banking, commercial
lending, consulting and advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of
business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. Oddo &
Cie is currently advising us in the context of the Refinancing and will receive a fee for its services.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities
activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates routinely
hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically,
such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including (potentially) the Notes offered hereby. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

# Transfer restrictions

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other_
_transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

#### General

The Issuer has not registered and will not register the Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S.
Securities Act or any state securities laws and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold
within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
Accordingly, the Notes are only being offered and sold:

  - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” or “QIBs” (as defined in Rule 144A)
in compliance with Rule 144A; and

  - outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S.

We use the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

# Enforceability of judgments

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and certain security
providers are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. Each of the documents relating to
the Collateral for the Notes will be governed by the laws of France or the Netherlands, as
applicable. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Notes will be governed by New
York law. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law. All of the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the large majority of the directors and
executive officers of Top DutchCo are non residents of the United States. Since substantially all
the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the
Guarantors or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated
upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the
United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in
each case in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S.
securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such
other persons mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, the Guarantors or a security provider,
investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions in which the relevant company has
assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is
described below for the countries in which the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain security
providers are located, you should consult your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as
needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

#### France

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of
civil law entitlements in connection with the Notes against the Issuer and the Guarantors,
incorporated and existing under French law.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial
matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable
in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings
(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has
exclusive jurisdiction over such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex
parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following cumulative conditions have
been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign
judgment):

  - such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it;

  - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because
the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no
international forum-shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the
French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

  - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, which include particularly the
right to a fair trial;

  - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law (for example, the parties
did not submit the dispute to a foreign court in order to intentionally avoid the
application of French law); and

285


-----

  - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that
has become effective in France, and there is no risk of conflict with proceedings pending
before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the
same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial
decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French
law.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment is likely to
benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and is
thus likely to be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur
can be appealed.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely
affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by
French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000
(relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial,
industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or
restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action or in contemplation thereof. If these regulations were applicable, the
U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the
Taking of Evidence Abroad) and French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from
French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data
files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011-1012 of
August 24, 2011) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in
France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a
discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign
law designated by the applicable French rule of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties
to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to
contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French
courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities
laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance
of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign
country with French persons (Article 14). Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French
national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the
performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the
foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as
meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will
to appear in a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the
French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action
has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the
litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may
waive his or her rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil
Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

Our French counsel has also advised us that the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has
ruled in 2012 that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a
court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any relevant court with
jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was unduly discretionary (potestative). Accordingly,
any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party
submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an
action in the French courts. This ruling does not apply to choice of courts provisions designating
arbitration tribunals.

#### The Netherlands

The Dutch Security Providers are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in
the Netherlands. The large majority of the directors of the Dutch Security Providers reside outside
the United States and a substantial amount of the Dutch Security Providers’ assets are located
outside of the United States. Service of process in U.S. proceedings on persons in the Netherlands
is regulated by a multilateral treaty guaranteeing the service of writs and other legal documents
in civil cases if the current address of the defendant is known. The enforcement in the
Netherlands of foreign judgments is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. A competent Dutch
court will apply Dutch private international law to determine which law applies to any private
law claim brought before it and apply that law to such claim. Civil liabilities based on the
securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an
original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the
United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be
enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment that is enforceable in the
Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court in accordance with
Dutch rule of civil procedure. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same
judgment without re-litigation on the merits, provided (i) that judgment results from legal
proceedings compatible with Dutch notions of due process, (ii) that judgment does not
contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands and (iii) the jurisdiction of the
relevant federal or state court in the United States was based on internationally accepted
principles of private international law. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of
process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce judgments
in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in the Netherlands.
However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is
doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Statutory auditors’ review report on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements as**
**of and for the ten-month period ended October 31, 2013**

To the Chairman,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of Parts Holdings (France) and in accordance with your
request in connection with the offering of the notes to be issued by Autodis S.A. and
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parts Holdings (France), we have performed a
review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France) as
of and for the ten-month period ended October 31, 2013, consisting of the unaudited
consolidated statement of financial position of Parts Holdings (France) as at October 31, 2013 and
the related unaudited consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated statement of
changes in equity for the ten-month periods ended October 31, 2013 with corresponding figures
for the ten-month period ended October 31, 2012 together with the related condensed
footnotes thereto, the accompanying “Financial Information”.

The preparation of this Financial Information is the responsibility of your chairman. Our role is to
express a conclusion on this Financial Information based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A
review primarily consists of making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Financial Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34 — IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

Without modifying the conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to note 3.2 which
discloses the impacts of the application by your company of IAS 19 Revised “Employee Benefits”,
to the notes 3.2 and 7 with respect to Segment information transition and to the notes 3.2 and
20.1 with respect to the accounting for the SUP bonds.

This report is governed by French law. The courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction over
any claim, dispute or difference resulting from our engagement letter or the present report, or
any related matters. Each party irrevocably waives its right to oppose any action brought before
French courts, to claim that the action is being brought before an illegitimate court or that the
courts have no jurisdiction.

the Dutch Trade and Companies Registry under number 30254923, having its registered office at
Boulevard 329, 1118 BJ Luchthaven, Schiphol, Netherlands.

#### 3. Summary of significant accounting policies

**3.1. Statement of compliance**

The Interim Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on
31 October 2013 and available on the following website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm.

In particular, these Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34
“Interim Financial Reporting”. They do not include all the information and disclosures required in
the annual IFRS Financial Statements. They should be read in conjunction with the Group’s
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, approved by the
Chairman on 29 March 2013.

The Group’s Interim Financial Statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value. The Interim Financial Statements are presented in
millions of euros and all values are rounded up to the nearest million unless when otherwise
stated.

**3.2. Basis of preparation**

In accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”, the Interim Financial Statements
have been prepared on the going concern basis that Parts Holdings France S.A.S. will continue its
operation for the foreseeable future.

Except as described below, the accounting principles and adopted methods applied in the
following Interim Financial Statements are identical to those used and described in the notes to
Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.

These Interim Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34
“Interim Financial Reporting” in connection and for purposes of the proposed international
offering and listing on the Irish Stock Exchange of Senior Secured Notes by Autodis S.A., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group with the guaranty of Parts Holdings France S.A.S. in early
2014. Accordingly, these Interim Financial Statements include segment information under IFRS 8
“Operating Segments” (see Note 7 “Segment Information”).

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The SUP Bonds (contingent value instruments) issued as part of the safeguard proceedings of
2009 have been remeasured at fair value as further described in Note 20.1 “Group Financing”.

Further, the following new standards and interpretations which are applicable starting from
1 January 2013, did not have any significant effect on the Group’s Interim Financial Statements as
of and for the ten-month period ended 31 October 2013, with the exception of the amendment
to IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”.

**_New accounting standards and interpretations with effect starting from 2013_**

The Group has applied the following new amendments, standards and interpretations previously
endorsed by the European Union, which are effective as of 1 January 2013:

- Amendments to Revised IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” eliminates the option to defer the
recognition of actuarial gains and losses, under the “corridor method”, removes the concept of
expected returns on plan assets, requires immediate recognition of past service costs which
previously were expensed on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits
become vested, modifies the presentation of changes in assets and liabilities arising from
defined benefit plans, including a requirement to present the re-measurements in other
comprehensive income (OCI), and increases the disclosure requirements for defined plans,
including the disclosure of information about the characteristics of defined plans and the risks
that entities are exposed to through participation in those plans.

Furthermore, the interest cost and expected return on plan assets used in the previous version
of IAS 19 are replaced with a “net interest” amount, which is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

The amendments to IAS 19 are effective as of 1 January 2013 and must be applied
retrospectively. As a result, the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2012 has
been restated. The impacts of the application of IAS 19 Revised are further described below.

- IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell
and asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
measurement date. It sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and
replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements in other
IFRSs, including IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”. Note 20.1 includes the additional
disclosures required at the interim reporting date in this respect.

The application of IFRS 13 has no significant impact on the valuation of the assets and liabilities
of the Group.

- As a result of the amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”, the Group has
modified the presentation of items of other comprehensive income in its unaudited condensed
interim consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to present separately items that will
be reclassified to profit or loss in the future from those that will never be. Comparative
information as of 31 October 2012 has also been restated accordingly.

The adoption of the amendments to IAS 1 has no impact on the recognized assets, liabilities
and comprehensive income of the Group.

- Currently IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’, requires an entity to measure the deferred tax relating to an
asset depending on whether the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset
through use or sale. It can be difficult and subjective to assess whether recovery will be
through use or through sale when the asset is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40
“Investment Property”. Hence this amendment introduces an exception to the existing
principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on investment
property measured at fair value. As a result of the amendments, SIC 21, “Income taxes —
recovery of revalued non-depreciable assets”, would no longer apply to investment properties
measured at fair value. As a result of the amendments, SIC 21, would no longer apply to
investment properties carried at fair value. The amendments also incorporate into IAS 12 the
remaining guidance previously contained in SIC 21, which is accordingly withdrawn.

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

This amendment has had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

- Amendment to IFRS 7, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”, on asset and liability offsetting.
This amendment includes new disclosures to facilitate comparison between those entities that
prepare IFRS financial statements to those that prepare financial statements in accordance with
US GAAP.

**_Impact of the amendment to IAS 19 on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of 31 December_**
**_2012_**

In accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”,
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” related adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2012 are
detailed as follows:

_Restatement of the consolidated statement of financial position:_

**Total equity and liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **630.4** **—** **630.4**

At 31 December 2012, the €9.2 million equity impact reflects the immediate recognition of
actuarial gains and losses through other comprehensive income and the elimination of the
option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the “corridor method”.

The Group will apply the above standards, amendment and interpretations on their respective
effective dates as endorsed by the European Union.

The Group did not exercise the option to adopt in advance these standards, amendments and
interpretations in the Interim Financial Statements as of and for the ten-month period ended
October 31, 2013 and does not expect that they would have a material impact on its results and
financial position.

**3.3. Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of Interim Financial Statements requires the Group to use judgments and make
estimates that can affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed frequently, and the effect of
changes in accounting estimates is accounted for from the date of revision.

In preparing these Interim Financial Statements, the significant judgments made by management
in applying the Group’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the
same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
31 December 2012.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty arising from the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial period could involve
a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA
plan for each Cash-Generating Units (CGU) defined by the Group. For the purposes of impairment
testing goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs most likely to benefit from the
synergies of the business combination and to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by

F-15

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

the Group. The CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or group of subsidiaries that are included in the
same operating segment and that generate cash-flows largely independent from those
generated by other CGUs. The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the
variability of the result following the changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there
is an indication of impairment, the Group carries out impairment tests. A valuation of the AD
brand is also performed separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is
reversible if events occur that show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer
exist.

In connection with the application of IFRS 8 “Segment Reporting” referred to above (See Note 7
“Segment Information”), the Group carried out a review of the value of goodwill and other nonfinancial assets as of October 31, 2013. Following the review, the Group did not recognize any
impairment provision or reversal with the exception of the CGU in Poland (See below).

In addition, as of October 31, 2013, a sensitivity analysis in respect of the key assumptions
regarding the value in use was carried out for each of the CGU. The assumptions used by the
Group are the discount rate and EBITDA, The results of the sensitivity analysis are as follows:

- A 100 basis points increase in the discount rate would lower the recoverable amount but no
impairment would be recognized by the Group;

- A 10% reduction in the EBITDA would lower the recoverable amount but no impairment
would be recognized by the Group.

At 31 December 2012, goodwill, tangible and property, plant and equipment of Poland CGU
were fully impaired. At 31 October 2013, the Group assessed that, considering the strong
recovery following the new management initiatives, there was an indication of impairment
reversal on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and therefore carried out a
valuation of their value in use, based on discounted cash flows taking into account the
components of the Group’s 2014 budget and the five-year business plan for AD Polska approved
by the Executive Committee. Following this valuation, an impairment reversal of €2.9 million on
property, plant and equipment and intangible asset was therefore recorded in “Other income
from operations”.

The amount of reversal was limited such that the carrying amount of the assets after reversal
does not exceed the amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognized in prior periods.

**_Income tax rate_**

In the preparation of these Interim Financial Statements and in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”, the Group applied a projected income tax rate based on the best estimate
of the weighted average annual income tax expected for the full financial year ended
31 December 2013.

#### 4. Financial risk management and financial instruments

**4.1. Financial risk factors**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including cash flow
interest rate risks, foreign exchange risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Interim Financial
Statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in
the annual financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual
financial statements as at 31 December 2012. There have been no changes in the risk
management or in any risk management policies since the year end.

**4.2. Fair value estimation**

The table in Note 19 “Presentation of financial assets and liabilities” analyses financial
instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as
follows:

- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

- Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is
unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

#### 5. Seasonality of operations

Due to the seasonal nature of the Group operations, lower revenue is usually expected in the
month of August and December of each year.

#### 6. Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 24 and the amount of goodwill in Note 10.

**6.1. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the ten-month period ended 31 October 2013**

**6.2. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the ten-month period ended 31 October 2012**

**_6.2.1. Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

**_Autodistribution’s acquisition of additional shares in the Enssemble group_**

On 9 July 2012, the Group acquired 80% of the Enssemble group thereby increasing its interest
from 20% to 100%.

The Enssemble group, located in the Lyon area in France, consists of the following eight
companies, all wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Enssemble holding company:

- Porteret and Gobillot

- Bugisy

- SCI Lorat

- SCI Synimalau

- SARL Auto Contrôle

- EURL PAPL

- SARL FRA

The above-mentioned entities have been consolidated using the full consolidation method as of
9 July 2012, the date on which control was obtained. Before this acquisition, the Enssemble
group was consolidated using the equity method.

The price paid in connection with the acquisition was € 10.4 million. In the four months to
31 October 2012, the Enssemble group contributed of €20.5 million to the Group’s revenues. The
PHF Group’s revenues and net income if Enssemble group had been consolidated over 10 months
are not presented in this report. The fact that the reporting date was not 31 December makes the
calculation impracticable. At 31 October 2013, the Enssemble group employed approximately 458
employees.

The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value at the acquisition
date were as follows:

Independent experts valued the property, plant and equipment enabling the fair value to be
assessed at the acquisition date. In accordance with the Group’s principles described in Note
3.3.11 of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, a
proportion of discounts, rebates, refunds and allowances granted to suppliers and the
transportation costs for purchases were added back to the value of inventories. Inventories and
trade receivables were impaired in accordance with the Group’s current methods. Inventory
reevaluation was based on the analysis of inventory rotation as well as level of provision. In

addition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Group recognized contingent liabilities
for €1.1 million related to provision for compliance work at sites and provision for tax risks. The
provision for tax risks was covered by a vendor’s liability guarantee which had been recognized.

The goodwill arising from the provisional allocation of the purchase price was €2.6 million. It
reflected the consolidation of the Group’s foothold in the Rhône-Alpes region where Enssemble
is the market leader, as well as future organization synergies. Goodwill was calculated as follows:

During the first six months of fiscal year 2013, the Group completed the allocation of the
purchase price, which resulted in a reevaluation of Enssemble’s inventories. Such inventory
reevaluation is primarily due to the completion of our analysis on inventory rotation. The impacts

#### 20. Borrowings and debt

**20.1. Group financing**

For the ten-month period ended 31 October 2013, Group financing can be broken down as
follows: The Group has four interest-free loans:


**Variable**
**interest**
**rate**


**Fair value at**
**31 Oct. 2013**
**(in € million)**


**Value at**
**amortised**
**costs at 31**
**Oct. 2013**
**(in € million)**


**Margin on**
**variable**
**interest**
**rate** **Maturity** **Comments**


**Type of borrowings**
**and debt**


**Nominal**
**value**
**(in € million)**


PH free shareholder
loan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50.0 44.6 44.6 — — April 2060 Fully underwritten
Sup Bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . 25.5 10.4 — — April 2017 Fully underwritten
EP bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.6 2.3 2.3 — — April 2017 Fully underwritten
Promissory note . . . . . . . 5.0 4.5 4.5 — — April 2017 Fully underwritten

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **83.1** **61.8** **51.4**

In accordance with IAS 32 “Financial instruments: presentation” and IAS 39 “Financial
instruments: recognition and measurement”, the interest-free loans have been discounted since
2009 with a repayment assumption in April 2014. At 31 December 2012, this assumption was
extended to April 2017 generating a change in fair value of €10.0 million recorded in equity as
the transaction was between shareholders.

On April 1 2009 the Group issued 25,500,000 subordinated bonds (“Sup Bonds”) which are
contingent value instruments with a nominal value of 1€ each in a total principal amount of
25.5 million. Sup Bonds do not bear interest and expire on April 21, 2017.

The Sup Bonds are payable only in the event of distributions of the Group that would result in
Towerbook, Investcorp and their respective affiliates (the “Group shareholders”) receiving more
than three times their aggregate investment between the issue date of these contingent value
instruments and the date of such distributions by April 21, 2017.

Such redemption shall be in an amount equal to a two-step portion of the excess amount
between the aggregate amount received by the Group shareholders and three times their
aggregate investment, up to a maximum amount equal, in any event, to their outstanding
principal amount (i.e. €25.5 millions).

As of 31 October, 2013, the Group carried out a review of the measurement of the Sup Bonds
based on current projections (Business plan and net debt) and related estimated equity value of
the Group. Following this review, the Group decreased the value of the Sup Bonds from
€22 million at 31 December 2012 to €10.4 million. As the measurement of this contingent value
instruments depends on unobservable inputs and on a range of projections that were not
previously available the related impact has been recorded through financial income of the ten
months ended October 31, 2013, as it was impracticable to allocate, as applicable, a portion of
such decrease in value to earlier periods.

The most sensitive assumptions relating to this fair value measurement are the timing of the
distributions to the Group shareholders considering the April 21, 2017 expiration of the Sup
Bonds and the impact of acquisitions / external growth on the projected EBITDA.

A 10% increase in EBITDA would increase the fair value of the Sup Bonds by €3.2 million. A 10%
decrease in EBITDA would decrease the fair value of the Sup Bonds by €5.4 million.

Moreover, no directors’ fees have been paid or are due to be paid in respect of the ten-month
period ended 31 October 2013.

#### 27. Commitments

The Group commitments are the same as those disclosed in the annual consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.

It shall be noted, that the Group has not recorded any provision relating to Klarius France as
management and its advisors are still considering that, in view of the facts of the case, there is
still currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources. For information, Klarius France, a
manufacturer of automobile spare parts in France, sued, in collective proceedings,
Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the French Commercial Court (Tribunal de
Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is
approximately €2.4 million.

#### 28. Events after the end of the reporting period

**28.1. Refinancing**

In connection with the proposed international offering and listing of Autodis Secured Notes in
early 2014 referred to under Note 3.2 above, the Group may consider using a portion of the
proceeds from such offering for refinancing/early repayment of all or a portion of the following
indebtedness:

- The €82.9 million Refinancing term facility loan and corporate purposes term facility, due on
April 2016;

- The interest free €5.0 million promissory note issued by the Group, due on 21 April 2017 (the
“Hedge Promissory Note”);

- The interest free €2.6 million equity purchase bonds without warrant attached issued by the
Group due on 21 April 2017 (The “EP Bonds”);

- The €9.3 million Senior equity loan due in 21 April 2018; and

- The €50.0 million unsecured shareholders loan provided by PHF BV to the Group, due on
21 April 2060 (The “Interest Free Shareholder Loan”)

Assuming a 100% early repayment of such financing as of 31 January 2014, the estimated related
extinguishment of debt impact to be recorded would be € 5.8 million.

**28.2. Acquisition in progress**

The Group has recently made an outstanding offer to acquire the control of ACR Holding and has
completed the acquisition of Rougon Queyrel for a provisional price of €7.6 million on 30
December 2013, both operating in the retail of automotive spare parts. Such acquisitions would
impact, as applicable, the early retirement of certain non-current borrowings referred to under
“Refinancing” above.

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your articles of association and by a
collective decision of the shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
December 31, 2012, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France);

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

#### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2012 and of the results of
its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

#### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de
commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the
following matter(s):

- In the context of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods applied by your
company, we have ensured that the accounting rules and methods relating to business
combinations, deferred taxes, pensions and other post-employment benefits, and inventory
impairment, as described respectively in the notes 3.3.8, 3.3.19b), 3.3.15b) and 3.3.11 to the
consolidated financial statements, are appropriate and were applied consistently. In the case
estimates need to be performed for their implementation, our procedures consisted in
assessing the data and assumptions on which these estimates were based, and the
reasonableness of the resulting valuations.

- The group performs systematically, at the end of each reporting period, impairment tests of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and also assesses whether an

F-42


-----

indication of impairment of other non-current assets exists, following the methodology
described in the notes 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 to the consolidated financial statements. We have
reviewed the soundness of the chosen approach and the assumptions used for these
impairment tests and we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of the calculations
made by the group in that respect. We have also ensured that the information given in the
notes 3.2.1, 3.3.7, 3.3.8b), 6.5, 6.6, 8.1 and 8.2 to the consolidated financial statements is
appropriate.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

#### III. Specific verification

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in
France the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

#### 1 Approval of the financial statements

On 29 March 2013, the Chairman approved Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S.’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2012. Parts Holdings (France) is a simplified jointstock company (société par actions simplifiée — S.A.S.) with a sole shareholder. It was
incorporated on 18 January 2006.

The shareholder is Parts Holdings BV, which in turn is owned by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A.

The Parts Holdings (France) Group specialises in the distribution of automotive spare parts. The
Group’s activities focus on two areas: Light Vehicles (LV) and Heavy Vehicles (HV).

#### 2 Information relating to the parent company

Parts Holdings (France)

A simplified joint-stock company with capital of €152,598,261.00

Registered office: 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France

Registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165.

Parts Holdings (France) and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements
of Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A., a company incorporated under Dutch law and registered with
the Dutch Trade and Companies Registry under number 30254923, having its registered office at
Schiphol Boulevard 329, 1118 BJ Luchthaven, Schiphol, Netherlands.

#### 3 Accounting rules and methods

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S. and all its subsidiaries (the
“Group”) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2012 and available on the following
website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (€m) unless stated otherwise.

**3.1** **Basis of preparation**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011, with the exception of
the adoption of the amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Transfer of Financial Assets, applicable
to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.

The adoption of said amendment has had no impact on the company’s financial statements.

The Group has not opted for the early application of:

- Amendment to IAS 19 — Employee Benefits, applicable to accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2013 and adopted by the European Union on 5 June 2012.

The main changes that will have an impact on the provision for post-employment benefits are as
follows:

- Discontinuation of the corridor method that the Group has used until now: the actuarial gains
and losses created during the period must be recorded in other comprehensive income and will
no longer be amortised in the consolidated income statement over employees’ remaining
service period;

- Immediate recognition in income of the effect of plan amendments (e.g., amendment of
collective bargaining agreement), which are no longer recognised on a straight-line basis over
the remaining service period;

F-52


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- Alignment of the expected return on plan assets rate with the yield from high quality bonds
used for the calculation of the present value of the obligation;

- Accumulated unrecognized past service costs and actuarial gains and losses at the beginning of
the first comparative period shown must be recorded in reserves.

The year 2012 reporting period must also be presented as restated in the 2013 financial
statements (see Note 3.3.15 b).

- Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of items of net income, gains and losses recorded directly
in equity, applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.

Moreover, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendment adopted by the
European Union and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29 December
2012:

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments – recognition and measurement, applicable on or after
1 January 2015;

- IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 13 — Fair Value Measurement, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January
2013;

- IAS 28 — Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- Amendment to IAS 12 — Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, applicable on or after
1 January 2012.

The Group will apply said standards and amendment on their respective effective dates.

Finally, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendment, which the European
Union had not adopted as of 31 December 2012:

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time
Adopters, applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011;

- Amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or
after 1 January 2013;

- Amendment to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or after
1 January 2014;

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — Government Loans, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- Amendments relating to transitional provisions for IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, applicable on
or after 1 January 2013;

- Annual improvements — 2009-2011 cycle for amendments applicable on or after 1 January
2013. Said improvements relate to:

  - IFRS 1, which explains:

       - repeated applications of IFRS 1

       - borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date
for capitalisation precedes the date of transition to IFRSs;

  - IAS 1, which clarifies the requirements for comparative information;

  - IAS 16, which provides a classification of servicing equipment;

F-53


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IAS 32, which explains the tax effect relating to distributions to holders of equity
instruments and to the costs relating to equity transactions;

  - IAS 34, which clarifies interim financial reporting and segment information for the total
assets in a segment.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and interpretations in order to measure their
potential impact on the results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess the
impact on disclosures.

**3.2** **Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty connected to the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial year could involve a
significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an
indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are subject to an impairment test when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows taking into
account the components of the Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan approved
by the Executive Committee.

The impairment test on cash-generating units (CGU) is based on the four-year EBIDTA plan. The
assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following
the amendment of all assumptions.

Historically, the impairment test performed on the France CGU resulted in recording a goodwill
impairment loss of €368.5 million and a €150.4 million impairment loss for the AD brand in 2008.

Each year, the Group carries out impairment tests on the France CGU, which includes the AD
brand, and the Poland CGU. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed separately, bearing in
mind that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that show that the indicators
that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of the acquisition, is included in the France
CGU. At 31 December 2010, the gross value of the AD brand stood at €156.9 million in the
consolidated financial statements and its net value at €17.1 million. Following a valuation carried
out by an independent external firm and in conjunction with the impairment test on the France
CGU, the value of the brand had decreased to €135 million in the consolidated accounts at
31 December 2011. An impairment reversal of €117.9 million was therefore recorded for the year.

In 2012, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). It is based on revenue generated over five
years by the AD brand, i.e., by the PHF Group’s subsidiaries or the affiliated distributors. The
assumptions used include a discount rate of 11.2%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity
growth rate of 1%.

F-54


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

This valuation shows a brand value of €142 million, i.e., €7 million more than in 2011. This
increase can be largely explained by the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.7% in
2011 and 11.2% in 2012 owing to the change of the weighted average cost of capital, whereas
the assumptions relating to increase in revenue were relatively stable.

Accordingly, by way of caution in a difficult and uncertain market, no impairment reversal was
recorded at 31 December 2012 and the value of the AD brand remained at €135 million.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation in relation to discount and royalty rate
assumptions.

**1.50%** **144** **142** **132**

**2.00%** **193** **189** **176**

**_France CGU_**

At 31 December 2012, the assets tested, including goodwill and the AD brand, stood at
€313 million. The assets tested are compared with the value in use which is calculated using a
valuation based on future cash flows discounted at 9.5% and with a perpetuity growth rate of
1%, i.e., €368 million. A sensitivity calculation was performed that shows that the valuation
would amount to €331 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at
90%, i.e., higher than the value of the net assets tested. Accordingly, no asset impairment was
recorded.

100% 416 390 368 348 337 320

**_Poland CGU_**

At 31 December 2011, goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were fully
impaired.

At 31 December 2012, the value in use stood at €1.5 million (valuation based on discounted cash
flows at the rate of 10.5% with a perpetuity growth rate of 1%). Accordingly, no reversal is to be
recorded for the year. However, an additional allowance of €0.3 million corresponding to the
increase in the gross value of assets for the year was recorded.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.3.8.

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The
calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to
estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable
profits, with regard to tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2011, the Group began to recognise deferred tax assets calculated on the basis
of the three-year business plan. At 31 December 2012, the recognised deferred tax assets were
calculated on the basis of the Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan. Further
details are provided in Notes 3.3.19 and 6.9.2.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions as regards discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates. The net liability in respect of these employee
benefits at 31 December 2012 stood at €25.5 million. Further details are provided in Note 22.
There are no other post-employment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2012 totalled €19.9 million.

**3.3** **Summary of the main accounting methods**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reference period as those of the parent company, applying
homogeneous accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets, and which are generated by internal
transactions, are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group took control of them, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such
control. The financial statements of the companies over which the Group has significant
influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, they are shown separately from the share attributable to owners of the
parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its accounts.

The financial statements of entities that use a different functional currency from the euro are
translated as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate on the reporting date.

- Income statement and statement of cash flows items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from said conversion are allocated directly to a separate
line item under equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of
deferred foreign exchange gains or losses shown in the separate item of equity and relating to
said foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.

F-56


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the euro are
located in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on the transaction date. On the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Replacement costs are included in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment if
the accounting criteria are met.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds of
disposal of said asset and its carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in
which it is derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method in
accordance with the following periods of use:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified, if
necessary, on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at their purchase cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
for IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised in accordance with their economic useful life and are subject to
an impairment test whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The

F-57


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least on the reporting date every year. Any change to the projected useful life or projected rate
of consumption of the representative future economic benefits of the asset is recorded by
changing the amortisation period or method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated
as changes in estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s
function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category, and comprise, primarily, software licences for
Movex accounting software.

These fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following
estimated period of useful life:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These fixed assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either
individually or at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the intangible asset belongs. The
useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If not, the
change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded
prospectively.

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of acquisition, is attached to the cash
generating unit consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries (France CGU).

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement on its commencement date. This requires assessing whether performance of the
agreement depends on the use of a specific asset or specific assets, and whether the agreement
grants a right to use the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, the
commencement date is deemed to be 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the term of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if it is lower, at the discounted value
of the minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are broken down
between the financial expense and the amortisation of the debt so as to obtain a constant
periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The financial expenses are
recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets that are subject to a finance lease are amortised over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the asset
when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2012, the Group has finance leases in the capacity of lessee (see Notes 29.1 and
29.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred when

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded over
the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is recorded
as income from ordinary activities over the period in which it is acquired.

At 31 December 2012, the Group does not have any finance leases in the capacity of lessor.

**_3.3.6 Non-current held-for-sale assets and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities is/are
presented separately in the statement of financial position when it is/they are significant,
without restatement of previous periods. The assets or group of assets are measured at the lower
of their carrying amount and their estimated selling price less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operation for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held-for-sale assets or it must form part of an overall plan to sell an
operation or a significant geographical area for the Group; or, finally, it must be a significant
subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. The components of the income statement
and statement of cash flows relating to said discontinued operations are presented separately in
the financial statements for all the periods presented if they are significant. The components of
the statement of financial position relating to previous years are not presented separately; only
the components of the last period shown are classified as assets and liabilities discontinued.

At 31 December 2011, the Group did not have any discontinued operations.

In 2012, strategies for alliance or disposal of Italian operations were examined as Italy’s results
were disappointing and prospects for growth limited. At PH Coöperatief’s Board Meeting on
5 July 2012, it was officially decided to enter into discussions with a view to disposing of said
operations. Negotiations opened with GIADI, an independent Italian distributor, resulted in a
framework agreement signed by the parties on 19 December 2012. The agreement provides for
the sale of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italy (PHI) owned by Autodis to GIADI in the first
quarter of 2013, subject to the consent of both entities’ Boards of Directors.

At the end of December 2012, Italy is therefore deemed to be a held-for-sale asset in accordance
with IFRS 5. Moreover, since Italy is a CGU for the Group and a major geographical area, and as
the Group only operates in three countries, the result of the Italian operations is presented
separately in the income statement under discontinued operations (see Note 5).

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, individually or at the level of
the cash-generating unit to which they are attached.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on other assets or groups of assets. If the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is deemed to have lost
some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. Value in use is
determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

F-59


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the level of its recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation or amortisation, if no
impairment had been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss
reversal is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the revised IFRS
3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of the
acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at fair value on the acquisition date, which takes
into account all the probabilities of occurrence. Considerations are classified as debt or equity
according to their nature, those classified as debts are then remeasured at fair value and the
difference recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date, with the
exception of non-current assets classified as held-for-sale assets, which are recorded at fair value
less disposal costs, and other assets and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with
the applicable standards.

Goodwill represents any excess in the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, the value of the non-controlling interests over the net fair value of the acquired
company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a
period of twelve months of the acquisition date. After said time, the effects are recorded directly
in the income statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGU_

Goodwill acquired when businesses are combined is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered by their use or by selling
them.

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for
the difference between both amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit or
group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
inflows that are primarily independent from cash inflows generated by other groups of assets.

An analysis of the segmentation of the Group into CGUs resulted in deeming the following as
CGUs:

- the perimeter consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries

F-60


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- the perimeter consisting of AD Polska and its subsidiary

- the perimeter consisting of Parts Holdings Italia and its subsidiary (see Note 5 on the
discontinued assets).

_Assessment of recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the net fair
value of the disposal costs or value in use, whichever is higher.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to projected discounted future cash flows
from said assets, in light of economic assumptions and the Group management’s projected
operating requirements.

An impairment loss recorded on goodwill cannot be reversed because of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Depending on the type of instrument, financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are
classified as financial assets at fair value through income, as loans and receivables, as held-tomaturity investments or as financial assets available for sale. On initial recognition, financial
assets are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (except for the
category of financial assets measured at fair value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets when they are initially recognised in
the accounts and, when it is authorised and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each
annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets measured at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income statement includes financial assets
acquired with a view to resale in the short term.

Duly designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2012, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and a fixed maturity date that the Group obviously intends to hold and is able to hold
to maturity. After initially recording them in the accounts, held-to-maturity investments are
valued at amortised cost.

The gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are
derecognised or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2012, the Group did not own any financial assets recorded in the held-tomaturity investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After they have been initially recorded, loans and
receivables are valued at amortised cost applying the effective interest rate method less, where
appropriate, an amount for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any
initial premium or discount and includes fees that form an integral part of the effective interest
rate method as well as transaction costs.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the loans and receivables are
derecognised or are impaired using the amortised cost mechanism.

F-61


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2012) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income in a reserve for net
unrealised gains and losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accumulated profit or
loss previously recorded in equity is recycled in the income statement. The interest received or
paid on said investments is recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an asset market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other that does not correspond to quoted prices for
identical instruments;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market players would
have applied to value the asset’s other values.

All the fair value measurements are presented in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of impairment on loans and receivables recorded at amortised
cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the discounted value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate
calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by using an
impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the income
statement.

Regarding trade receivables, an impairment loss is recorded when there is an objective indication
(such as a probability that the debtor will become bankrupt or is in serious financial difficulties)
that the Group will not be able to recover the amount payable under the contractual terms of
the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account.
The impaired outstanding amounts are recorded as a loss when they are deemed nonrecoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost (less the repayment of
the principal and any amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.

F-62


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Impairment relating to equity instruments cannot be reversed inthe income statement.
Impairment losses relating to debt instruments are reversed in the income statement if the
increase in the instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after
the impairment loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
current year, taking into account an average stock rotation. The valuation of inventory also takes
into account the impact of discounts and allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well
as the transportation cost on purchases.

This method of inventory valuation is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of
the fast stock rotation.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price on the reporting date, less estimated selling
costs taking into account their technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to
slow rotation.

In the case the inventory shown in the statement of financial position of a company included in
the scope of consolidation derives from a purchase made from another entity that is a member of
the Group, the internal income recorded in the selling company’s accounts is neutralized.

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash in the
bank and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and investment
securities which meet the criteria of cash equivalent, i.e.:

- short-term investment;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash;

- insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Investment securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds with a negligible risk of
changes in value.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate. The issue costs have an impact on the entry value and are spread via the effective
interest rate method. The amortised issue costs are presented as a deduction from the debts to
which they relate.

The income (loss) is recorded in the income statement when the debts are derecognised and
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.3.14 Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

At 31 December 2012, the Group does not hold any hedging instruments.

F-63


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising
from a past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be necessary in order to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated.

When the Group expects partial or total reimbursement of the provision, for example from an
insurance policy, the reimbursement is recorded as a separate asset but only if the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is
recorded in the income statement net of any reimbursements.

If the effect of the time-value of money is significant, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the elapsing of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group belongs to basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on the
investment. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid that are recorded as an expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each employee of the Group receives a retirement
severance payment when he retires. This plan is very poorly pre-funded. An independent actuary
calculates the Group’s commitment under this plan annually using the projected unit credit
method. These calculations include actuarial assumptions concerning demographic mortality,
severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined with reference to the
yield from bonds issued by high-ranking companies. The actuarial gains and losses generated are
recognised in accordance with the corridor method. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

At 31 December 2012, the Group chose not to record actuarial gains and losses relating to
employee benefits directly in equity in accordance with the option available by IAS 19. The Group
still uses the “corridor” method.

According to IAS 19R, the application of which is mandatory from 1 January 2013 for
post-employment plans, actuarial gains and losses may no longer be recognised in the income
statement (via the corridor method). Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately
in equity. The impact of the application of the standard at 1 January 2013 is estimated to be
approximately €9.2 million.

**_3.3.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the

F-64


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

consideration received or to be received, to the exclusion of discounts and allowances and other
taxes on sales and customs duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in
order to recognise revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of goods.

_b) Rendering of services_

Transactions involving the rendering of services are recorded over the period in which the
services are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that accurately discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument so as to obtain the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment thereof is established.

**_3.3.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, personnel costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation
and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the effect of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.3.18 Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses relates to unusual events with significant amounts effects.

Other operating income can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and gains
on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other operating expenses can also include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as any cost relating to
past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.3.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and rules applied to determine said amounts are those that were enacted or substantially
enacted on the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), one of the components of which is the Company Value-Added_
Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed

F-65


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

the methods for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national
accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that, in the
particular case, this contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This
contribution has therefore been classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements
since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the liability method for any timing differences on the reporting
date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the
statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be charged.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed on each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that a sufficient taxable profit will be available to enable all or
some of said deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profit will enable
them to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to be applied for the
year in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
that were enacted or substantially enacted on the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is an enforceable legal right to offset them
and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

#### 4 Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 26 and the amount of goodwill in Note 8.

**4.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2012**

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The above-mentioned entities have been consolidated using the full consolidation method as of
9 July 2012, the date on which control was obtained.

At 31 December 2011, the Enssemble group was consolidated using the equity method.

The price paid in connection with the acquisition was €10.4 million.

The Enssemble group generates annual revenue of approximately €65 million and employs
around 450 people. The revenue included in the Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements
covered a period of six months and amounts to €31.7 million with net income of €0.35 million.

The Enssemble group’s statutory financial statements were drawn up and audited by Eurex at
30 September.

The PHF group’s 2012 revenue and net income if Enssemble had been consolidated over
12 months are not presented in this report. The fact that the reporting date is not 31 December
makes the calculation impracticable.

The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value are as follows (in
millions of euros):

Independent experts valued the property, plant and equipment enabling the fair value to be
assessed at the acquisition date.

In accordance with the Group’s principles described in Note 3.3.11, a proportion of discounts,
rebates, refunds and allowances granted by suppliers and the transportation costs for purchases
were added back to the value of inventories.

Inventories and trade receivables were impaired in accordance with the Group’s current methods.

In addition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the following contingent liabilities were
recognised in the opening statement of financial position:

Provision for compliance work at the sites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 97k

The provision for tax risks is covered by a vendor’s liability guarantee which has been recognized.

The goodwill arising from the provisional allocation of the purchase price is €2.6 million (see
Note 8.1). It reflects the consolidation of the Group’s foothold in the Rhône Alpes region where
Enssemble is the market leader, as well as future organisational synergies.

Goodwill is calculated as follows (in millions of euros):

Acquisition price for 80% of the capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.4

includes all the remaining rent due until the lease expires in May 2017, including rental charges
and taxes. This provision is discounted at 4%. In 2012, the reversal of this provision, net of
amortisation of the €1.2 million discount, covered the expenses recorded for the year. At
31 December 2012, the balance of said provision stood at €6.3 million.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. Tax losses carryforwards of this tax
consolidation group were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in the
expanded base in 2012.

Moreover, there is a tax consolidation group in France whose parent company is Parts Holdings
(France) and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the
expanded tax base (previously consolidated in Autodis).

In 2012, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for offsetting
tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million plus 50% of
the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

The taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of
the tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the PHF tax consolidation
group in which the available 50% loss relief of tax-loss carryforwards also applies.

A tax planning exercise for the operations in France was carried out on the basis of the 2013
Group budget and a three-year business plan for France in order to determine the future use of
loss carryforwards in light of current loss relief rules so as to assess the deferred tax asset to be
recognised in the accounts at 31 December 2012.

This tax planning shows €85.6 million in tax loss carryforwards would be used, i.e., a tax saving of
€30.0 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of
the plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was limited to this
amount.

At 31 December 2012, the loss carryforwards, after allocating €12.7 million to 2012, stood at
€257 million for the expanded base and €283 million for the PHF tax consolidation group.

Moreover, the deferred tax asset on the AD brand was adjusted at 31 December 2012 owing to
the change to the limits for offsetting the losses described above.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments presenting a
long-term prospect of reversing. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the
Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to
record any deferred tax asset after said period, except as a deduction from deferred tax liabilities
identified at the year end.

The Group has four interest-free loans:

**Value at**

**Fair value** **amortised** **Margin on**

**Nominal** **at 31 Dec.** **cost at** **Variable** **variable**

**Type of borrowings and** **value** **2012** **31 Dec. 2012** **interest** **interest**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **83.1** **71.8** **71.8** **—** **—**

In accordance with IAS 32/39, the interest-free loans have been discounted since 2009 with a
repayment assumption in April 2013. This assumption was extended to April 2017 generating a
change in fair value and recorded in equity at €10.0 million as the transaction was between
shareholders.

Other means of financing are listed below:

**Interest** **Margin on**

**Nominal** **eligible for** **Variable** **variable**

**Type of borrowings and** **value** **Value** **capitalisation —** **interest** **interest**

(1) 1, 2, 3, or 6-month Euribor depending on the term of the drawdown period.

As in 2011, €15.0 million was repaid in advance of term on the above borrowings on 30 June
2012. This repayment broke down as follows:

**Early repayment**

#### 21 Management objectives and policies for financial risks

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
key objective of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risks,
foreign exchange risks, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. These policies are summarised below.

Moreover, the Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise the debt to capital ratios
and the financial leverage obtained by debt.

**21.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk for this portion of the debt.

The Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap in January 2010 in
order to limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The cap expired on 31 December 2012.
The Group did not wish to take out further hedges in light of current market conditions.

**21.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles described in
Note 3.3.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2012. No specific hedges were taken out for this exchange
risk.

**21.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group only has commercial relationships with third parties that are financially healthy. The
Group’s policy is to verify the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment credit
terms. Moreover, customer balances are continually monitored and, accordingly, the Group’s
exposure to bad debt is not material.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the relevant third parties with a maximum exposure
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

**21.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012. Failure to comply with these
covenants may result in early repayment of credit lines (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA,

- Cash flow/servicing of the debt.

The thresholds to be complied with for the “net borrowings/proforma EBITDA” ratio are as
follows:

Payment due date 30 June 2012 — ratio below 3.25

Payment due date 30 September 2012 — ratio below 3.00

Payment due date 31 December 2012 — ratio below 2.75

Payment due date 31 March 2013 — ratio below 2.50

Payment due date 31 December 2013 — ratio below 2.25

Payment due date 30 June 2014 — ratio below 2.10

Payment due date 30 September 2014 — ratio below 2.00

The “Cash flow/servicing of the debt” ratio must be above 1 at each maturity.

The Group has calculated and complied with these ratios since 30 June 2012.

**21.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

**22.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
assumptions made for the valuations of the referenced periods are as follows:

**2012** **2011**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.80% 4.18% 4.30% 5.80%
Assumption relating to long-term
changes in the number of employees
Employees — supervisors . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50%/year 3.50%/year 2.50%/year 3.50%/year
Managerial staff . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%/year 4.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They include both the “gender”
factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment grade
bonds.

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating
to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In these cases, in conjunction with its legal
advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the dispute and assesses the probability of an
outflow of resources.

In 2012, the provision for risks relating to the terms of the sale of AD Rhône to Mr Gobillot in
2004 was extinguished at Group level following the acquisition of the Enssemble group, which
includes AD Rhône.

The balance of €1.5 million listed under “Business Combinations” corresponds to the provisions
recorded at the time of the provisional purchase price allocation for the Enssemble group. These
provisions are mostly offset by a vendor’s liability guarantee in the amount of €1.1 million.

(*) The reversal of the provision for site closures at Logisteo amounts to €1.5 million, less a discounting adjustment of €0.3 million.

**24.2 Non-current provisions**

Movement in non-current provisions were as follows:

**Reversals** **Reversals**

**1 Jan.** **Business** **Reclassif-** **(used** **(surplus** **Total** **31 Dec.**

Cramayel, explained in Note 6.6.

**_Relationship with the shareholder_**

The sole shareholder of Parts Holdings (France) is Parts Holdings BV.

Parts Holdings BV, which is owned by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A., finances the Group via the
following loans: PH free shareholder loan and PH senior equity loan described in Note 20.1.

The Group pays management fees of €0.14 million per quarter to Parts Holdings Coop and
€0.01 million per quarter to Parts Holdings BV.

#### 28 Management compensation

The key management personnel of a group within the meaning of IAS 24 are those persons
having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the
entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that
entity.

The Group’s key management personnel are the members of the Executive Committee, directors,
area managers and general brand managers. The amounts reported in the 2011 annual report
included only directors and members of the Executive Committee. They were therefore adjusted

2006 and amended on 21 April 2009, was signed for a maximum amount of €107.4 million in
trade receivables.

At 31 December 2012, no assignment of receivables as security is in progress.

_Bank covenants (see Note 21.4)_

The bank agreement signed with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to
compliance with the bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012 following the
takeover of the Parts Holdings Group (France). Failure to comply with said covenants could result
in the early repayment of financing lines.

**_29.3.2 Other Group guarantees_**

Bank overdrafts in Poland are secured by:

  - pledges of inventory for a total value of €17.7 million,

  - pledges of non-current assets for a total value of €2.0 million.

Enssemble bank overdrafts are secured (HSBC bank) by pledged business assets.

Moreover, the Group must comply with the following covenants for HSBC:

       - equity/total assets > 20%

F-94

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

       - total M/LT debt/equity < 1

       - total M/LT debt/ self financing capacity (“Capacité d’autofinancement”)< 4

In addition, an agreement was signed with the supplier Akzo Nobel in June 2012 in which
Autodistribution undertakes to make a total number purchases of at least €55 million until 2019.

**29.4 Individual training entitlement**

The balance of the number of unused hours at 31 December 2012 was 429,464. The number of
hours accrued over the year was 79,937 and 10,677 hours were used.

**29.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automobile spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the French Commercial Court (Tribunal
_de Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim_
is approximately €2.4 million. No provision was created in Group’s accounts as of 31 December
2012 as management and its advisors considered that, in view of the facts of the case, there is
currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources.

#### 30 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 1 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Group Freinage Poids Lourds
Services, which consists of 17 entities located in western France.

On 31 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Rectification, in the northern
French department Pas de Calais, as well as its subsidiary Lilcolor.

Since these companies had not closed their financial statements at 31 December 2012 and the
Group had not allocated the purchase price, there are no related disclosures in this report.

The disposal of 80% of PHI’s shares by Autodis to Giadi was approved by Giadi’s Board of
Directors on 10 January 2013 and Autodis’s Board of Directors on 14 January 2013.

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your articles of association and by a
collective decision of the shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
December 31, 2011, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France);

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

#### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the group as at December 31, 2011 and of the results of
its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

#### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the_
following matters:

- In the context of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods applied by your
company, we have ensured that the accounting rules and methods relating to business
combinations, deferred taxes, pensions and other post-employment benefits, and inventory
impairment, as described respectively in the notes 3.3.8, 3.3.19b), 3.3.15b) and 3.3.11 to the
consolidated financial statements, are appropriate and were applied consistently. In the case
estimates need to be performed for their implementation, our procedures consisted in
assessing the data and assumptions on which these estimates were based, and the
reasonableness of the resulting valuations.

- The group performs systematically, at the end of each reporting period, impairment tests of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and also assesses whether an

F-98


-----

indication of impairment of other non-current assets exists, following the methodology
described in the notes 3.3.7 and 3.3.8b) to the consolidated financial statements. We have
reviewed the soundness of the chosen approach and the assumptions used for these
impairment tests and we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of the calculations
made by the group in that respect. We have also ensured that the information given in the
notes 3.2.1, 3.3.7, 3.3.8b), 6.5, 6.6, 8.1 and 8.2 to the consolidated financial statements is
appropriate.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

#### III. Specific verification

As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in
France, the information presented in the group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

the Dutch Trade and Companies Registry under number 30254923, having its registered office at
Schiphol Boulevard 329, 1118 BJ Luchthaven, Schiphol, Netherlands.

#### 3 Accounting rules and methods

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S. and all its subsidiaries (the
“Group”) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2011 and available on the following
website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (€m) unless stated otherwise.

**3.1** **Basis of preparation**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010, with the exception of
the adoption of the following new standards and interpretations:

- IFRIC 19 — Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments;

- Amendments to interpretation IFRIC 14 — Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement;

- IAS 24 — Related Party Disclosures (as revised in 2009);

- Amendment to IAS 32 — Classification of Rights Issues;

- Improvements to IRFSs published in May 2010 for the amendments applicable to annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. These improvements concern:

  - IAS 1, which clarifies the provisions relating to the statement of changes in equity, stating
that the analysis of other comprehensive income must be provided for each component of
equity — either in the statement of changes in equity itself, or in the notes. This
amendment is applied retrospectively,

F-108


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IFRIC 13, which clarifies items to be taken into account to measure the fair value of
customer loyalty programmes. This amendment is applied retrospectively,

  - IAS 34, which states that the information provided is an update on the information
reported in the latest set of annual financial statements,

  - IFRS 7 relating to credit risk, which requires a description of collateral and other credit
enhancement mechanisms without setting over-collateralised and under-collateralised
loans,

  - The following amendments to IFRS 3R were applied from 1 July 2010: (i) the limitation of
the fair value option in the measurement of non-controlling interests during a business
combination (ii) the application of previous IFRS 3 provisions to earn-out clauses
concerning business combinations accounted for under IFRS 3 and (iii) the clarification on
accounting for unreplaced and voluntarily replaced share option plans of the acquiree.

The adoption of these standards and interpretations has had no impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

The Group has not applied the amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Transfers of Financial Assets,
applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 and adopted by the European
Union in November 2011.

Moreover, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendments, which the
European Union had not adopted as of 31 December 2011:

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments — Recognition and Measurement, applicable on or after
1 January 2015;

- IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IFRS 13 — Fair Value Measurement, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January
2013;

- IAS 28 — Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- Amendment to IAS 12 — Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, applicable on or after
1 January 2012;

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time
Adopters, applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011;

- Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of terms of net income, gains and losses recorded directly
in equity, applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012;

- Amendment to IAS 19 — Employee Benefits;

- Amendment to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or after
1 January 2014;

- Amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or
after 1 January 2013.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and interpretations in order to measure their
potential impact on the results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess the
impact on disclosures.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

With respect to the amendment to IAS 19, the key modifications that will impact the provision
for post-employment benefits are as follows:

  - Discontinuation of the corridor method: the actuarial gains and losses created during the
period must be recorded in other comprehensive income and no longer in the income
statement, as is currently the case in accordance with the corridor method;

  - Immediate recognition in income of the effect of plans amendments (e.g., amendment of
collective bargaining agreement), which is no longer recognised on a straight-line basis
over the remaining service period;

  - Accumulated past service costs and actuarial gains and losses at the beginning of the first
comparative period shown must be recorded in reserves.

The 2012 reporting period must also be presented as restated.

**3.2 Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty connected to the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial year could involve a
significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an
indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are subject to an impairment test when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of the assets was calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows taking
into account the components of the three-year business plan approved by the Executive
Committee.

The impairment test on goodwill is based on the three-year EBIDTA plan. The assumptions used
then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following the amendment of
all assumptions.

The impairment test performed on goodwill and the AD brand resulted in recording an
impairment loss of €368.5 million and €150.4 million respectively in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, the
impairment test did not result in the recognition of additional impairment or the reversal of
previously recognised impairment (reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited).

In 2011, impairment tests were performed on the France and Poland CGUs. The AD brand is
included in the France CGU. Its valuation therefore partly depends on that of the France CGU. A
valuation of the AD brand was carried out in 2011 by an independent external brand specialist.

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The conclusions from the analysis conducted by the independent external firm show the value in
use of the AD brand to be between €135 million and €180 million depending on the assumptions
used. The gross value in the consolidated financial statements stood at €156.9 million while the
net value amounted to €17.1 million. Following the impairment test for the France CGU, the
brand’s value was written down to €135 million. An impairment reversal equal to €117.9 million
was therefore recorded in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2011.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The brand is valued using the revenue approach. This method is based on revenue generated
over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the PHF Group’s subsidiaries and affiliated distributors.
The assumptions used include a discount rate of 11.7%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity
growth rate of 1%.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation in relation to discount and royalty rate
assumptions.

2.00% **192** **180** **175**

**_France CGU_**

At 31 December 2011, consolidated net assets amounted to €299.4 million after an impairment
reversal on the AD brand, described in the above paragraph. The net assets are compared with a
valuation based on future cash flows discounted at 10% and with a perpetuity growth rate of
1%, i.e., €364 million. A sensitivity calculation was performed that shows that the valuation
would amount to €327 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at
90%, i.e., higher than the value of the net assets tested. Accordingly, no asset impairment was
recorded.

**100%** 409 385 364 352 334

**_Poland CGU_**

At 31 December 2011, consolidated net assets amounted to €18.6 million. The valuation based on
future cash flows discounted at 10.5% and with zero perpetuity growth amounted to
€7.7 million. Accordingly, goodwill, which had a carrying amount of €0.4 million, was fully
impaired. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were also fully impaired for
€3.5 million and €0.3 million respectively.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.3.8.

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The
calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to
estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable
profits, with regard to tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2011, the Group began to recognise deferred tax assets calculated on the basis
of the three-year business plan. Further details are provided in Notes 3.3.19 and 6.9.2.

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions as regards discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates. The net liability in respect of these employee
benefits at 31 December 2011 stood at €25.3 million. Further details are provided in Note 22.
There are no other post-employment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale. Inventory
impairment rates are reviewed periodically.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2011 totalled €17.5 million.

**3.3** **Summary of the main accounting methods**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reference period as those of the parent company, applying
homogeneous accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets, and which are generated by internal
transactions, are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group took control of them, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such
control, in accordance with the following methods:

- Full consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
companies directly or indirectly controlled by the parent company or its subsidiaries.

- Equity method: the financial statements of companies over which the Group has significant
influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, they are shown separately from the share attributable to owners of the
parent.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its accounts.

The financial statements of entities that use a different functional currency from the euro are
translated as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate on the reporting date.

- Income statement and statement of cash flows items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from said conversion are allocated directly to a separate
line item under equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of
deferred foreign exchange gains or losses shown in the separate item of equity and relating to
said foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the euro are
located in Poland (currency: zloty).

F-112

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on the transaction date. On the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on that date. All differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Replacement costs are included in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment if
the accounting criteria are met.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds of
disposal of said asset and its carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in
which it is derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method in
accordance with the following periods of use:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
IT equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 years
Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The residual values, useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and
modified, if necessary, on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at their purchase cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
for IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised in accordance with their economic useful life and are subject to
an impairment test whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The
amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least on the reporting date every year. Any change to the projected useful life or projected rate

F-113


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

of consumption of the representative future economic benefits of the asset is recorded by
changing the amortisation period or method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated
as changes in estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s
function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category, and comprise, primarily, software licences for
Movex accounting software.

These fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following
estimated period of useful life:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These fixed assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either
individually or at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the intangible asset belongs. The
useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If not, the
change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded
prospectively.

Gains or losses arising on the derecognition of intangible assets are equal to the difference
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the asset. They are recorded
in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of acquisition, is attached to the cash
generating unit consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries (France CGU).

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement on its commencement date. This requires assessing whether performance of the
agreement depends on the use of a specific asset or specific assets, and whether the agreement
grants a right to use the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, the
commencement date is deemed to be 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the term of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if it is lower, at the discounted value
of the minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are broken down
between the financial expense and the amortisation of the debt so as to obtain a constant
periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The financial expense are
recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets that are subject to a finance lease are amortised over either the shorter of the lease term
and its useful life, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the
asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2011, the Group has finance leases in the capacity of lessee (see Notes 29.1 and
29.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred when

F-114


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded over
the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is recorded
as income from ordinary activities over the period in which it is acquired.

At 31 December 2011, the Group does not have any finance leases in the capacity of lessor.

**_3.3.6 Non-current held-for-sale assets and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities is/are
presented separately in the statement of financial position when it is/they are significant,
without restatement of previous periods. The assets or group of assets are measured at the lower
of their carrying amount and their estimated selling price, whichever is the lower, less costs to
sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operation for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held-for-sale assets or it must form part of an overall plan to sell an
operation or a significant geographical area for the Group; or, finally, it must be a significant
subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. The components of the income statement
and statement of cash flows relating to said discontinued operations are presented separately in
the financial statements for all the periods presented if they are significant. The components of
the statement of financial position relating to previous years are not presented separately; only
the components of the last period shown are classified as assets and liabilities for discontinued.

There were no discontinued operations at 31 December 2010 or 31 December 2011 (see Note 5).

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, individually or at the level of
the cash-generating unit to which they are attached.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on other assets or group of assets. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is deemed to have lost some of its
value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. Value in use is determined on
the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by applying a discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An
appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the level of its recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, if no
impairment had been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss
reversal is recorded in the income statement.

F-115

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at fair value on the acquisition date, which takes
into account all the probabilities of occurrence. Considerations are classified as debt or equity
according to their nature, those classified as debts are then remeasured at fair value and the
difference recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date, with the
exception of non-current assets classified as held-for-sale assets, which are recorded at fair value
less disposal costs.

Goodwill represents any excess in the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, the value of the non-controlling interests over the net fair value of the acquired
company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a
period of twelve months of the acquisition date. After said time, the effects are recorded directly
in the income statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGU_

Goodwill acquired when businesses are combined is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered by their use or by selling
them.

If the recoverable amount is less than the net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded
for the difference between both amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit or
group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
inflows that are primarily independent from cash inflows generated by other groups of assets.

An analysis of the segmentation of the Group into CGUs resulted in deeming the following as
operating CGUs:

- the perimeter consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries

- the perimeter consisting of AD Polska and its subsidiaries

- the perimeter consisting of Parts Holdings Italia and its subsidiary

_Assessment of recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the net fair
value of the disposal costs or value in use, whichever is higher.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to projected discounted future cash flows
from said assets, in light of economic assumptions and the Group management’s projected
operating requirements.

F-116


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

An impairment loss recorded on goodwill cannot be reversed on account because of an increase
in its recoverable amount.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Depending on the type of instrument, financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are
classified as financial assets at fair value through income, as loans and receivables, as held-tomaturity investments or as financial assets available for sale. On initial recognition, financial
assets are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (except for the
category of financial assets measured at fair value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets when they are initially recognised in
the accounts and, when it is authorised and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each
annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets measured at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income statement includes financial assets
acquired with a view to resale in the short term.

Duly designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2011, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and a fixed maturity date that the Group obviously intends to hold and is able to hold
to maturity. After initially recording them in the accounts, held-to-maturity investments are
valued at amortised cost.

The gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are
derecognised or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2011, the Group did not own any financial assets recorded in the held-tomaturity investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After they have been initially recorded, loans and
receivables are valued at amortised cost applying the effective interest rate method less, where
appropriate, an amount for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any
initial premium or discount and includes fees that form an integral part of the effective interest
rate method as well as transaction costs.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the loans and receivables are
derecognised or are impaired using the amortised cost mechanism.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2011) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income in a reserve for net
unrealised gains and losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accumulated profit or
loss previously recorded in equity is recycled in the income statement. The interest received or
paid on said investments is recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective
interest rate. Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as
“Dividends received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

F-117


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an asset market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other that does not correspond to quoted prices for
identical instruments;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market players would
have applied to value the asset’s other values.

All the fair value measurements are presented in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the discounted value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses
that have not been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective
interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date in the accounts). The asset’s carrying
amount is reduced by using an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be
recorded in the income statement.

Regarding trade receivables, an impairment loss is recorded when there is an objective indication
(such as a probability that the debtor will become bankrupt or is in serious financial difficulties)
that the Group will not be able to recover the amount payable under the contractual terms of
the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account.
The impaired outstanding amounts are recorded as a loss when they are deemed nonrecoverable.

_b) Financial assets at fair value through equity_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost (less the repayment of
the principal and any amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Impairments relating to equity instruments cannot be reversed in the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to debt instruments are reversed in the income statement if the
increase in the instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after
the impairment loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
current year, taking into account an average stock rotation. The valuation of inventory also takes
into account the impact of discounts and allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well
as the transportation cost on purchases.

This method of inventory valuation is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of
the fast stock rotation.

F-118


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price on the reporting date, less estimated selling
costs to sell taking into account their technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating
to slow rotation.

In the case, the inventory shown in the statement of financial position of a company included in
the scope of consolidation derives from a purchase made from another entity that is a member of
the Group is offset against the internal income recorded in the selling company’s accounts is
neutralized.

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash in the
bank and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and investment
securities which meet the criteria of cash equivalent, i.e.:

- short-term investment;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash;

- insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Investment securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds with a negligible risk of
changes in value.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate. The issue costs have an impact on the entry value and are spread via the effective
interest rate method. The amortised issue costs are presented as a deduction from the debts to
which they relate.

The income (loss) is recorded in the income statement when the debts are derecognised and
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.3.14 Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

At 31 December 2011, the Group hedged its exposure to interest rate fluctuations with a cap (see
Note 20.1).

**_3.3.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising
from a past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be necessary in order to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated.

When the Group expects partial or total reimbursement of the provision, for example from an
insurance policy, the reimbursement is recorded as a separate asset but only if the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is
recorded in the income statement net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time-value of money is significant, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the elapsing of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

F-119

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group belongs to basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on the
investment. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid that are recorded as an expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each employee of the Group receives a retirement
severance payment when he retires. This plan is very poorly pre-funded. An independent actuary
calculates the Group’s commitment under this plan annually using the projected unit credit
method. These calculations include actuarial assumptions concerning demographic mortality,
severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined with reference to the
yield from bonds issued by high-ranking companies. The actuarial gains and losses generated are
recognised in accordance with the corridor method. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.3.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or to be received, to the exclusion of discounts and allowances and other
taxes on sales and customs duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in
order to recognise revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of goods.

_b) Rendering of services_

Transactions involving the provision of services are recorded over the period in which the services
are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that accurately discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument so as to obtain the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment thereof is established.

**_3.3.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, personnel costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation
and amortisation expenses.

F-120


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the effect of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.3.18 Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses relates to unusual events with significant amounts effects.

Other operating income can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and gains
on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other operating expenses can also include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as any cost relating to
past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.3.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and rules applied to determine said amounts are those enacted or substantially enacted on the
reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), one of the components of which is the Company Value-Added_
Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed
the methods for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national
accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that, in the
particular case, this contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This
contribution has therefore been classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements
since 1 January 2010.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 12, the classification of the CVAE as income tax resulted
in recognising deferred tax at 31 December 2009 relating to timing differences at this date, with
an offsetting entry in the income statement for the year in accordance with the French Finance
Act enacted in 2009. The deferred tax expense of €0.1 million recorded in 2009 is reversed over a
five-year period, which is the estimated period for settling CVAE bases, in particular the
depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Accordingly, an amount of €0.03 million was
recognised as deferred tax income in 2011. The total amount of the current expense relating to
the CVAE is shown on the same line.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the liability method for any timing differences on the reporting
date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the
statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be charged.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed on each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that a sufficient taxable profit will be available to enable all or
some of said deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profit will enable
them to be recovered.

F-121


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to be applied for the
year in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
that were enacted or substantially enacted on the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is an enforceable legal right to offset them
and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. Tax losses carryforwards of this tax
consolidation group were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in 2011.

Moreover, there is a tax consolidation group in France whose parent is Parts Holdings France and
which includes companies acquired after 2006 and companies that generated a tax loss in 2011.

In view of the amount of tax losses carryforwards and the fact that they were increasing
continuously, the tax group in France was not in a position to pay any tax in the past years; in
2011, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit.

France’s second Amended Finance Act for 2011 has changed the rules for offsetting tax losses
carryforwards. Henceforth, losses that can be carried forward are limited to €1 million plus 60%
of taxable profit exceeding that amount.

The taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 60% of
the tax losses carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the PHF tax consolidation
group in which the available 60% loss relief of tax losses carryforwards also applies.

As the Group’s tax status in France has changed, a tax planning exercise for the operations in
France was carried out on the basis of a three-year business plan for France to determine the
future use of loss carryforwards in light of current loss relief rules and to assess the deferred tax
asset to be recognised in the accounts at 31 December 2011.

This projection shows €78.3 million in tax loss carryforwards would be used i.e., a tax saving of
€27.4 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of
the plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was limited to this
amount.

At 31 December 2011, the loss carryforwards, after allocating €9.3 million to 2011, stood at
€269 million for the expanded base and €285 million for the PHF tax consolidation group.

Regarding the impairment reversal on the AD brand, a deferred tax liability has been recorded.
This is partly offset by a deferred tax asset reflecting the future tax saving that the Group could
reasonably expect to make in the event of the disposal of the brand in view of the existence of
tax loss carryforwards. The balance is a deferred tax liability of €7.6 million. This amount is
reclassified as a deduction from deferred tax assets.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments presenting a
long-term prospect of reversing. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the threeyear business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax asset after said
period, except as a deduction from deferred tax liabilities identified at the year end.

#### 21 Management objectives and policies for financial risks

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
key objective of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risks,
foreign exchange risks, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. These policies are summarised below.

Moreover, the Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise the debt to capital ratios
and the financial leverage obtained by debt.

**21.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk for this portion of the debt.

As the Group’s strategy is to borrow at fixed rates to reduce its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations, hedges are taken out for variable-rate borrowings.

In January 2010, the Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap with
the following characteristics:

- Underlying liability = €58.0 million

- Term = 3 years

- Maturity = 31 December 2012

- Capped rate = 3.0%

- Benchmark index = 3-month Euribor

- Revised = Quarterly (31 March/30 June/30 September/31 December)

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**21.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles described in
Note 3.3.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2011. No specific hedges were taken out for this exchange
risk.

**21.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group only has commercial relationships with third parties that are financially healthy. The
Group’s policy is to verify the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment credit
terms. Moreover, customer balances are continually monitored and, accordingly, the Group’s
exposure to bad debt is not material.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the relevant third parties with a maximum exposure
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

**21.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with these covenants may
result in early repayment of credit lines (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA,

- Cash flow/servicing of the debt.

In connection with the takeover of the Parts Holdings Group (France), the renegotiated bank
agreement does not provide for the calculation of any financial ratios before 30 June 2012.

**21.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2010, mortality rates were defined individually based on prospective tables by generation
(TPG-93).

The mortality tables used in 2011 are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They include both the “gender” factor
and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment grade
bonds.

Employee turnover rates are shown in the table below:

**2011** **2010**

_Bank covenants_

The bank agreement signed with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to
compliance with the bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012 following the
takeover of the Parts Holdings Group (France). Failure to comply with said covenants could result
in the early repayment of financing lines.

Bank overdrafts in Poland are secured by pledges of inventory for a total value of €15.5 million.

**29.4 Individual training entitlement**

The balance of the number of unused hours at 31 December 2011 was 511,364. The number of
hours accrued over the year was 96,399 and 12,206 hours were used.

**29.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automobile spare parts in France,
brought proceedings against Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the French
Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established
commercial relationship. Their claim is approximately €2.4 million. No provision was set aside in
the Group’s accounts as of 31 December 2011 as management and its advisors considered that, in
view of the facts of the case, there is a low risk of conviction.

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your articles of association and by a
collective decision of the shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
December 31, 2010, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France);

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

#### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the group as at December 31, 2010 and of the results of
its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

#### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de
commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the
following matters:

- In the context of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods applied by your
company, we have ensured that the accounting rules and methods relating to business
combinations, deferred taxes, pensions and other post-employment benefits, and inventory
impairment, as described respectively in the notes 3.3.8, 3.3.19, 3.3.15b) and 3.3.11 to the
consolidated financial statements, are appropriate and were applied consistently. In the case
estimates need to be performed for their implementation, our procedures consisted in
assessing the data and assumptions on which these estimates were based, and the
reasonableness of the resulting valuations.

- The group performs systematically, at the end of each reporting period, impairment tests of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and also assesses whether an

indication of impairment of other non-current assets exists, following the methodology
described in the notes 3.3.7 and 3.3.8b) to the consolidated financial statements. We have
reviewed the soundness of the chosen approach and the assumptions used for these
impairment tests and we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of the calculations
made by the group in that respect. We have also ensured that the information given in the
notes 3.2.1, 3.3.7, 3.3.8b), 6.5, 8.1 and 8.2 to the consolidated financial statements is
appropriate.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

#### III. Specific verification

As required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in
France, the information presented in the group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

Schiphol Boulevard 329, 1118 BJ Luchthaven, Schiphol, Netherlands.

#### 3 Accounting rules and methods

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S. and all its subsidiaries (the
“Group”) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2010 and available on the following
website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (€m) unless stated otherwise.

**3.1** **Basis of preparation**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009, with the exception of
the adoption of the following new standards and interpretations:

- Amendment to IFRS 2 — Share-based Payment — with respect to cash-settled share-based
payment intra-group transactions;

- Improvements to IFRSs 2007-2009 (April 2009): These improvements mainly concerned the
following standards:

  - IFRS 5 — Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, to clarify
disclosure requirements for groups of assets reclassified as “Assets held for sale”,

  - IFRS 8 — Operating Segments, to eliminate the requirement to disclose the amount of
segment assets if this information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision
maker (alignment with the equivalent provision on segment liabilities),

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IAS 1 — Presentation of Financial Statements, to clarify that the holder’s option to unwind
a convertible debt instrument in equity within 12 months has no impact on its classification
as current or non-current,

  - IAS 7 — Statement of Cash Flows, specifies that only expenses having led to the
recognition of an asset in the statement of financial position can be classified as cash flows
from investing activities,

  - IAS 17 — Leases, on the classification of land leases,

  - IAS 18 — Revenue, introducing criteria to determine whether the entity is acting as an
agent or as a principal in a business transaction,

  - IAS 36 — Impairment of Assets, to clarify that the largest unit for goodwill allocation is the
operating segment pursuant to IFRS 8,

  - IAS 39 — Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, to clarify the accounting
treatment of agreements for the acquisition or disposal of a business and the event that
triggers the subsequent recycling to income in a cash flow hedging relationship;

- IFRIC 18 — Transfers of Assets from Customers;

- IFRIC 17 — Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, this interpretation indicates how to
account for dividends paid in kind to all of the entity’s shareholders. This has no impact on the
Group’s financial statements;

- Amendment to IAS 39 — Eligible Hedged Items;

- IFRIC 15 — Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate;

- IFRS 3R — Business Combinations;

- IAS 27 (amended) — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements

The prospective application of these amendments had no impact on the recognition of
business combinations and the changes in ownership interests prior to 1 January 2010 which
were recognised in accordance with the accounting methods defined by IFRS 3 and IAS 27 as
set out in Notes 3.3.8 et seq.;

- IFRIC 16 — Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation;

- IFRIC 12 — Service Concession Arrangements.

The adoption of these standards and interpretations has had no impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

The Group has not early adopted the following standards and interpretations adopted by the
European Union, but not mandatory at 1 January 2010:

- IFRIC 19 — Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments;

- Amendments to IFRIC 14 — Pre-payments of a Minimum Funding Requirement;

- IAS 24 — Related Party Disclosures (as revised in 2009);

- Amendment to IAS 32: Classification of Rights Issues.

In addition, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendments, which the
European Union had not adopted at 31 December 2010:

- Amendment to IFRS 7 — Transfer of Financial Assets;

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments;

- Improvements to IFRSs 2010 — May 2010;

- Amendment to IAS 12 — Recovery of Underlying Assets.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Group is reviewing all these standards and interpretations in order to measure their
potential impact on the results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess the
impact on disclosures. At this stage, the Group does not anticipate a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

**3.2** **Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty connected to the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial year could involve a
significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an
indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are subject to an impairment test when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

Provisions for impairment were calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows taking into
account the components of the debt restructuring plan.

The impairment test performed on goodwill and the AD brand resulted in recording an
impairment of €368.5 million and €150.4 million, respectively, in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, the
impairment test did not result in the recognition of additional impairment or the reversal of
previously recognised impairment (reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited).

Impairment tests on goodwill are based on the medium-term plan discount rate and EBITDA. The
assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following
the amendment of one of the variables.

The AD brand is part of the France CGU and the assessment of the valuation of the AD brand
therefore partially depends on the France CGU.

At 31 December 2010, consolidated net assets amounted to €194.9 million and the valuation of
the France CGU based on the Group’s business plan amounted to €271.8 million. This value is
compared to €177.8 million for all the consolidated net assets (excluding brands). However, the
value of the France CGU is highly sensitive to the achievement of the business plan which is likely
to have implicit consequences on the brand’s maximum value. For example, 86% achievement of
EBITDA targets would bring the brand’s value close to its carrying amount in the financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2010. In this context, the provision for the brand was
reversed in 2010 for an amount of €10.6 million. The assumptions for the valuation of the brand
will be reassessed in 2011.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.3.8.

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax losses carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The
calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to
estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable
profits, with regard to tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2010, the Group did not recognise any deferred tax assets on tax losses
carryforwards. Further details are provided in Notes 3.3.19 and 6.7.

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions as regards discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases, the mortality rate and the rate of pension increases. Owing to the longterm nature of such plans, there is great uncertainty about these estimates. The net liability in
respect of these employee benefits at 31 December 2010 stood at €24.7 million. Further details
are provided in Note 21. There are no other post-employment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale. Inventory
impairment rates are reviewed periodically.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2010 totalled €18.8 million.

**3.3** **Summary of the main accounting methods**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reference period as those of the parent company, applying
homogeneous accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets, and which are generated by internal
transactions, are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group took control of them, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such
control, in accordance with the following methods:

- Full consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
companies directly or indirectly controlled by the parent company or its subsidiaries.

- Equity method: the financial statements of companies over which the Group has significant
influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, they are shown separately from the share attributable to owners of the
parent.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its accounts.

The financial statements of entities that use a different functional currency from the euro are
translated as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate on the reporting date.

- Income statement and statement of cash flows items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

F-162


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from said conversion are allocated directly to a separate
line item under equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of
deferred foreign exchange gains or losses shown in the separate item of equity and relating to
said foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the euro are
located in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on the transaction date. On the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on that date. All differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Replacement costs and major inspections are included in the carrying amount of the property,
plant and equipment if the accounting criteria are met.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds of
disposal of said asset and its carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in
which it is derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method in
accordance with the following periods of use:

Property 25 years
General fixtures and fittings 5 years
Equipment and machinery 10 years
IT equipment 2 years
Transportation equipment 5 years
Furnishings 5 years

The residual values, useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and
modified, if necessary, on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at their purchase cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
for IAS 38 are met.

F-163


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised in accordance with their economic useful life and are subject to
an impairment test whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The
amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least on the reporting date every year. Any change to the projected useful life or projected rate
of consumption of the representative future economic benefits of the asset is recorded by
changing the amortisation period or method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated
as changes in estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s
function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category, and comprise, primarily, software licences for
Movex accounting software and the current logistics project.

These fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following
estimated period of useful life:

Software 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These fixed assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either
individually or at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the intangible asset belongs. The
useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If not, the
change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded
prospectively.

Gains or losses arising on the derecognition of intangible assets are equal to the difference
between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the asset. They are recorded
in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of acquisition, is attached to the cash
generating unit consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries.

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement on its commencement date. This requires assessing whether performance of the
agreement depends on the use of a specific asset or specific assets, and whether the agreement
grants a right to use the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, the
commencement date is deemed to be 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the term of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if it is lower, at the discounted value
of the minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are broken down
between the financial expense and the amortisation of the debt so as to obtain a constant
periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The financial expense are
recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets that are subject to a finance lease are amortised over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the asset
when the lease expires.

F-164


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2010, the Group has finance leases in the capacity of lessee (see Notes 27.1
and 27.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred when
negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded over
the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is recorded
as income from ordinary activities over the period in which it is acquired.

At 31 December 2010, the Group does not have any finance leases in the capacity of lessor.

**_3.3.6 Non-current held-for-sale assets and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities is/are
presented separately in the statement of financial position when it is/they are significant,
without restatement of previous periods. The assets or groups of assets are measured at the
lower of their carrying amount and their estimated selling price less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operation for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held-for-sale assets or it must form part of an overall plan to sell an
operation or a significant geographical area for the Group; or, finally, it must be a significant
subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. The components of the income statement
and statement of cash flows relating to said discontinued operations are presented separately in
the financial statements for all the periods presented if they are significant. The components of
the statement of financial position relating to previous years are not presented separately; only
the components of the last period shown are classified as assets and liabilities discontinued.

There were no discontinued operations at 31 December 2009 or 31 December 2010 (see Note 5).

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, individually or at the level of
the cash-generating unit to which they are attached.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on other assets or groups of assets. If the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is deemed to have lost
some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. Value in use is
determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

F-165


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the level of its recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation or amortisation, if no
impairment had been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss
reversal is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the revised
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at fair value on the acquisition date, which takes
into account all the probabilities of occurrence. Considerations are classified as debt or equity
according to their nature, those classified as debts are then remeasured at fair value and the
difference recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date, with the
exception of non-current assets classified as held-for-sale assets, which are recorded at fair value
less disposal costs.

Goodwill represents any excess in the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, the value of the non-controlling interests over the net fair value of the acquired
company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a
period of twelve months of the acquisition date. After said time, the effects are recorded directly
in the income statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGU_

Goodwill acquired when businesses are combined is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered by their use or by selling
them.

If the recoverable amount is less than the net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded
for the difference between both amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit or
group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
inflows that are primarily independent from cash inflows generated by other groups of assets.

An analysis of the segmentation of the Group into CGUs resulted in deeming the following as
operating CGUs:

- the perimeter consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries, as the purchasing centre’s
results and cash cannot be separated from the other French operating entities;

- the perimeter consisting of AD Polska and its subsidiaries;

- the perimeter consisting of Parts Holdings Italia and its subsidiary.

F-166


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_Assessment of recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the net fair
value of the disposal costs or value in use, whichever is higher.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to projected discounted future cash flows
from said assets, in light of economic assumptions and the Group management’s projected
operating requirements.

An impairment loss recorded on goodwill cannot be reversed because of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

At 31 December 2010, Group management relied on the following assumptions to carry out its
impairment tests:

- Future cash flows were estimated based on the 2011 budget, the profit improvement plan for
2012 and 2013 and the business plan drawn up within the framework of the restructuring plan
as set out in the recovery plan for subsequent years.

- The terminal value was determined based on the last year of the plan without taking into
account growth assumptions.

- A 10% discount rate was used to discount future cash flows and the terminal value.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Depending on the type of instrument, financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are
classified as financial assets at fair value through income, as loans and receivables, as
held-to-maturity investments or as financial assets available for sale. On initial recognition,
financial assets are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (except for
the category of financial assets measured at fair value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets when they are initially recognised in
the accounts and, when it is authorised and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each
annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets measured at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income statement includes financial assets
acquired with a view to resale in the short term.

Duly designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2010, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and a fixed maturity date that the Group obviously intends to hold and is able to hold
to maturity. After initially recording them in the accounts, held-to-maturity investments are
valued at amortised cost.

The gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are
derecognised or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2010, the Group did not own any financial assets recorded in the held-tomaturity investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After they have been initially recorded, loans and
receivables are valued at amortised cost applying the effective interest rate method less, where

F-167


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

appropriate, an amount for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any
initial premium or discount and includes fees that form an integral part of the effective interest
rate method as well as transaction costs.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the loans and receivables are
derecognised or are impaired using the amortised cost mechanism.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2010) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income in a reserve for net
unrealised gains and losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accumulated profit or
loss previously recorded in equity is recycled in the income statement. The interest received or
paid on said investments is recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an asset market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other that does not correspond to quoted prices for
identical instruments;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market players would
have applied to value the asset’s other values.

All the fair value measurements are presented in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of impairment on loans and receivables recorded at amortised
cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the discounted value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate
calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by using an
impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the income
statement.

Regarding trade receivables, an impairment loss is recorded when there is an objective indication
(such as a probability that the debtor will become bankrupt or is in serious financial difficulties)
that the Group will not be able to recover the amount payable under the contractual terms of
the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account.
The impaired outstanding amounts are recorded as a loss when they are deemed nonrecoverable.

F-168


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_b) Financial assets at fair value through equity_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost (less the repayment of
the principal and any amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Impairment relating to equity instruments cannot be reversed in the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to debt instruments are reversed in the income statement if the
increase in the instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after
the impairment loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
current year, taking into account an average stock rotation. The valuation of inventory also takes
into account the impact of discounts and allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well
as the transportation cost on purchases.

This method of inventory valuation is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of
the fast stock rotation.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price on the reporting date, less estimated selling
costs taking into account their technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to
slow rotation.

In the case the inventory shown in the statement of financial position of a company included in
the scope of consolidation derives from a purchase made from another entity that is a member of
the Group, the internal income recorded in the selling company’s accounts is neutralized.

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash in the
bank and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and investment
securities which meet the criteria of cash equivalent, i.e.:

- short-term investment;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash;

- insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Investment securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds with a negligible risk of
changes in value.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate. The issue costs have an impact on the entry value and are spread via the effective
interest rate method. The amortised issue costs are presented as a deduction from the debts to
which they relate.

The income (loss) is recorded in the income statement when the debts are derecognised and
through the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2010, the Group hedged its exposure to interest rate fluctuations with a cap (see
Note 20.1).

**_3.3.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising
from a past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be necessary in order to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated.

When the Group expects partial or total reimbursement of the provision, for example from an
insurance policy, the repayment is recorded as a separate asset but only if the repayment is
virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the
income statement net of any repayments.

If the effect of the time-value of money is significant, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group belongs to basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on the
investment. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid that are recorded as an expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each employee of the Group receives a retirement
severance payment when he retires. This plan is not pre-funded. Independent actuaries calculate
the Group’s commitment under this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These
calculations include actuarial assumptions concerning mortality, turnover rates and future salary
projections.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined with reference to the
yield from bonds issued by high-ranking companies. The actuarial gains and losses generated are
recognised in accordance with the corridor method. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.3.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or to be received, to the exclusion of discounts and allowances and other
taxes on sales and customs duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in
order to recognise revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of goods.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_b) Rendering of services_

Transactions involving the rendering of services are recorded over the period in which the
services are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that accurately discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument so as to obtain the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment thereof is established.

**_3.3.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, personnel costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation
and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the effect of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.3.18 Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses relates to unusual events with significant amounts effects.

Other operating income can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and gains
on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other operating expenses can also include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as any cost relating to
past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.3.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and rules applied to determine said amounts are those that were enacted or substantially
enacted on the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), one of the components of which is the Company Value-Added_
Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed
the methods for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national
accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that, in the
particular case, this contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This
contribution has therefore been classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements
since 1 January 2010.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 12, the classification of the CVAE as income tax resulted
in recognising deferred tax at 31 December 2009 relating to timing differences at this date, with
an offsetting entry in the income statement, in accordance with the French Finance Act enacted

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

in 2009. The deferred tax expense of €0.1 million is recorded under “Income tax” for 2009. In
addition, as of 2010, the total amount of the current and deferred tax expense relating to the
CVAE is presented on the same line.

The deferred tax expense of €0.1 million recorded in 2009 is reversed over a five-year period,
which is the estimated period for settling the CVAE bases, in particular the depreciation of
property, plant and equipment. Accordingly, an amount of €0.03 million was recognised under
deferred tax income in 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the liability method for any timing differences on the reporting
date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the
statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be charged.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed on each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that a sufficient taxable profit will be available to enable all or
some of said deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profit will enable
them to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to be applied for the
year in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
that were enacted or substantially enacted on the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is an enforceable legal right to offset them
and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

#### 4 Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 25 and the amount of goodwill in Note 8.

**4.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2010**

**_4.1.1 Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

On 1 April 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Arnaudiès for €2.1 million. This
company is located in Pamiers in the French department Ariège and generates annual revenue of
approximately €6 million. The cash contributed by Arnaudiès amounted to €0.1 million.

The goodwill in respect of this acquisition amounted to €2.5 million (see Note 8.1).

**_4.1.2 Incorporation of companies_**

Neoparts was incorporated in May 2010. It is held at 20% (€0.2 million) by FIA, a Group
subsidiary, and is consolidated in the Group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity
method. It took over the FIA Littoral business, sold by FIA on 1 June 2010.

On 31 December 2010, the Group incorporated Comptoir Technique du Limousin which is wholly
owned by AM Développement.

**_4.1.3 Disposals_**

Adelta SA was disposed of in June 2010. The company was therefore derecognised at this date
with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**4.2** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2009**

**_4.2.1 Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

The Group increased its stake in AD Normandie Maine by acquiring 28.48% of its shares for
€4.5 million. This transaction led to the recognition of €0.3 million in goodwill (see Note 8.1) and
€3.3 million in debt in respect of a put option held by minority shareholders. The stake held in
the company is now 79.40%.

In January 2010, the minority shareholders of AD Polska exercised their put option with regard to
their shares. The Group therefore increased its stake in its subsidiary AD Polska which is now
wholly owned.

**_4.2.2 Incorporation of companies_**

No companies were incorporated in 2009.

**_4.2.3 Disposals_**

The Group sold its 44% stake in AD Nederland (Netherlands) in December 2009 as well as its
100% stake in Sport 2000 (France) in October 2009.

These companies were therefore deconsolidated from these dates with no material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

#### 5 Discontinued operations

**5.1** **Discontinued operations at 31 December 2010**

The Autodistribution Group decided not to discontinue or dispose of any operations in 2010.

#### 20 Management objectives and policies for financial risks

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
key objective of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risks,
foreign exchange risks, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. These policies are summarised below.

Moreover, the Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise the debt to capital ratios
and the financial leverage obtained by debt.

**_20.1 Interest rate risk_**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk for this portion of the debt.

In January 2010, the Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap with
the following characteristics:

- Underlying = €58.0 million

- Term = 3 years

F-185


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- Maturity = 31 December 2012

- Capped rate = 3.0%

- Benchmark index = 3-month Euribor

- Revised = quarterly (31 March, 30 June, 30 September, 31 December)

**20.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles described in
Note 3.3.1.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2010. No specific hedges were taken out for this exchange
risk.

**20.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group only has commercial relationships with third parties that are financially healthy. The
Group’s policy is to verify the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment credit
terms. Moreover, customer balances are continually monitored and, accordingly, the Group’s
exposure to bad debt is not material.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the relevant third parties with a maximum exposure
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

**20.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with these covenants may
result in early repayment of credit lines (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA,

- Cash flow/servicing of the debt.

In connection with the takeover of the Parts Holding (France) Group, the renegotiated bank
agreement does not provide for the calculation of any financial ratios before 30 June 2012.

**20.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.
