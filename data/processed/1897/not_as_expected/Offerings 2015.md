**OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

# DAKAR FINANCE S.A.
### €239,000,000 9.000% / 9.750% SENIOR HOLDCO PAY-IF-YOU-CAN NOTES DUE 2020
Dakar Finance S.A., a société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (the
“Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €239.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9.000% / 9.750% Senior HoldCo
Pay-If-You-Can Notes due 2020 (the “Notes”), as part of the financing for the proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of
Autodis Group S.A.S. (the “Target”) by Dakar Acquisition S.A. (“BidCo”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Issuer.
The Notes will mature on November 15, 2020. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15
and November 15, commencing May 15, 2016. The first and last interest payments on the Notes will be made in cash. For
each other interest payment, the Issuer will be required to pay interest on the Notes entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”),
unless the conditions described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) are satisfied, in which case
the Issuer will be entitled to pay, to the extent described herein, interest for such interest period by increasing the
principal amount of the Notes or by issuing Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest (in each case, “PIK
Interest”). Cash Interest will accrue at a rate of 9.000% per annum on the Notes, and PIK Interest will accrue at the rate of
9.750% per annum on the Notes.
Prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes by paying a
“make-whole” premium. At any time on or after November 15, 2016, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer may
redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain
equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, provided that at least 50% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding. Upon certain events defined as
constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the
Notes. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of
the Notes.
Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds
from the Offering into an escrow account which will be pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release
of the escrowed proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the
Acquisition. The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to April 15, 2016 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption
price will be a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date (as defined below) to the date of special mandatory redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” The escrow account will be charged on a
first-ranking basis to secure the Notes.
The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s
existing and future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will not be
guaranteed by any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations
of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, including the Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein), borrowings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), trade payables and lease obligations. The Notes will be secured on the
Completion Date (as defined herein) by first-priority pledges over (i) the capital stock of the Issuer, (ii) the preferred
equity certificates owed by the Issuer and (iii) the bank account of the Issuer (the “Collateral”). The validity and
enforceability of the security interests are subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on validity and
_enforceability of the security interests.”_
The Notes will be represented on issuance by one or more Global Notes (as defined herein), which we expect will be
delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme
(“Clearstream”) on or about November 12, 2015 (the “Issue Date”). Interests in each Global Note will be exchangeable for
the relevant definitive notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”
Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted
to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. No certainty can be given that this application will be granted.

**_INVESTING IN THE NOTES INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. SEE “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE 25_**
**_FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISKS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN THE NOTES._**
**Issue price of the Notes: 99.5%, plus accrued interest from November 12, 2015**
**The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the**
**“U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are being offered and sold in the United**
**States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the U.S. Securities Act and**
**outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”) and, if investors are**
**residents of a member state of the European Economic Area, only to qualified investors. Prospective purchasers that are**
**qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the**
**provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For further details about eligible offerees and**

# Notice to European Economic Area investors

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that the offer and sale of the Notes
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive (as defined below) as
implemented in member states of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), from the requirement to
produce and publish a prospectus which is compliant with the Prospectus Directive, as so
implemented, for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any
offer within the EEA or any of its member states (each a “Relevant Member State”) of the Notes
that are the subject of the placement referred to in this Offering Memorandum must only do so
in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to
produce and publish a prospectus that is compliant with the Prospectus Directive, including
Article 3 thereof, as so implemented for such offer. For EEA jurisdictions that have not
implemented the Prospectus Directive, all offers of the Notes must be in compliance with the
laws of such jurisdictions. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do
they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other
than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute a final placement of the Notes
contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

In relation to each Relevant Member State, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed
that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in
that Relevant Member State it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes that are the
subject of this Offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the public in that
Relevant Member State other than:

  - to any legal entity that is a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

  - to fewer than 100 natural or legal persons or, if the Relevant Member State has
implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150 natural or
legal persons (other than “qualified investors” as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as
permitted under the Prospectus Directive subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

  - in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided
that no such offer of the Notes shall result in a requirement for the publication by the
Issuer or the Initial Purchasers of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Directive.

-----

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to
any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to
enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes, as such expression may be
varied in the Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in
that Relevant Member State. For the purposes of this provision, the expression “Prospectus
Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD
Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any
relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State; and the expression “2010 PD
Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.

Law; or

the Prospectus Law); or

(c) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Issuer of a
prospectus pursuant to Article 5 of the Prospectus Law.

amended.

persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

# Forward-looking statements

This Offering Memorandum includes forward-looking statements which are based on our current
expectations and projections about future events. All statements other than statements of
historical facts included in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, statements
regarding our future financial position, risks and uncertainties related to our business, strategy,
capital expenditures, projected costs and our plans and objectives for future operations, may be
deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“may,” “assume,” “plan,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “risk” and similar expressions
or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the
future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

In addition, any forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forwardlooking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent
written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf
as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, you
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we compete to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. Factors that
could cause such differences in actual results include:

  - the impact of material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network and
increases in transportation costs;

  - the ability of third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements;

  - the impact of French, Polish and worldwide economic conditions on demand for our
products;

   - the risk that our customers’ financial difficulties require us to write off debts;

  - the impact of competition in the spare parts distribution industry;

  - our reliance on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks and the length of
service intervals;

  - disruption of our IT systems;

  - the increasing use of technology in our industry;

  - failure to maintain or improve our brand image;

vi


-----

  - the risk that our growth strategy may not be successful;

  - our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our network;

  - the impact of price and margin pressures;

  - the termination of our affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors;

  - our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

  - the impact of changes in laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and
employment;

  - the deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions;

  - the impact of higher employment costs;

  - the impact of environmental, health and safety regulations;

  - the risk associated with fluctuations in our working capital requirements;

  - the risk of material losses as a result of product liability and warranty claims, including
claims for products we import from outside the European Union;

  - the impact of legal and arbitration proceedings;

  - our failure to comply with tax regulations and actions by tax authorities;

  - the impact of competition and antitrust laws; and

  - other risks associated with our financing, the Notes and our structure discussed under “Risk
_factors.”_

We disclose important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
expectations in “Summary,” “Risk factors” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of
_financial condition and results of operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum_
describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk
factors. We cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

# Industry and market data

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and
the markets in which we operate and compete. We have generally obtained the market,
competitive position and cost savings data in this Offering Memorandum from industry
publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources commissioned by us,
including Roland Berger.

We believe that these industry publications, surveys and studies are reliable. We cannot,
however, assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information and we have not
independently verified such industry and market data.

Industry and consultant publications and forecasts generally state that the information they
contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. While we believe that each of the studies
and publications we have used is reliable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have
independently verified the data that was extracted or derived from these industry and consultant
publications or reports and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Market data and
statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such
statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective
judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types
of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market.

# Presentation of financial information and other data

### Financial statements presented

We have included in this Offering Memorandum an English translation of, and primarily discuss
herein, the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Target as of and for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 with
corresponding unaudited income statement and cash flow data for the eight months ended
August 31, 2014.

The consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 included
in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from the comparative information contained in
the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013. See “—Restatements.” The summary unaudited consolidated financial
information for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015 included in this Offering
Memorandum has been derived by adding the consolidated financial information of the Target
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the consolidated financial information of the
Target for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 and subtracting the consolidated financial
information of the Target for the eight months ended August 31, 2014. The financial information
for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only
and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date. This information has not been audited or reviewed by any
auditors. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 included in this Offering Memorandum has
been derived from the comparative information contained in the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statement as of and for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

The Issuer, LuxCo 5 (as defined herein) and BidCo were formed on October 9, 2015,
September 17, 2015 and October 9, 2015, respectively, for the purpose of facilitating the
Transactions (as defined herein). None of the Issuer, LuxCo 5 or BidCo has any business operations
or material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and
the Transactions. Consequently, limited historical financial information relating to the Issuer is
available, and no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this Offering
Memorandum, except for certain limited as adjusted financial data presented on a consolidated
basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions. All historical financial information
presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Target and its subsidiaries, which includes
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (as defined herein). Accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “Group” in respect of financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to
the Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Issuer is a holding, management and
finance company with no revenue-generating activities of its own. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The Issuer is a holding company with no business_
_operations or assets.” The audited consolidated financial statements of the Target, an English_
translation of which is included herein, have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015 with corresponding unaudited income statement and cash flow data for the
eight months ended August 31, 2014 included herein have been prepared in accordance with IAS
34 “Interim Financial Reporting” the IFRS standard applicable to interim financial statements.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should
consult your own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and
generally accepted auditing principles in the United States and how those differences could
affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial
statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Critical accounting_
_policies.”_

Our financial statements are presented in euro rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may
occur due to such rounding. Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the
financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, figures
shown as totals in some tables may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that
precede them.

The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and
2014 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are uncertified English translations and
were originally issued in French.

### Other financial measures

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, EBITDA
margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, EBIT, EBIT margin, operating cash flow, cash
conversion, change in working capital, change in working capital margin and capital expenditure
margin (collectively, the “Non-IFRS measures”) (each as defined by us) that are not required by,
or presented in accordance with, SEC requirements, IFRS, French GAAP (as defined herein) or the
accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We have included these measures because
management uses them to measure operating performance in presentations to our directors and
as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, as well as for monitoring certain aspects of our
cash flows from operating activities and liquidity. Our Non-IFRS measures are defined by us as
follows:

  - “EBITDA” represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax,
financial items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from
operations and depreciation/amortization expense (as included in our financial statements
for the years ended December 31 2012, 2013 and 2014 and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2014 and 2015). For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income/(loss) from
continuing operations, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial
_and other information”;_

  - “EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as EBITDA divided by revenue;

  - “Adjusted EBITDA” represents EBITDA as adjusted for (i) certain non-cash items, (ii) certain
items we believe are non-recurring, (iii) the purchasing savings realized following the
acquisition of ACR on a run-rate basis from September 1, 2014, and (iv) the spreading over
four years of the costs incurred in connection with the organization of the meeting of the
Target Group’s network in September 2014, which occurs every four years. Adjusted
EBITDA is presented because we believe it is a relevant measure for assessing performance
and cash flows and thus aids in understanding our profitability for a given period. For a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary
_consolidated financial and other information”;_

  - “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA
divided by revenue;

  - “EBIT margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as EBIT divided by revenue;

  - “Operating cash flow” represents Adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisition of fixed assets,
net of disposals. For a reconciliation of operating cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA, see
footnote 8 under “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other information—
_Other financial and pro forma data”;_

  - “cash conversion,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital
expenditures, divided by Adjusted EBITDA;

  - “change in working capital” represents the change in inventories, trade payables, trade
receivables and other current assets and liabilities;

  - “change in working capital margin,” expressed as a percentage, is calculated as change in
working capital divided by revenue; and

  - “capital expenditure margin,” expressed as a percentage, represents investments in
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets divided by revenue.

We present the Non-IFRS measures for informational purposes only. There can be no assurance
that items we have identified for adjustment as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that
similar items will not be incurred in the future. The calculations of the Non-IFRS measures are
based on various assumptions and management estimates. These amounts have not been and, in
certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm.

We present the Non-IFRS measures because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures
of our operating performance and ability to service our debt and because our management uses
these measures to assess our liquidity and operating performance. These measures should not be
considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any
other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

Our Non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools. Our Non-IFRS measures may not give
an accurate or complete picture of our results or transactions for the periods presented, may not
be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision. The limitations with respect to our Non-IFRS measures include:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments on our debt;

  - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required
to pay;

  - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
statements of cash flows;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we
consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and

  - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to
be replaced in the future, and the Non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements
for such replacements.

Other companies in our industry may calculate the Non-IFRS measures differently than we do,
which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our NonIFRS measures and related ratios should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations or reduce our indebtedness. You should compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS measures only
as a supplement to evaluate our performance.

### Restatements

Since January 1, 2013, we have applied amendments to the existing standard IAS 19R “Employee
Benefits.” Since these amendments were applied retroactively, our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 have been restated solely for
comparative purposes. The most significant change relates to the recognition of all actuarial
gains or losses. This new version of the accounting standard also resulted in a change in the
accounting treatment of past service costs which can no longer be deferred and must
immediately be recognized. This leads to the immediate recognition of all the actuarial variances
and past service costs in our balance sheet liabilities. Actuarial variances will be fully recognized
through other comprehensive income/(expense) directly in equity and past service costs in period
net income. These amendments also define the return on assets as the discount rate used to
measure the benefits liability. Financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for
the year ended December 31, 2012 is based on the restated information included in our financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Since January 1, 2015, we have applied the interpretation IFRIC 21 which clarifies that the
obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant
legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. Since these amendments were applied
retroactively, our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for
the eight months ended August 31, 2014 reflect the effects of the application of IFRIC 21.

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also
hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, we generated 90.6% of our revenue in France and 9.4% of our revenue in
Poland. We believe that as of December 31, 2014, we held a market share of approximately 23%
in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. The IAM has demonstrated
resilience in recent years and currently benefits from advantageous long-term trends. Our scale
provides us with significant purchasing power with aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our
extensive network throughout France, which we have expanded with the ACR Acquisition, allows
us to deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our whollyowned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these parts,
equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for light
vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and operate
under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to
garages represented 77% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended August 31,
2015, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 23% of our revenue in
France over the same period. As of August 31, 2015, we had a network of 38 wholly-owned
distributors and 42 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out
of 492 distribution sites, comprising 323 wholly-owned and 169 affiliated distribution sites, which
are supplied either by our four warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle
collision repair parts and one for truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use
a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure the efficient management of our
supply chain and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery
schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44 distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 125,000 endcustomers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages. Approximately
3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an affiliate
program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in return our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred
distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from central
purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in the
markets in which we operate.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated


1


-----

independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, we generated revenue of €1,211.6 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €86.1 million.

Of the €847 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2015, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 53.8%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
15.3%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.1%; and
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.7%. The remaining €250.5 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015 was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Our strengths

**_Stable and resilient light vehicle and truck aftermarket_**

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car park”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has proven resilient
during recent economic downturns, when new car sales tend to decline. For example, the French
light and heavy commercial vehicle aftermarket (at distribution level) increased by 2.4% and
1.0% between 2010 and 2014, respectively. This resilience is due in part to several beneficial
trends which we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a stable car park size, a
continuing increase in the average age of the car park, increasingly complex and technologically
advanced vehicle parts, and advantageous regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions in which we
operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in which we operate has led
to an increase in the average age of the car park, resulting in a growing share of cars beyond the
manufacturer warranty period and in need of repair and maintenance. Independent garages
sourcing IAM-provided spare parts create value for owners of such beyond warranty period cars
looking for an alternative to expensive manufacturer dealers’ garages.

**_Leading distributor in the profitable French independent aftermarket sector_**

We are the leading distributor of parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in France, with
over 50 years of experience. As of December 31, 2014, we held an estimated market share of
approximately 23% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. Our leading
position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand and our extensive distribution network provide us
with a strong platform to deliver a broad range of spare parts, equipment and tools on a timely
and efficient basis. We also enjoy a strong regional position in the light vehicle IAM in Poland
through our wholly-owned distributors in southern Poland.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability for customers. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive
distribution network organized around our central purchasing departments, four specialized
national warehouses and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for the
direct supply of spare parts and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are
handled separately from our logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the
supplier, we use a customized IT system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain
and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our
distribution system is also capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to
efficiently handle high volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and,
ultimately, driving increased customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution
system taking into account each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our


2


-----

operational flexibility and efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of
service to our customers. For example, we separated our light vehicles and trucks spare product
lines into two distinct business units in order to optimize their supply chains and capitalize on
their respective efficiencies.
Our vertically integrated distribution system and extensive network of distributors and garages
provide us with a competitive advantage in France over smaller operators because smaller
operators lack our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a
founding partner of the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest European
purchasing networks of independent distributors for spare parts, which further enhances our
purchasing power, allows us to obtain rebates and complements our leading position in France
by giving us access to best practices of other AD International partners abroad. We believe that
the advantages of our vertically integrated distribution system are difficult to replicate because
of the significant time and resources that would be required to reproduce our existing
infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a large
customer base of light vehicle and truck garages (which include independent garages, body
shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages and car centers). We serve more than 125,000 end-customers in
France, including our approximately 3,200 branded garages. We service our customers through
both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, 77% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to garages through our
wholly-owned distributors, and 23% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated
independent distributors that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient
distribution network and our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on
a timely and efficient basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to
develop and maintain our large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers
targeted by our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not
overlap due to the commercial arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated
independent distributors. In addition, we are focused on developing new customer segments and
have set up a separate sales department to target insurance clients in order to strengthen our
commercial relationships with these companies and increase our share of the collision repair
market.

**_High-quality service based on extensive product portfolio, highly efficient operations and_**
**_customized IT systems_**
Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately one million commonly used spare parts from
over 300 suppliers, including a new product line for windscreens. We believe that our suppliers
view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for the IAM, which allows
us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse range of suppliers. This is
because we are one of the few distributors in our market with the scale, warehouse logistics,
distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and distribute a large number of
spare parts, equipment and tools for an increasingly complex market. The number of car and
truck brands and models in the car park continues to increase and, as a result, the related
assortment of car and truck spare parts increases each year. We believe that our extensive
product portfolio, combined with our extensive range of services, make us attractive to the
growing number of multi-brand garages that are moving away from single-brand, manufacturerspecific dealers.
Our logistics platforms are well invested and allow us to operate industry-leading distribution
networks. As of August 31, 2015, Logisteo, our central warehouse from which we distribute spare
parts for light vehicle repair and maintenance, was the largest independent logistics platform for
light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France, with over 20,000 square meters of
storage space that stored over 57,000 spare parts references of 140 brands. It supplies 492
distribution sites, comprising 323 wholly-owned and 169 affiliated distribution sites, and employs
approximately 250 people. Since July 2015, we have made significant investments in the
automation of the processes in our Logisteo warehouse in order to improve the accuracy and


3


-----

speed with which products are delivered to customers and increase our product offering. As of
August 31, 2015, we had already invested €2.4 million in this project and expect that completion
of the project during the course of the next 18 months will generate cost savings for us in the
long term. In 2013, we also invested in the expansion of our call center for our collision repair
service in order to improve the quality of our service for our collision business customers.

Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platforms allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items
and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online business-tobusiness car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and Truckissimo,
respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly order from a
large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby improving the
customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe that these web portals
provide us with a competitive advantage, and approximately €122 million, or 18.2%, of our
revenue from sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015 were placed
through our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services
we offer drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.

Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. In late 2013 and early 2014, we upgraded the warehouse IT management
system of our light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the
process of upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a
tablet-based program that allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and
to make suggestions for purchases based on the customer’s profile. We believe that our IT
systems provide us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a
timely and efficient basis.

As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts, equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to operate
efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our marketleading positions. As a result, we have made, and expect to continue to make in the future,
judicious investments in IT.

**_Improved financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light business_**
**_model_**

During the last three fiscal years, we generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA
margin from 4.4% to 5.9%, and maintained stable cash flow generation despite the recent
economic downturn, with a cash conversion (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure,
divided by Adjusted EBITDA) of 68.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, 68.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2013, 73.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 72.5% for the
twelve-month period ended August 31, 2015. For the eight months ended August 31, 2015, we
achieved an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.1%. We have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin
improvement during the last five years by implementing a series of profit enhancement
measures: since these measures were implemented, our EBITDA has increased more than
€65 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the twelve months ended August 31,
2015. These measures include, among others: the maximization of suppliers’ rebates via increased
purchasing by our central purchasing departments and integrated Group-wide purchasing
(including our affiliated independent distributors), cost reductions in the aggregate
compensation of local management and administration through the implementation of shared
services, and reductions in transportation and logistics costs by optimizing the delivery routes
between our distribution sites and our customers and increasing the use of central distribution
facilities. In addition, we improved our cash flows from operating activities (including changes in
working capital and other items with cash effect) from €15.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010 to €50.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015.


4


-----

We operate a capex-light business model using rented facilities, and thus our operations do not
require us to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, our capital expenditures amounted to 2.0% of our revenue and consisted of
maintenance expenditures for our distribution facilities, and upgrades to our sales and
warehouse IT management systems, as well as our first investment in Logisteo’s automation
process development. Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements (as a
percentage of revenue) have allowed us to invest in our business, maintain our leading market
positions, improve operating efficiency and achieve deleveraging through Adjusted EBITDA
growth and cash generation.

**_Experienced and successful management team with strong support from our sponsor_**

Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, and our Group CFO, Christophe
Gouthière, have more than 70 years of combined experience in the distribution and light vehicle
sectors and have a proven track record in developing and implementing turnaround and growth
strategies. Our Chairman, Olivier Roux, is the former co-CEO of the Rhiag Group, a leading
distributor in the Italian, Swiss and Eastern European light vehicle aftermarkets, and has
extensive experience in the light vehicle aftermarket. Our Group CEO, Stéphane Antiglio, is the
former CEO of Pomona Passion Froid, the frozen food distribution branch of Pomona. Our Group
CFO, Christophe Gouthière, was previously European CFO of the Dole Group, a leading
distributor of fresh fruit and vegetables. Our Chairman, Group CEO and Group CFO, supported by
an experienced management team, have successfully implemented profit improvement
initiatives. We believe that the success of our management team in completing our profit
improvement plan and returning our business to profitable growth has laid a solid foundation
for further growth and increased profitability. The support, investment experience and sector
expertise of our sponsor, Bain Capital, will supplement the leadership and expertise of our
management team.

### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience, we believe that we are well positioned
to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light vehicle IAM. To accomplish
this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our sales force performance and
practices, develop new key accounts, expand our commercial relationships with fast-fitters and
enhance the efficiency of our supply chain for express orders. As part of this strategy, we
acquired ACR on April 7, 2014. ACR is a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light
vehicles with an established footprint in the internet sales channels. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2015, ACR generated gross revenue (before customer rebates) and
stand-alone EBITDA of €82.9 million and €7.2 million, respectively. Internet dealers, key accounts
and others (including distributors) accounted for approximately 40%, 18.5% and 41.4% of gross
revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, ACR generated gross revenue
(before customer rebates) and stand-alone EBITDA of €75.1 million and €6.1 million, respectively.
Internet dealers, key accounts and others (including distributors) accounted for approximately
36.5%, 19.6% and 43.9%, respectively. We may also seek to expand our geographic coverage by
making selective acquisitions which are accretive to our network.

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a compound average growth rate (CAGR)
of 11.4% between 2010 and 2014. We intend to leverage our logistics platforms, competitive
prices and high levels of service to continue to win new contracts with insurance companies for


5


-----

our collision repair services. We plan to channel this business to our branded garages in order to
strengthen our partnerships with such garages and insurers and increase demand for the
provision of collision repair parts from our distributors.

**_Enhance customer service_**

We intend to continue to enhance the high-quality service that we provide to customers by
ensuring seamless execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already
extensive product assortment. We believe that our range of spare parts on offer, efficient and
effective order execution, and timely product delivery will continue to drive customer loyalty. We
plan to shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. The ACR Acquisition has
allowed us to benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its specialization
in deliveries within two to four hours of order.

We seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to capture
market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand our
portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line for
the light vehicle and truck aftermarket and the private label product line of ACR for the light
vehicle aftermarket. We also plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We
believe that this approach will allow us to address different types of customers with different
value propositions, ultimately optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase
in private label product lines as a percentage of our total revenues will improve our
competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources
and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations and reduce
fixed costs in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further standardize our central
administration and enhance our IT support in order to implement these changes. In addition, we
intend to continue to invest in our logistics platforms in order to reduce costs, facilitate
operational efficiencies, strengthen our supply chain and provide our customers with better
product coverage and availability. By further enhancing existing software and installing new
software, such as the recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light
vehicle logistics platform, we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of
orders. We also intend to further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our EBITDA
margins in Poland pursuant to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, the scale
increase resulting from the ACR Acquisition has allowed us to further improve our purchasing
performance as we shared a significant number of suppliers with ACR, which now benefits from
the more advantageous terms of our existing agreements with these suppliers. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, we estimate that the purchasing savings resulting from the ACR
Acquisition on a run-rate basis will amount to €6.5 million, of which €5.9 million had already
been achieved as of August 31, 2015. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the share of
purchases made by our affiliated independent distributors through our central purchasing
departments, which we expect will further increase our sales volumes and improve our
purchasing power.


6


-----

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 10% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, which target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. The integration of ACR, which serves online light
vehicle spare parts retailers, increases our presence in this segment of the IAM. Whether an order
is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely over-the-counter
product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to online-only light vehicle
spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts. We regularly
assess our over-the-counter sales vis-à-vis our existing business-to-business sales objectives in
terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our over-the-counter sales on our
business-to-business sales.

### The Transactions

**_The Acquisition_**

On October 14, 2015, BidCo, an entity indirectly controlled by Bain Capital and the indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire all the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Target (the “Acquisition”). We currently expect the
Acquisition to complete at the end of November 2015. The consummation of the Acquisition is,
however, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the European
Commission, and the performance of certain closing actions. If clearance by the European
Commission is not obtained on or prior to the Acquisition Longstop Date, the Acquisition
Agreement will terminate automatically. In connection with the Acquisition, Bain Capital intends
to establish a management equity plan pursuant to which our senior management may hold
ordinary and preferred shares in LuxCo 2. See “Certain relationships and related party
_transactions—Management equity plan.”_

BidCo, public limited liability company (société anonyme) is incorporated and existing under the
laws of Luxembourg, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LuxCo 5, a private limited liability company
(société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo
5, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, a public limited liability company (société
_anonyme) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. The Issuer, in turn, is a_
wholly-owned subsidiary of LuxCo 3, a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité
_limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 3, in turn, is majority_
owned by LuxCo 2, a partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par actions)
incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 2, in turn, is controlled by LuxCo
1, a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing
under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 1, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CaymanCo, a
limited partnership expected to be formed on or prior to the Completion Date in the Cayman
Islands. Each of CaymanCo, LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2, LuxCo 3, the Issuer, LuxCo 5 and BidCo were
acquired or incorporated by Bain Capital as acquisition vehicles for the Transactions. None of
CaymanCo, LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2, LuxCo 3, the Issuer, LuxCo 5 or BidCo has any business operations or
material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and
the Transactions.

**_The Financing_**

The total aggregate financial resources required in order to consummate the Acquisition
(excluding the Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the repayment of the Contingent Value
Instruments, which will be made with cash available at the Target Group (see “—Target Group
_debt repayment”)), and pay for all transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection_
therewith, is expected to be €397.0 million and is expected to be financed (collectively, the
“Financing”) with the following cash and non-cash financial resources:

  - Bain Capital will make a cash contribution of approximately €146.5 million directly to
CaymanCo by way of a subscription for ordinary shares, which will, indirectly through


7


-----

LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2 and LuxCo 3 (through equity subscriptions and/or PECs), be contributed
to the Issuer (collectively, the “Equity Contribution”);

  - certain other existing investors, including management, the Chairman of the Target Group
and certain Affiliated Distributors, will invest an amount expected to be approximately
€12.7 million in LuxCo 2 by way of a subscription for ordinary shares and preferred shares
(the “Management and Existing Investors’ Investment”); and

  - the Issuer will issue the Notes offered hereby in the aggregate principal amount of
€239.0 million and will contribute approximately €196.7 million of the proceeds thereof,
together with the proceeds of the Equity Contribution and the Management and Existing
Investors’ Investment, to LuxCo 5, which will in turn make a contribution of approximately
€355.9 million to BidCo (in each case, through equity subscriptions).

The proceeds of the Notes will be used as further described under “—Sources and uses of the
_Transactions.”_

As of the Completion Date, we will refinance our Existing Revolving Credit Facility by entering
into the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement which will provide for a New Revolving Credit
Facility in the amount of €40.0 million which will be available for general corporate purposes and
working capital needs of the Group. We currently expect that the New Revolving Credit Facility
will remain undrawn as of the Completion Date. See “Use of proceeds.”

We refer to the Acquisition and the Financing collectively as the “Transactions.” See “Use of
_proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of certain financing arrangements” and “Description of_
_the Notes.”_

**_Escrow Account_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross
proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by
the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds and the consummation of the
Acquisition are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Description of the Notes—
_Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” If the Acquisition is not consummated on or_
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will
be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a
price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”
In the event that the funds on deposit in the Escrow Account are insufficient to pay the special
mandatory redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
Bain Capital will be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required
to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between Bain Capital and the
Issuer. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption” and
“Risk factors—Risks related to the Acquisition—If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied,
_the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return_
_you expect on the Notes.”_

**_Target Group debt repayment_**

The Seller has agreed in the Acquisition Agreement to use its best efforts to cause:

  - the Target to repay the Contingent Value Instruments in full for an estimated cash amount
of €5.3 million (with any amount payable in excess of €4.7 million to be treated as
“leakage” under the Acquisition Agreement and to be deducted from the equity purchase
price for the Target) on or about the Completion Date using cash on hand; and

  - the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to redeem €30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103%, plus accrued interest thereon (the
“Senior Secured Notes Redemption”), on or prior to the Completion Date using cash on
hand.

### Recent developments

The information below is based on internal management accounts and is subject to change as it
is reviewed by us and our auditors.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated revenue of approximately
€911 million, an increase of approximately 5.0% compared to our revenue for the corresponding
period in 2014. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we generated Adjusted EBITDA
of approximately €65 million, an increase of approximately 40% compared to our Adjusted
EBITDA for the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in revenue was primarily due to
organic growth and better market conditions and to the acquisitions made in 2014, including the
impact over the whole period of the ACR Acquisition, which was completed on April 7, 2014. The
increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the performance of our distributors across all
business lines, particularly our light vehicles and collision parts business lines, driven by increased
sales volume and supplier rebates on the one hand, and improved operational logistics
capabilities following the implementation of our new warehouse IT system on the other hand.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, we generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
of approximately €1,213 million and approximately €87 million, respectively.

This information has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management, and has
not been audited, reviewed or verified; no procedures have been completed by our auditors with
respect thereto, and you should not place undue reliance thereon. This information is subject to
confirmation in our audited consolidated financial statements and report for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The security
interests in the Collateral are limited as necessary to

by local law and defenses generally available to
providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of

_enforceability of the security interests.”_

**Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory**
**redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account.
The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow
Agent, and pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of
the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.
Upon delivery to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent of
an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to
the release of the proceeds from escrow are satisfied,
the escrow proceeds will be released to the Issuer and
utilized as described in “The Transactions,” “Use of
_proceeds,” and “Description of the Notes—Escrow of_
_proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” The release_
of escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, including the consummation of
the Acquisition. The consummation of the Acquisition
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement is subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, including
regulatory approval.

In the event that (i) the Completion Date and the
release of escrow proceeds does not take place on or
prior to Escrow Longstop Date, (ii) in the reasonable
judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be
consummated by Escrow Longstop Date, (iii) the
Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date, (iv) a Default or Event of
Default relating to insolvency events arising under the

and control a majority of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Issuer, the Notes will be subject to a
special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price will, in each case, be a price equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, from the Issue Date to the date of the special
mandatory redemption. The escrow proceeds would be
applied to pay for any such special mandatory
redemption. In the event that the funds on deposit in
the Escrow Account are insufficient to pay the special
mandatory redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, Bain Capital
will be required to make an equity contribution to the
Issuer in an amount required to enable the Issuer to
pay such accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes,
pursuant to an agreement between Bain Capital and
the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
_proceeds; special mandatory redemption” and ”Risk_
_factors—Risks_ _related_ _to_ _the_ _Acquisition—If_ _the_
_conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the Issuer_
_will be required to redeem the Notes, which means_
_that you may not obtain the return you expect on the_
_Notes.”_

**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or
after November 15, 2016 at the redemption prices
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
_redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

In addition, prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer
may redeem all or part of the Notes by paying a
“make whole” premium as described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional redemption.”

Prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer may on one or
more occasion(s) use the proceeds of specified equity
offerings to redeem up to 40% of the principal
amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
109.000% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, up to the redemption date, provided that at
least 50% of the principal amount of the Notes
remains outstanding after the redemption.

**Additional amounts; Tax redemption . . .** All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer in
respect of the Notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for any taxes, except to the
extent required by law. If any such withholding or
deduction is required by law in any relevant taxing
jurisdiction, subject to certain exceptions and
limitations, the Issuer will pay additional amounts so
that the net amount received is no less than that
which would have been received in the absence of
such withholding or deduction. See “Description of
_the_ _Notes—Withholding_ _taxes.”_ The Issuer may
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any


15


-----

time, upon giving prior notice, if, as a result of certain
changes in tax law the Issuer is or would be required
to pay additional amounts with respect to the Notes.
If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right,
it must pay a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes plus interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for taxation
_reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control, it will be
required to offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of
their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
such repurchase. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of control.”_

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture.
The Indenture limits, among other things, the ability
of the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries of the
Issuer to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and
issue certain preferred stock;

                   - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make
certain investments;

                     - make certain other restricted payments;

                       - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

                      - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

                       - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries
to pay dividends or make other payments to us;

                       - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including
subsidiary stock;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                       - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of
significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain covenants” and
the related definitions.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for
as long as we achieve investment-grade ratings. See
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Certain_ _covenants—_
_Suspension_ _of_ _covenants_ _on_ _achievement_ _of_
_investment grade status.”_

**Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the gross proceeds from the
Offering, together with the Equity Contribution, the
Management and Existing Investors’ Investment, and
cash on hand at the level of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Target, to: (i) fund the consideration
payable for the capital stock of the Target purchased
in the Acquisition; (ii) prefund cash interest payments
due on the Notes offered hereby (the “Cash Coupon

Pre-Funding”); (iii) fund the Senior Secured Notes
Redemption; (iv) repay the Contingent Value
Instruments; and (v) pay the fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions,
including estimated fees and expenses to be incurred
in connection with the Offering. See “The
_Transactions—The Financing” and “Use of proceeds.”_

**Transfer restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under U.S. federal or state or any foreign security laws
and are subject to restrictions on resales. See

not intend, to register the Notes in the United States
under the U.S. Securities Act.

Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit
them for trading on the Global Exchange Market

payable in cash at least annually over the term of the
Notes, the Notes will be considered to be issued with
original issue discount OID for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. U.S. holders (as defined herein) generally
will be required to include amounts representing OID
in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a

# Risk factors

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to considering carefully, in_
_light of the circumstances and your individual investment objectives, the information contained_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the risks described below_
_before investing in the Notes. If any of the events described below actually occurs, our business,_
_results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected and,_
_accordingly, the value and the trading price of the Notes may decline, resulting in a loss of all or_
_part of any investment in the Notes. The order in which the risk factors are presented does not_
_necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude or significance of the_
_individual risk factors. Furthermore, the risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the_
_only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we_
_currently consider to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_results of operations or financial condition._

### Risks related to our business

**_Material disruptions at our warehouses or to our transportation network, or significant_**
**_increases in transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As of August 31, 2015, our distribution network infrastructure in France was composed of our
central purchasing departments, four main warehouses (one for each of light vehicle parts, light
vehicle collision repair parts and truck parts, and one for ACR), connected to 38 wholly-owned
distributors (operating 323 sites) and 42 affiliated independent distributors (operating 169 sites).
Of the total value of all products that we purchased from our referenced suppliers in France
during the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, products representing 45% in value were
delivered through our four main warehouses to our wholly-owned and affiliated distributors and
products representing 55% in value were delivered directly to our distributors by spare parts
manufacturers. In Poland, we operated three warehouses and 44 distribution sites. We rely on
road transportation for the prompt transfer of the products that we distribute from our
warehouses or distribution sites directly to our customers.

A material disruption at any one of our warehouses or distribution sites in France or Poland or to
our transportation network caused, for example, by weather-related problems, employee strikes,
lock-outs and inadequacies in the transport infrastructure, or other events, could affect our
ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner or at all, which, in turn, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any damages that may arise or to
compensate us for any losses that we may incur, due to such interruption of our operations.

We are dependent on third parties for the transportation of orders, and this service could be
disrupted. In the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, transportation costs accounted for 3.5%
of our revenue. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time,
particularly in connection with oil prices, and increased transportation costs could result in
reduced profits. Any disruption in transportation services, or any increases in the cost of
transportation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and are dependent on the ability_**
**_of our third-party suppliers to meet our product requirements._**

We do not manufacture any of the products that we distribute and, therefore, rely on over
300 third-party suppliers for the provision of light vehicle and truck spare parts, equipment and
tools that are essential to our business. Our business and, ultimately, our results of operations are
dependent on our suppliers’ ability to provide us with such products. Our suppliers may fail to
meet delivery deadlines, provide us with sufficient products or comply with our quality
requirements. The capacity of some of our suppliers to meet our supply requirements may in the
future be constrained at various times and our suppliers may be susceptible to production
difficulties, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in
manufacturing costs or other factors that negatively affect the quantity or quality of their
production.

25


-----

Production by one or more suppliers could be disrupted due to a variety of factors, including
closures of one of our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical
breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, financial distress or bankruptcy, as well as
political upheaval, adverse economic events or logistical complications, weather, natural
disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing or other events. Any short-term or
prolonged disruption in the supply of spare parts from our suppliers could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that
one or more of our major suppliers experiences operational or financial difficulties, and we are
unable to secure alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially beneficial terms, we
may experience inventory shortages which could result in unfilled customer orders and lost
revenues due to our “just-in-time” delivery method, as well as damage to our business
reputation.

If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products under our
presently agreed terms, or if we are unable to obtain products from our suppliers in the future at
favorable prices, our margins will likely be negatively impacted and there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if there is
a significant or unexpected drop in customer demand or if there is a significant increase in
customer demand that we are unable to meet from our “on-hand” inventory stock or procure in
time from our suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

**_Our business is exposed to risks associated with economic conditions in France, Poland and_**
**_worldwide._**

The demand for certain of the products that we distribute may be impacted by economic
conditions in France, Poland and worldwide, and our business is impacted by growth in the
French economy. The light vehicle spare parts aftermarket tends to be affected in the early
period of a recession, when end-customers delay the maintenance of their light vehicles. The
truck spare parts aftermarket is more cyclical than the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket, due
to the correlation of the demand for road freight with general economic conditions.
Simultaneously, de-stocking occurs at all levels of the spare parts supply chain, which may cause a
short- to medium-term decreases in sales by distributors of light vehicle and truck spare parts.
France is our principal geographic market, representing 90.6% of our revenue in the twelve
months ended August 31, 2015. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle
IAM, where we generated 9.4% of our revenue over the same period. Economic uncertainty, in
France and globally, could decrease consumer confidence and consumer and business spending
on vehicle maintenance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We cannot predict the timing or duration of any economic slowdown or the timing or strength
of a subsequent economic recovery, worldwide or in France. If the light vehicle and truck spare
parts aftermarket significantly deteriorates due to economic conditions, it could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continued uncertainty in
global economic conditions (particularly in the eurozone) also poses a risk to our existing
contractual arrangements and the fulfillment of obligations by us, our product suppliers or our
customers. If the current economic situation deteriorates significantly or if one or more eurozone
countries were to depart from the euro, our business could be materially adversely impacted.

We are also subject to the risk of increased costs due to general economic conditions, both in
forms of increased employee costs and increased costs of operational costs. Any failure to pass
such increases in costs on to our customers could impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Financial difficulties of our customers may require us to write off debts._**

Across each of our business lines, we rely on the ability of our customers to pay for the products
that we distribute. If an affiliated independent distributor or other customer undergoes financial
difficulties, payments can be significantly delayed and ultimately we may not be able to collect
amounts payable to us under our agreements, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain
reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due. There can be no assurance, however, that

26


-----

such reserves are sufficiently large for the credit risks we face, particularly in relation to our
affiliated independent distributors. Significant or recurring incidents of bad debts would
adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our industry is highly competitive._**

We operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from a variety of types of
spare parts distributors and sellers in the highly fragmented French and Polish spare parts
aftermarket in which we operate. We primarily compete on the basis of product availability,
delivery lead time, quality of service, product range and technical support. Our main competitors
are other light vehicle and truck spare part distributors in France (such as Groupauto) and Poland
(such as Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union Polska), as well as new online light vehicle and
truck spare parts distributors, which mainly compete with us on the basis of price. We believe
that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the internet before making a
purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive price.

Over time, online light vehicle and truck spare parts distributors may adopt our business-tobusiness distribution and logistics model, reduce costs and demand lower prices for the spare
parts they sell. Furthermore, in certain countries, low-cost discount distributors have emerged
that primarily compete on the basis of price and offer lower prices for the spare parts that they
sell, and such low-cost discount distributors may decide to enter the French market. In addition,
our competitors that currently purchase spare parts from suppliers on a decentralized basis may
consolidate their purchasing functions across their various operations, subsidiaries or owned or
affiliated distributors, and their purchasing scale may enable them to purchase spare parts at
prices that are lower than we can obtain. As a result, they may be able to offer certain spare
parts to customers at lower prices than we can. Our failure to adapt to these or other changes in
the competitive landscape could result in a low profit margin, decreased revenue and loss of
market share and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our customers also compete with car dealers such as Peugeot and Renault. Car dealers typically
specialize in light vehicles and trucks aged zero to four years old and capture a large share of
light vehicle and truck repairs covered by warranties. Certain car dealers, however, have
extended their new light vehicle warranties to up to eight years, and provide for long-term
service programs to customers. If light vehicle and truck manufacturers continue to significantly
expand (for example, as a result of changes in the legal environment) the scope of their
warranties beyond the current limits, especially for replacement parts and maintenance items,
these replacements and maintenance parts covered by such extended warranties would likely be
performed by car dealers instead of us.

**_Our sales depend on the age, number and mileage of light vehicles and trucks used in France_**
**_and the length of service intervals._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by the age, number and mileage of
light vehicles and trucks used in France and the length of service intervals. As light vehicles and
trucks get older, expenses for light vehicle and truck spare parts generally increase.
Consequently, a decline in the age of light vehicles and trucks could lead to decreased demand
for the products that we distribute and our services. We consider our core market to be light
vehicle and trucks aged over four years. We believe that light vehicle and truck repairs are
currently being made at a later date and to a lesser extent. The technological and qualitative
improvements of many light vehicle and truck components can lead to a decrease in demand for
light vehicle and truck spare parts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

A decline in the use of light vehicles could result in a related decrease in demand for light vehicle
spare parts. Factors such as higher gasoline prices or gasoline taxes, a significant deterioration in
economic conditions, environmental concerns or limitations on tax breaks for commuting costs
and the introduction of a road charge for light vehicles and trucks and potential speed limits in
cities could reduce light vehicle and truck spending. Similarly, changes in traveling or commuting
behavior (for example, through the increased use of public transport or light vehicle sharing) or
continuing urbanization could decrease the average mileage of light vehicles and demand for

27


-----

the products that we distribute and our services. Such a decline in demand could have an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Disruptions in our IT systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

The software we use and develop in collaboration with third-party software companies facilitates
our ability to efficiently manage supply flows, operational data and other management and
financial information, and to provide management with current inventory levels at our
warehouses. In particular, our customized IT systems allow us to identify, in real time, the
availability of any particular product that is ordered within our distribution network. We depend
on the continuous availability and reliability of our IT platform, which, in turn, depends on the
functioning of our IT hardware and is, therefore, subject to operational risks such as the
occurrence of equipment failures, power interruptions and unlawful conduct by third parties. The
performance of our IT systems also depends, among other things, on our ability to effectively
safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage from interruptions to
telecommunication services and from computer viruses. The occurrence of any such events, and
any consequent slowdown or interruption to telecommunication services may impair our ability
to manage supply flows, operational data and other management and financial information and
to provide management with current inventory levels at our warehouse, which could, in turn,
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

For example, we have recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse
IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our
inventory more efficiently. The implementation of new IT systems may cause organizational
disruptions within our Group. In addition, there can be no assurance that our new warehouse
IT management system, or any future IT systems, will deliver the projected efficiencies.

One of our strategies is to increase sales of products that we distribute through our websites. The
implementation of this strategy will require additional IT resources and may result in a disruption
to our existing computer and telecommunications systems, whether in connection with the
implementation of expanded capabilities or otherwise, which could, in turn, adversely affect our
online sales and/or our business reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
maintain and upgrade our IT systems in a manner that will avoid interruptions or disruptions of
such systems. Any failure or inability to maintain and upgrade our IT systems may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Continued technological advancements in light vehicle and truck parts could affect our sales._**

The demand for the products that we distribute is affected by technological and qualitative
improvements in new light vehicles and trucks, and the light vehicle and truck market is
characterized by frequent technical advances and increases in the complexity of existing
components. Certain light vehicle and truck spare parts may feature complex or innovative
technology that can only be maintained by persons with special training or at specialized
garages. This technology may also require continuous training and regular updating in relation
to a particular light vehicle or truck model. For example, repairs of sensors as well as repairs of air
conditioning systems require special skills, training and equipment. The independent garages
that are the primary end-users of the parts we distribute may not continue to obtain the
information and training necessary to maintain the complex technology featured in our endcustomers’ vehicles, and the expertise to install and repair these parts may only be available at
car dealers. Moreover, the expenses required for specialized staff training as well as the
sophisticated equipment required to test and repair these evolving components could result in
higher costs or higher capital expenditure for us or for our end-customers. In certain cases, it may
no longer be economically feasible for independent garages to offer repair services for particular
light vehicle and truck models or spare parts. Furthermore, sophisticated manufacturing
technology for light vehicle and truck spare parts improves their quality and reduces the number
of replacements and repairs they require. If light vehicle and truck spare parts are replaced less
frequently, our revenue could decrease.

The IAM in which we operate differs from the original equipment supplier aftermarket segment
(“OES”), in which operators are linked to the light vehicle manufacturers who directly supply

28


-----

them with the necessary technical information on vehicle components and repair procedures.
Due to ongoing technological developments in the manufacturing of light vehicles and trucks,
independent garages are required to gain appropriate technical expertise in newly developed
components. The failure of independent garages to gain the appropriate technical expertise, or
access to the tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand, may
result in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by car dealers with
the necessary technical expertise (which garages represent a small portion of our revenues),
which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our business depends in part on a strong brand image and if we are not able to maintain and_**
**_enhance our brand or market our product offerings we may be unable to attract a sufficient_**
**_number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of the products that we distribute._**

We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success
of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand are integral
to the success of our business and to the implementation of our growth strategy. This will require
us to make further investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as our website
operations. For example, we have developed websites for each of our distributors and garages,
and in September 2014, we invested in a large customer event to develop our brand.
Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our
marketing and merchandising effort, and our ability to provide good customer experiences. Our
brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or
reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Our brand image may also be diminished
if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of
quality products, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all of our
operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience
other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong
brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, we distribute products to approximately 3,200 branded garages and 42
affiliated independent distributors that have entered into affiliation agreements with us, but
whom we do not control. These branded garages and affiliated independent distributors may
take actions or make decisions that adversely affect our brand and reputation.

Our principal brand names and trademarks, such as Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD and Auto
Primo, Autossimo, AD PL and ISOTECH, and the “AD” logo are key assets of our business. See
“Business—Intellectual property.” We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent
laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but we cannot assure you that the
actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent any violation or
challenges to our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not
be necessary in order to enforce our trademark or other intellectual property rights or to defend
ourselves against third-party claims of infringement of their rights. Adverse publicity, legal action
or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brands and trademarks,
which could, in turn, lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our growth strategy will require us to expand and improve our operations, and risks associated_**
**_with our expansion plans may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Our growth strategy includes, among others, strengthening our market position in France. We
may implement this strategy through organic growth, diversifying our activities or selected
acquisitions. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including paying too high a purchase price or the
assumption of unexpected liabilities. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions
may depend on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds
necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Our failure
to identify suitable acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. In
addition, the integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel,
particularly in respect of businesses operating in adjacent markets, could be more difficult and
time-consuming than anticipated, which could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key
employees and customers, and a failure to realize anticipated operating savings.

29


-----

Our logistics complexity will increase as our footprint grows. This increased complexity will
require that we continue to expand and improve our capabilities, including our IT and other
logistics management capabilities, as well as to grow, train and manage our employee base. We
will also need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our information and distribution systems,
controls and procedures related to financial reporting. Implementing new systems, controls and
procedures and any changes to existing systems, controls and procedures could present
challenges that we do not anticipate and which could negatively impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, this increased complexity will require us to
continually evaluate whether personnel with appropriate levels of expertise and experience are
properly allocated in accordance with our growth strategy, and any failure to allocate such
personnel may make it more difficult to achieve our growth strategy.

Our growth could also make it difficult for us to adequately predict the expenditures we will
need to make in the future. This growth could impact the operational flexibility and reactivity of
our supply chain and make us unable to react as promptly to changing customer demands and
new market trends as we have been able to do historically. We may not be able to anticipate
all of the demands that our expanding operations will impose on our business, personnel,
systems, controls and procedures, and our failure to appropriately address such demands could
materially adversely impact our existing operations and prevent us from implementing our
growth strategy.

**_We may face significant challenges in integrating acquired businesses and in integrating any_**
**_future potential acquisition, and may be unable to realize the expected savings from these_**
**_businesses and any other cost improvement measures we have taken._**

In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For
example, in 2014, we acquired ACR. The integration of an acquired business, or any future
potential acquisition, requires the dedication of management resources that can temporarily
divert attention from our day-to-day business. The process of integration can also interrupt our
activities, which can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. If we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses or any future
potential acquisition within a reasonable time following its acquisition, we may not be able to
realize the potential and anticipated benefits thereof.

In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a
targeted manner. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to identify suitable
businesses or investment opportunities and be able to acquire, or make the investment, on
favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all material risks in connection with the acquisition
of a company or the making of investments will be identified in the due diligence process and
may not, therefore, be taken into account when deciding whether to acquire the business or
make the investment. These risks may materialize only after a company has been acquired or an
investment has been made, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related agreements
or by insurance policies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The products that we provide may be exposed to price and margin pressures, and we may be_**
**_unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers at competitive pricing and_**
**_margin levels._**

We may be forced to decrease prices for the products that we distribute due to a number of
factors, such as challenging macroeconomic conditions or increased competition. In our industry,
both light vehicle and truck spare parts manufacturers set retail prices through official
recommended prices for the end-customer. Each participant in the value chain, including us, then
sets its prices as a percentage of the recommended price on the basis of its targeted gross
margin. We may be unable to compensate for a decrease in recommended retail prices by
obtaining supplier rebates, attracting new business, reducing our operating costs (for example,
through headcount reductions, increases in labor productivity or other gains in cost efficiency) or
otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

30


-----

In addition, the impact of laws and regulations, particularly labor and employment laws and
regulations, may restrict our ability to achieve cost reductions and other efficiency gains. See
“—Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and
_employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition” below. Price and margin pressures may_
therefore lead to a reduction in average prices and margins for our services, which could also
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A decrease in the number of affiliated independent distributors in our network or a decrease in_**
**_demand for certain key spare parts may adversely impact our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We have entered into affiliation agreements with affiliated independent distributors and
branded garages. These agreements allow them to use one of our brands, including AD Garage,
Garage Expert AD and Auto Primo, and in return the affiliated distributors designate us as their
preferred supplier and the independent garages designate our distributors as their preferred
distributors. We have recently renewed our agreements with our affiliated independent
distributors for a further seven years. Nonetheless, if any of these distributors were to breach
their agreements with us by prematurely terminating their relationship with us, the size of our
distribution network and our customer base could be reduced and our profitability significantly
harmed as a result. In addition, our customers mostly purchase light vehicle and truck spare parts
based on their existing needs, but are not required to purchase a minimum amount of any of the
products that we distribute. Therefore, a significant decrease in demand for certain key spare
parts for both light vehicles and trucks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that we do not maintain our existing
level of business with our customers, we will need to attract new customers or win new business
with our existing customers and if we are unable to do so, our business, results of operations and
financial condition may be adversely affected.

**_The departure of members of our management team or other key personnel, or our inability to_**
**_attract and retain qualified management or other key personnel, could have an adverse effect_**
**_on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our success is largely dependent upon the continued service and skills of our existing
management team. If one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or
unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily and
our business may be disrupted, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. Competition for management and key personnel is intense,
and the pool of qualified candidates is limited, so we may not be able to attract and retain
experienced executive or key personnel in the future, which could hinder our ability to run and
develop our business successfully. In addition, if any of our executives or other key personnel
joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, know-how and other
key personnel, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Our business is subject to various laws and regulations, including in relation to labor and_**
**_employment, and changes in, or violations of, such laws or regulations may adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations
relating to labor, employment, health and safety. The modification, suspension, repeal or
expiration of favorable provisions in labor and employment laws and regulations or, conversely,
any increases of mandatory minimum wages pursuant to laws, regulations or collective
bargaining agreements, or of social security contributions, may negatively impact our business
and profitability. For example, in France we benefit from reductions in employer social security
contributions on certain wages pursuant to law 2003-47 of January 17, 2003, as completed by law
2008–1258 of December 3, 2008 (the “Fillon Law”), as well as from a tax credit for
competitiveness and employment (crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi) (“CICE”).
Pursuant to CICE, French companies receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid to
employees whose wages are less than or equal to 2.5 times the French statutory minimum wage

31


-----

for 2013 and 6% in 2014 and subsequent years. The Fillon Law allows employers to benefit from
reductions in such social security contributions in respect of wages that amount to less than
160% of the French statutory minimum wage.

Any unfavorable changes in the Fillon Law, CICE or other labor and employment laws and
regulations, or in the terms of collective bargaining agreements applicable to our business, as
well as any increases of the statutory minimum wage in any country or industry in which we
operate, may increase our payroll costs and negatively affect our operating margins and
operational flexibility, and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

In January 2013, an agreement was reached between national employer representatives and
trade unions in France regarding certain labor market reforms. Many provisions of this
agreement now appear in the law on job security published on June 14, 2013. This law provides,
among other things, additional charges on fixed-term employment contracts, greater regulation
of part-time employment and an extension of the scope of complementary health benefits to all
employees. These measures have been implemented with no material cost impact as of
August 31, 2015 but we cannot assess the impact of such new measures on our future operations
and they may have an adverse impact on our costs. Labor market reform in general continues to
be a key policy measure on the French government’s political agenda, and changes in any of the
above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations
could substantially increase our operating costs or restrict our operational flexibility and
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_A deterioration in our relationships with our employees or trade unions or a failure to extend,_**
**_renew or renegotiate on favorable terms our collective bargaining agreements could have an_**
**_adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of August 31, 2015, we had 6,133 employees. Maintaining good relationships with our
employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result,
any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee
representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. See “Business—Employees.”

Some of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These
agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other
things, the general working conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours,
holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining
agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability
to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate employees. We may not be able to
extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the
expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or
without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to
additional company-specific agreements or amendments to the existing national collective
bargaining agreements. Such additional company-specific agreements or amendments may
increase our operating costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

While in the last three years we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as
a result of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes, such events could disrupt our
operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits, or otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increased employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

Our labor costs may rise faster than expected in the future as a result of a larger workforce,
salary increases and headcount increases. We may be unable to offset the increase in labor costs
through increased selling prices or productivity gains. If labor costs increase further, our
operating costs will also increase, which could, if we are unable to recover these cost increases
from our customers through increased selling prices or offset such cost increases through labor
productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

32


-----

**_Environmental, health and safety regulations relating to our operations could subject us to_**
**_increasing costs or fines._**

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of European directives and
regulations, national, state and local laws, rules, taxes and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment, workers’ health and safety and the use, management, storage and disposal
of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials. These include, in particular,
requirements governing the disposal of used oil, batteries, tires and other materials processed in
our recycling business. These laws, rules and regulations may affect the way in which we conduct
our operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other
penalties.

In addition, because we operate property, various environmental laws also may impose liability
on us for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been
released on our property, including releases unknown to us. These environmental laws and
regulations also could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at
third-party locations where we disposed of or recycled hazardous substances.

With environmental regulations becoming increasingly stringent, our future costs of complying
with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future,
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an_**
**_adverse effect on our financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and are expected to
continue to be, subject to seasonal and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors.
Factors that could result in cash flow fluctuations include the level of sales and the related
margins of those sales, the collection of receivables, the timing and size of purchases of
inventories and related components, the timing of payment of such purchases, and the terms and
timing of payment of payables and accrued liabilities, as well as prevailing economic conditions
and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable
to manage fluctuations in working capital requirements and cash flow, our business, results of
operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable
to make required interest payments on our indebtedness.

If our working capital requirements exceed our other cash flows from operations, we would look
to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our financing arrangements to satisfy
those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on
satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our New Revolving
Credit Facility, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we
are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow sufficient funds to meet
our working capital requirements, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce
expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing indebtedness, or obtain additional
financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell assets or equity or obtain additional
financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty or recall_**
**_claims that may be brought against us._**

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the products that
we sell, particularly the truck spare parts we sell, actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected,
or the use of our product results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.
Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and
incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of the products that we
distribute are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of
that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. We may not be able to pass
these liabilities through to the product manufacturer, whether due to unfavorable supplier
warranties or supplier credit issues. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

33


-----

**_We could face exposure to product liability claims for products that we import from countries_**
**_outside the European Union and sell under our own trademark._**

As a distributor of spare parts, we may be held liable for defective products if we brand products
with our trademark, such as ISOTECH, and present ourselves as the producer of such products or
we distribute products imported from countries outside the European Union. Some of the
products that we distribute are branded with our ISOTECH trademark. In addition, we sell
products imported from countries outside the European Union. By selling products under our
trademark or imported from countries outside the European Union, we may be held liable for
any unforeseen defects in products requiring repair under warranty or recall, which,
notwithstanding possible recourse against the relevant manufacturer and supplier, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, which could adversely affect our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

From time to time we are involved in labor, tax and commercial legal proceedings, the outcomes
of which are difficult to predict. We could become involved in legal disputes in the future which
may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. Although individually these
proceedings do not typically involve substantial amounts, in the aggregate such proceedings or
any increase in the number of such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. As of August 31, 2015, our provision for
litigation amounted to €3.1 million.

In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal proceeding, whether based on a
judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, the costs related to litigation proceedings may be significant. Even if there
is a positive outcome of such proceedings, any negative publicity surrounding assertions against
our business or products could adversely affect our reputation and we may still have to bear part
or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants,
insurance or otherwise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. See “Business—Legal proceedings.”

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in
tax laws, including the basis on which CICE is calculated or the elimination of CICE altogether,
could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In
addition, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject
to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax
authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay
taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our products or services to
track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to certain competition and antitrust laws._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, as well as rules and
regulations of the European Union. We may become subject to legal action or investigations and
proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities for alleged
infringements of antitrust laws, which could result in fines or other forms of liability, or
otherwise damage our business reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Such laws and regulations could limit or
prohibit our ability to grow in certain markets.

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, Bain Capital will indirectly own the majority of the
shares of the Issuer. As a result, our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or
indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and
change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to control the
outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain
circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our obligations as they mature. For example, the
shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the
business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses
that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our shareholders may hold interests in
suppliers or customers of the Group. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an
interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks
to the Noteholders.

### Risks related to the Acquisition

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks._**

On October 14, 2015, BidCo, an entity indirectly controlled by Bain Capital and the indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Seller, to
acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Target (the “Acquisition”). We
currently expect the Acquisition to complete at the end of November 2015. The consummation of
the Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance
by the European Commission and the performance of certain closing actions. The parties to the
Acquisition Agreement will not consummate the Acquisition until the conditions are fulfilled,
which may, potentially, take a number of months and, in exceptional circumstances, significantly
longer. Certain subsidiaries or assets of the Target may have to be sold or spun-off in order for
the parties to the Acquisition Agreement to obtain clearance by the European Commission,
which might lead to the loss of operational synergies and might adversely affect the Group’s
financial condition. Accordingly, the parties may not be able to undertake this transaction in a
timely fashion, without remedies, or at all. Any such remedies may make the Acquisition less
attractive. The realization of any risks related to uncertainties of the Acquisition could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Target Group and will not control the Target Group_**
**_until completion of the Acquisition._**

The Target Group is currently ultimately controlled by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A., a majority
of which is directly or indirectly owned by TowerBrook and Investcorp. The Issuer will not obtain
control of the Target Group until completion of the Acquisition. Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A.
may not operate the business of the Target Group during the interim period from signing of the
Acquisition Agreement until completion of the Acquisition in the same way that we would. Some
information contained in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from public sources and,
in the case of historical information relating to the Target Group, has been provided to us by
Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A., the Target and the Target’s subsidiaries, and the Issuer has relied
on such information supplied to it in its preparation of this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore,
the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus
from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the business. Likewise,
employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition or feel otherwise affected by it, which
could have an impact on work quality and retention.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not be subject to the covenants
described in “Description of the Notes” to be included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot
assure you that, prior to such date, the Target Group will not take any action that would
otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable. Any of
the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control until the completion of the Acquisition could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

-----

**_If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes,_**
**_which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in escrow accounts for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of
our control. Completion of the Acquisition is one of the conditions to the release of the proceeds
from escrow. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or in
the event of certain other events that trigger escrow termination, the Notes will be subject to a
special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds;
_special mandatory redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the_
Notes.

The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory redemption. In the event that the
escrow funds are insufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, plus any such
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, Bain Capital will be required to make an
equity contribution in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial condition of the Target Group, or the terms of the Acquisition or the financing thereof,
between the closing of the Offering and the Completion Date, may have an impact on our
creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a
result thereof.

**_The Acquisition may entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the Target_**
**_Group to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the
Target and its subsidiaries. These counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements
with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders_**
**_of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement. The Acquisition Agreement, however, may be amended and the closing conditions
may be waived at any time by the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes.
Furthermore, any amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may make the Acquisition
less attractive. Any amendment made to the Acquisition Agreement may be materially adverse to
holders of the Notes which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties_**
**_that the Sellers have provided to us under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the sellers have given certain customary representations and
warranties in the Acquisition Agreement related to their shares, the Target and the Target’s
business. We may not be able to enforce any claims against the sellers relating to breaches of
these representations and warranties. The sellers’ liability under the Acquisition Agreement is
very limited. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a
breach of these representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these
losses ourselves.

**_We may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing
due diligence investigations into the Target Group in connection with the Acquisition. We may
learn of additional information about the Target Group that adversely affects us, such as

36


-----

unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any
such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

### Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes

**_The Issuer will be a holding company with no business operations or assets._**

After the Completion Date, the Issuer will be a holding company with no business operations or
assets other than 100% of the ordinary shares of LuxCo 5. The capital stock of the Target will be
indirectly owned by the Issuer and is pledged to secure the New Revolving Credit Facility and the
Senior Secured Notes. The Indenture prohibits the Issuer from engaging in certain activities other
than certain limited activities permitted under “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants—
_Business activities.”_

We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, none of which will provide a
guarantee for the Notes. Consequently, the Issuer will depend on dividends and other
distributions (including any other return on capital) from its direct and indirect subsidiaries to
make payments of principal (or interest in cash) on the Notes. Such subsidiaries are separate and
distinct legal entities, and they will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay the
amounts due under or in relation to the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those
amounts, whether by dividend, distribution or other payments. You will not have any direct
claim on our income from business operations because these operations are undertaken by our
operating subsidiaries. If our operating subsidiaries do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make
payments on the Notes, we do not expect the Issuer to have any other source of funds that
would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes, other than with respect to the first
interest payment.

Agreements governing our debt may from time to time restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to
move cash within our Group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further
taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such
payments.

Even if the Issuer has sufficient cash (received as dividends or otherwise) at any time to satisfy its
obligations under the Notes at that time, the Issuer may, subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, make investments in and make other distributions to its subsidiaries and third parties.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to_**
**_factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our
debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including
the Notes, the Senior Secured Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility. If our future cash
flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities, capital expenditures and planned acquisitions;

   - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these
alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at
such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt
and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may
restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find

37


-----

alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms
that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain
additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able
to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event, borrowings under
other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions
may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts,
including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding
indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could
harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations
to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under
the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from any such
disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or to obtain the funds that
we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize
from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then
due.

**_The Notes are obligations solely of the Issuer, are not guaranteed by any subsidiary and are_**
**_structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities of the subsidiaries of the Issuer._**

After the Completion Date, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all debt and liabilities
of the subsidiaries of the Issuer. As of August 31, 2015, after giving effect to the Senior Secured
Notes Redemption, the Target and its subsidiaries had total financial debt of €287.9 million,
€270.0 million of which was secured indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition,
the Issuer’s subsidiaries are also able to incur up to €40.0 million under our New Revolving Credit
Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements.”

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims
of preference shareholders (if any) of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of such subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims
against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by the Issuer. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those
subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the
Notes will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference
shareholders (if any) of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, none of which will guarantee the Notes. The
subsidiaries of the Issuer may not have sufficient funds to pay (or receive sufficient funds to pay)
all their respective creditors, and you may not receive any payment on the Notes or receive less,
ratably, than the holders of debt of the subsidiaries of the Issuer and other liabilities. Subject to
certain limitations, the subsidiaries of the Issuer will be permitted to incur additional debt and
liabilities in the future under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture which may lead to further structurally senior
indebtedness being incurred in future.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have and, after the issuance of the Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of August 31, 2015,
and as adjusted to give effect to the Offering, our pro forma total financial debt would have
been €526.9 million, of which €239.0 million would have been represented by the Notes. The
terms of the Indenture permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial
additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €40.0 million
under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.”

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations,
including, but not limited to:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our
other debt and liabilities;

38


-----

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal
growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate
purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage
or greater financial resources than we have;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business
and industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business
opportunities; and

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds
or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and
refinance our indebtedness and fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will
depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our
ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We
may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to
service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our non-guarantor
subsidiaries incur will be structurally senior to the Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the
Notes, and such debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the
Indenture contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions
are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. Borrowings under debt instruments that contain crossacceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may as a result also be accelerated
and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances. The
incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described above. In
addition, the Indenture does not prevent us from incurring obligations or entering other
arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables
securitization financings. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital_
_resources.”_

**_We are subject to covenants which limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default_**
**_under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

The Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility contain
covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions
on our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

39


-----

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions,
loans or advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted
subsidiary;

  - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

  - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis;

  - change the “center of main interests” of the Issuer;

  - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

   - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain covenants.” These covenants could limit our ability to finance
future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business
activities that may be in our interest. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions
may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and
industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, in addition to being in
default under the Indenture and the Notes, we could be in default under the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, and the relevant
lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other
fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt.
This would also result in an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes or any other
material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be
insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.

The New Revolving Credit Facility also requires our subsidiaries to maintain a specified financial
maintenance test. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our results
of operations, as well as by events beyond our control, including unfavorable economic
conditions, and we cannot assure you that this test will be met. If an event of default occurs
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders thereunder could terminate their
commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and
other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments,
including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be
accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be
sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding,
including the Notes. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—New Revolving Credit
_Facilities Agreement.”_

**_The value of the pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account securing the Notes may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, and it may be difficult to realize the_**
**_value of the pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account._**

The Notes will be secured on the Completion Date by a first-ranking pledge of all the shares of
the Issuer, a first-ranking pledge over the PECs owed by the Issuer between the Issuer and LuxCo
5 and a first-ranking pledge over the bank account of the Issuer. The value of the pledged shares
and PECs and the amount to be received upon a sale of such shares and PECs will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the shares and PECs in an orderly sale,
the availability of buyers and other factors. The pledged shares and PECs pledge may also secure
additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture. Under certain
circumstances, the security interests of the Issuer over the pledged shares and PECs may be fully
and unconditionally released. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

In addition, the security interest of the Security Agent in the pledged shares will be subject to
practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral.
Accordingly, the Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon the pledged shares.

40


-----

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral securing the_**
**_Notes._**

The obligations under the Notes are secured by the capital stock of the Issuer, the PECs owed by
the Issuer and the bank account of the Issuer. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure
additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Senior HoldCo
Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes will be diluted commensurate_
with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise
any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Senior HoldCo Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes
will have limited remedies or recourse against the Issuer in the event of a default. Moreover,
under the terms of the Senior HoldCo Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer may amend the terms
thereof without the consent of the holders of the Notes if the change is not material or adverse
to the holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Issuer will not amend the Senior
HoldCo Intercreditor Agreement in a manner that is adverse to your interests as holders of the
Notes.

**_The security interest in the pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account securing the Notes_**
**_will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability_**
**_of the Security Agent to take enforcement action with respect to collateral may be limited._**

The security interest in the pledged shares, PECs and bank account that will secure our
obligations under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be
granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide that only the Security
Agent has the right to enforce the pledges of shares, the PECs and the bank account. As a
consequence, holders of Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account
securing the Notes except through the Trustee. In addition, the security interests may be
enforceable upon only upon acceleration of the Notes.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security is subject to mandatory provisions of the
laws of Luxembourg, the jurisdiction in which security over the collateral is taken.

**_The insolvency and administrative laws of Luxembourg may not be favorable to creditors,_**
**_including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the_**
**_Notes or the security interests in the Collateral._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a société anonyme formed under the laws of Luxembourg.
In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of
Luxembourg may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings. The application of
these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_**
**_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuer is required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we
cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would
have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes

41


-----

or that the restrictions in our New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such
required repurchases. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its respective subsidiaries to
allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control,
may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of
default under, or the acceleration of, our New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and other
indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under
such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. If an event constituting a change
of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the
purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer
will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a
change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any
failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Change of control.”

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization,
restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may
adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” (as defined in
the Indenture). In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a
change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon
consummation thereto, a certain consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and its subsidiaries is
met.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there
is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer is organized outside the United States, and its business is conducted entirely outside
the United States. All of the directors of the Issuer are nonresidents of the United States.
Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process in the United
States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer. In addition, because all of the assets
of the Issuer and those of its directors are located outside the United States, you may be unable
to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions
of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions
of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters
with Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Luxembourg of civil
liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Luxembourg.
In addition, the enforcement in Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on
civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject
to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Luxembourg court would have the requisite
power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in Luxembourg on the
basis of U.S. securities law violations. For further information, see “Enforceability of judgments.”

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail
foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor
measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on
the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return
on his or her investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. holders (as defined herein) may also
have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely
affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and
trading of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes have not or will not have been, and are not required to be, registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or
sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in
accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws.
These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of
investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and
other countries comply with applicable securities laws. For further information, see “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as defined herein) will trade in book-entry form only,
and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) will be
issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its
nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes
representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect
of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes
and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must
rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

43


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other
actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be
permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may
not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own
book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-entry, delivery and form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity
of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to
the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer has, pursuant to the Indenture, agreed to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to
trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof within a reasonable period after the Issue Date
and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you
that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the admission to trading on the Global Exchange
Market or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease
to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange, provided that it
will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock
exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no
assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of
the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in
accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with
the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the
secondary market.

**_The Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the stated
interest on the Notes is not unconditionally payable in cash at least annually over the term of the
Notes and, therefore, such interest will not constitute “qualified stated interest.” As a result, U.S.
holders, whether on the cash or accrual method of tax accounting, will be required, at a
minimum, to include the stated interest on the Notes in gross income as OID on a constant yield
to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, potentially in advance of the receipt of
cash payments to which such OID is attributable. For a further discussion, see “Tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations—Interest (OID).”_

**_If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its subsidiaries is or are not permitted to provide sufficient_**
**_funds to the Issuer to pay Cash Interest on the Notes offered hereby, interest on the Notes may_**
**_be paid in PIK Interest rather than cash._**

The Issuer will be required to pay the first and last interest payments on the Notes entirely in
cash. The Issuer will be required to pay each other interest payment on the Notes entirely in cash,
unless the conditions described in this Offering Memorandum are satisfied, in which case the
Issuer will be entitled to pay, to the extent described herein, interest by either increasing the
principal amount of the outstanding Notes or by issuing Notes in a principal amount equal to
such interest as PIK Interest. See “Description of the Notes—Interest.” The Existing Revolving
Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture allow the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s subsidiaries to utilize amounts that would otherwise be available to pay dividends to the
Issuer for other uses, and such uses would reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends
to the Issuer in order to pay Cash Interest on the Notes. The terms of the Notes will not restrict
the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries to use its dividend payment
capacity for such alternative uses. See “Description of certain financing arrangements” and
“Description of the Notes—Interest.” As a result, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will be
required (or able) to make Cash Interest payments on the Notes, and holders of the Notes could
potentially receive no Cash Interest on the Notes for interest periods other than the initial and
final periods. The payment of interest through an increase in the principal amount of the
outstanding Notes or the issuance of Notes will increase the amount of the Issuer’s indebtedness
and would increase the risks associated with the Issuer’s level of indebtedness.

# The Transactions

**_The Acquisition_**

On October 14, 2015, BidCo, an entity indirectly controlled by Bain Capital and the indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire all the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Target (the “Acquisition”). We currently expect the
Acquisition to complete at the end of November 2015. The consummation of the Acquisition is,
however, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including clearance by the European
Commission, and the performance of certain closing actions. If clearance by the European
Commission is not obtained on or prior to the Acquisition Longstop Date, the Acquisition
Agreement will terminate automatically. In connection with the Acquisition, Bain Capital intends
to establish a management equity plan pursuant to which our senior management may hold
ordinary and preferred shares in LuxCo 2. See “Certain relationships and related party
_transactions—Management equity plan.”_

BidCo, public limited liability company (société anonyme) is incorporated and existing under the
laws of Luxembourg, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LuxCo 5, a private limited liability company
(société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo
5, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, a public limited liability company (société
_anonyme) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. The Issuer, in turn, is a_
wholly-owned subsidiary of LuxCo 3, a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité
_limitée) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 3, in turn, is majority_
owned by LuxCo 2, a partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par actions)
incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 2, in turn, is controlled by LuxCo
1, a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing
under the laws of Luxembourg. LuxCo 1, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CaymanCo, a
limited partnership expected to be formed on or prior to the Completion Date in the Cayman
Islands. Each of CaymanCo, LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2, LuxCo 3, the Issuer, LuxCo 5 and BidCo were
acquired or incorporated by Bain Capital as acquisition vehicles for the Transactions. None of
CaymanCo, LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2, LuxCo 3, the Issuer, LuxCo 5 or BidCo has any business operations or
material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and
the Transactions.

**_The Financing_**

The total aggregate financial resources required in order to consummate the Acquisition
(excluding the Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the repayment of the Contingent Value
Instruments, which will be made with cash available at the Target Group (see “—Target Group
_debt repayment”)), and pay for all transaction fees and expenses incurred in connection_
therewith, is expected to be €397.0 million and is expected to be financed (collectively, the
“Financing”) with the following cash and non-cash financial resources:

  - Bain Capital will make a cash contribution of approximately €146.5 million directly to
CaymanCo by way of a subscription for ordinary shares, which will, indirectly through
LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2 and LuxCo 3 (through equity subscriptions and/or PECs), be contributed
to the Issuer (collectively, the “Equity Contribution”);

  - certain other existing investors, including management, the Chairman of the Target Group
and certain Affiliated Distributors, will invest an amount expected to be approximately
€12.7 million in LuxCo 2 by way of a subscription for ordinary shares and preferred shares
(the “Management and Existing Investors’ Investment”); and

  - the Issuer will issue the Notes offered hereby in the aggregate principal amount of
€239.0 million and will contribute approximately €196.7 million of the proceeds thereof,
together with the proceeds of the Equity Contribution and the Management and Existing
Investors’ Investment, to LuxCo 5, which will in turn make a contribution of approximately
€355.9 million to BidCo (in each case, through equity subscriptions).

The proceeds of the Notes will be used as further described under “—Sources and uses of the
_Transactions.”_

As of the Completion Date, we will refinance our Existing Revolving Credit Facility by entering
into the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement which will provide for a New Revolving Credit

46


-----

Facility in the amount of €40.0 million which will be available for general corporate purposes and
working capital needs of the Group. We currently expect that the New Revolving Credit Facility
will remain undrawn as of the Completion Date. See “Use of proceeds.”

We refer to the Acquisition and the Financing collectively as the “Transactions.” See “Use of
_proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of certain financing arrangements” and “Description of_
_the Notes.”_

**_Escrow Account_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross
proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by
the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed proceeds and the consummation of the
Acquisition are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Description of the Notes—
_Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” If the Acquisition is not consummated on or_
prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will
be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a
price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”
In the event that the funds on deposit in the Escrow Account are insufficient to pay the special
mandatory redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
Bain Capital will be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required
to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between Bain Capital and the
Issuer. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption” and
“Risk factors—Risks related to the Acquisition—If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied,
_the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return_
_you expect on the Notes.”_

**_Target Group debt repayment_**

The Seller has agreed in the Acquisition Agreement to use its best efforts to cause:

  - the Target to repay the Contingent Value Instruments in full for an estimated cash amount
of €5.3 million (with any amount payable in excess of €4.7 million to be treated as
“leakage” under the Acquisition Agreement and to be deducted from the equity purchase
price for the Target) on or about the Completion Date using cash on hand; and

  - the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to redeem €30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of 103%, plus accrued interest thereon (the
“Senior Secured Notes Redemption”), on or prior to the Completion Date using cash on
hand.

Following the Senior Secured Notes Redemption, €270.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes will remain outstanding.

47

# Use of proceeds

We estimate that the gross proceeds (after original issue discount) from the sale of the Notes will
be €237.8 million. We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering, together with the
Equity Contribution, the Management and Existing Investors’ Investment, and cash on hand at
the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Target, to: (i) fund the consideration payable
for the capital stock of the Target purchased in the Acquisition; (ii) pre-fund cash interest
payments due on the Notes offered hereby (the “Cash Coupon Pre-Funding”); (iii) fund the
Senior Secured Notes Redemption; (iv) repay the Contingent Value Instruments; and (v) pay the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including estimated fees and
expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions
are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on
several factors, including accrued interest on debt being repaid, differences from our estimates
of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions. Any changes in these amounts may affect
the amount of the Equity Contribution.

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also
hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, we generated 90.6% of our revenue in France and 9.4% of our revenue in
Poland. We believe that as of December 31, 2014, we held a market share of approximately 23%
in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. The IAM has demonstrated
resilience in recent years and currently benefits from advantageous long-term trends. Our scale
provides us with significant purchasing power with aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our
extensive network throughout France, which we have expanded with the ACR Acquisition, allows
us to deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our whollyowned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these parts,
equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for light
vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and operate
under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to
garages represented 77% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended August 31,
2015, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 23% of our revenue in
France over the same period. As of August 31, 2015, we had a network of 38 wholly-owned
distributors and 42 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out
of 492 distribution sites, comprising 323 wholly-owned and 169 affiliated distribution sites, which
are supplied either by our four warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle
collision repair parts and one for truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use
a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure the efficient management of our
supply chain and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery
schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44 distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 125,000 endcustomers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages. Approximately

54


-----

3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an affiliate
program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in return our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred
distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from central
purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in the
markets in which we operate.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, we generated revenue of €1,211.6 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €86.1 million.

Of the €847 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2015, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 53.8%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
15.3%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.1%; and
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.7%. The remaining €250.5 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015 was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Key factors affecting our results of operations

The following are key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and
financial condition and liquidity during the eight months ended August 31, 2014 and 2015 and
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 or which we expect will significantly affect
(or continue to affect) our results of operations in the future.

**_Factors related to our industry_**

_Dynamics of the aftermarkets for spare parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair_

The following factors may affect the amount of light vehicle parts sold in France in any given
period:

  - Size of the car park. The size of the car park impacts the size of the aftermarket for spare
parts for light vehicles, trucks and collision repair. The size of the car park in the markets in
which we operate is impacted by population size (which has grown to a limited extent in
France over the last five years), consumer spending power, the use of public transportation
(which has increased in recent years) and the rate at which new cars are introduced and
old cars are retired from the car park. Notwithstanding the decrease in new light vehicle
purchases as a result of general economic conditions, the size of the car park in France has
remained stable over the last five years and is expected to grow by 0.8% by 2020 based on
the Roland Berger analysis.

  - Average age of the car park. The decrease in new light vehicle purchases combined with
the stable size of the car park has resulted in an increase in the average age of the car park
in France. In general, older cars require more repair and maintenance services and spare
parts than younger cars, and as a result an increase in the average age of the car park can
have a positive impact on our operations. According to Roland Berger, the average age of
the car park in France increased from approximately 7.6 years in 2000 to approximately 8.7
years in 2014, and Roland Berger expects this trend to continue. The age of the car park is
also impacted by the sales price and production quality of new light vehicles, because both
high sales prices and increasing production quality (which generally enables vehicles to run
longer without repair or replacement) generally lead vehicle owners to delay the purchase
of new light vehicles.

  - Postponement of certain light vehicle repairs. Despite a stable car park size and the
increasing age of light vehicles, we believe that during an economic downturn, some of

55


-----

our end-customers postpone light vehicle repairs and maintenance inspections and repairs
and maintenance due to their diminished spending power. Though key maintenance
inspections and repairs cannot be postponed for a prolonged period, we believe that the
IAM for light vehicles in France has been affected by this temporary postponement of
repairs during recent economic downturns.

  - Miles travelled. Light vehicles that are frequently used and driven many miles typically
require more repair and maintenance services and replacement of spare parts than light
vehicles that drive fewer miles. We believe that general economic conditions in Europe,
particularly in France, have affected the spending power of light vehicle owners and led to
a decrease in miles travelled per light vehicle. Government incentives that encourage
carpooling and the use of public transportation also impact miles travelled. The average
number of miles travelled per light vehicle in France decreased by 0.6% from 2013 to 2014.
The annual mileage per car has, however, begun to stabilize. Roland Berger expects the
mileage to remain stable in France due to anti-pollution regulations (e.g., alternate traffic
circulation) and carpooling initiatives. On the other hand, the fleet mileage for the Heavy
Vehicles segment is expected to grow by 1.3% per annum by 2020, mainly driven by the
recovery in Europe of the manufacturing sector and the associated transportation needs.

  - Preference of independent garages versus manufacturers’ dealers’ garages. We believe
that the diminished spending power of our consumers and the increasing age of the car
park have encouraged some customers to rely more on garages operating in the
independent segment, as opposed to the manufacturers’ dealers’ segment. Certain
customers prefer, however, particularly during the warranty coverage period, to have their
light vehicle serviced in a manufacturers’ dealers’ garage, due to the link between the
manufacturers’ dealers’ garage and the original light vehicle manufacturer. On average,
the IAM provides more competitive pricing than the OES. Manufacturers’ dealers’ garages
tend to use original vehicle manufacturer parts that have higher prices, given that the sale
of spare parts represents a large portion of the vehicle manufacturer’s gross margin, while
our IAM parts are often sold at lower prices.

  - Increased variety in light vehicles. The number of brands and models of light vehicles in
France has been steadily increasing in recent years, which has resulted in an increase in the
variety of spare parts ultimately ordered by our customers. This increase in the variety of
spare parts benefits large, integrated distributors such as us because we have the scale to
stock a wide variety of spare parts. As a result, we can serve as a one-stop shop for our
end-customers, who increasingly require a wider range of products. We believe that this
increase in brands and models of light vehicles may adversely affect manufacturers’
dealers’ distributors, which focus on single brands, and small-scale IAM distributors, which
are less able to offer a wide variety of spare parts. We also believe that the increase in
brands and models of light vehicles may lead to further consolidation among smaller IAM
distributors, thereby further benefiting established, large and integrated distributors such
as us.

The factors described above have generally had a positive impact on our results for the periods
under review, and we believe have generally increased our ability to maintain stable earnings
and cash flow.

_Technological trends in our industry_

Our results are impacted by the changing technological trends in our industry and our ability to
respond to such trends. Technological advancements in the light vehicle and truck market, such
as the increased number of driver assistance systems, control devices and other electronic
components, have resulted in sophisticated repair processes and related spare parts. The
increased use of technology in the manufacturing of light vehicles, trucks and spare parts has also
led to an extended lifespan of key light vehicle and truck components, such as exhaust systems,
tires, brakes and motor oil. These trends have adversely affected our operations in certain of our
business segments because light vehicle and truck spare parts tend to wear out less frequently,
which in turn extends maintenance service cycles and leads to lower demand for spare parts and
repair services.

Furthermore, due to ongoing technological developments, independent garages are required to
acquire the appropriate technical expertise in newly developed components and gain access to

56


-----

the tools, instruments and parts that such technological developments demand, which may result
in an increase in demand for maintenance and repair services provided by manufacturer dealers’
garages with the necessary technical expertise. Similarly, given the extended lifespan of spare
parts, certain light vehicle manufacturers have extended their new light vehicle warranties for
eight years or more and provide long-term service programs to customers. Notwithstanding this,
in many cases, decreasing volumes have been offset by increased prices for technologically
advanced spare parts and complex repair services. In addition, certain technological
advancements may require entire modules or systems to be replaced in certain types of light
vehicles, as opposed to discrete parts, thereby increasing replacement costs. We have also
developed various market-leading IT services for our customers, including easily accessible
websites and support and training services, in order to keep our customers up-to-date with the
latest technological developments.

_General economic conditions_

Our business and the demand for certain products that we distribute are affected by general
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. While our business and the IAM in
France as a whole have generally proven resilient during economic cycles, each of our business
lines responds differently to general economic conditions. Our light vehicles business line tends
to demonstrate resilience during weaker general economic conditions, as light vehicle owners
switch to cheaper independent garages from manufacturers’ dealer garages and the average age
of the car park increases, providing our business with an element of counter-cyclicality, although
we may initially experience slower sales due to destocking by distributors and garages and
vehicle owners delaying repairs. On the other hand, our truck parts distribution business line
shows a higher correlation with general economic cycles, with miles driven by trucks, and
therefore demand for truck parts, increasing as general economic conditions improve. Our
collision repair business tends not to be significantly affected by general economic cycles.

In addition, certain of our products, such as brake pads, belts and other critical parts, tend to
exhibit inelastic demand, even during difficult economic conditions, while more discretionary items,
such as accessories for light vehicles and trucks, tend to be impacted more by the economic climate.

_Regulation_

The market for the supply and distribution of spare parts is affected by regulatory changes,
including those that govern access to the spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors and those
that seek to impact vehicle safety and other driver behaviors.

_New BER_

In recent years, the market for the supply and distribution of spare parts has been generally
liberalized as a result of EU regulatory changes. This development has improved access to the
spare parts aftermarket for IAM distributors. The light vehicle and truck wholesale sector in the
European Union is currently regulated by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”), which
was adopted in 2010 and replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) A key aim of
the New BER is to ensure fair competition in the light vehicle and truck wholesale sector. In
general, we believe that the current regulatory framework is favorable to our operations and
ensures (i) full access for independent spare parts manufacturers and garages to the technical
information needed to ensure effective competition within and between the IAM and the OES,
(ii) customers’ rights to engage independent garages throughout the life of the light vehicle with
no warranty limitations, (iii) the unrestricted sale of spare parts in the IAM and (iv) resellers’
rights to use private brands and logos for spare parts sales. According to industry experts, the
IAM increased its share of the total aftermarket in France between 2008 and 2011, growing at a
CAGR of 1.9%, while the OES increased by 0.5% over the same period.

_Traffic laws and policy_

The overall market for collision repair in France has been affected by a decline in collisions as a
result of the increased enforcement of and publicity surrounding traffic laws. We have, however,
increased our market share in this declining market by strengthening our relationships with car
insurance companies, providing collision parts at lower prices and improving our supply chain for
the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision repair.

_Social charges_

In addition, our results are also impacted by government policies in France relating to payments
for certain social charges, such as the Fillon Law and CICE.

Fillon Law

We are required to pay social security contributions for our employees that cover illness,
maternity leave, incapacity, retirement and death. Pursuant to the Fillon Law, we benefit from
reductions in such social security contributions in respect of wages for those employees whose
salaries are less than 1.6 times the French statutory minimum wage (salaire minimum
_interprofessionnel de croissance) (the “SMIC”). Pursuant to an August 2014 amendment in_
effect from January 2015, the decrease in required social security contributions applies to
(i) contributions for illness, maternity leave, incapacity, retirement and death, (ii) contributions
for family allowance (allocation familiales), (iii) contributions for the National Fund for Housing
Assistance (Fonds National d’Aide au Logement) (“FNAL”), (iv) contributions of solidarity for the
autonomy and (v) contributions for accidents at work and work-related diseases (limited by a
rate of up to 1%). The amount of this reduction is limited for 2015 to 27.95% of the gross salary
of such employees (for companies with less than 20 employees which are subject to a FNAL
contribution of 0.1% of the total salary paid to the employees) and to 28.35% of the gross salary
of such employees (for companies with 20 employees or more which are subject to a FNAL
contribution of 0.5% of the total salary paid to the employees) and, in any case, cannot exceed
the total amount of the rates of the concerned contributions. The amount of this reduction
increases inversely in proportion to gross salary for such employees (i.e., the reduction is lowest
for a gross salary that is just under 160% of the statutory minimum wage, but highest for a gross
salary that is equal to the statutory minimum wage). Our employee costs are therefore impacted
by changes in this law. Pursuant to a January 2011 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary was
calculated on a full-year basis (instead of the monthly statutory minimum wage, as it previously
had been calculated). Pursuant to a January 2012 amendment of the Fillon Law, gross salary is
deemed to include overtime and bonuses. The effect of these amendments has been to decrease
the amount of reductions that we were entitled to apply to our social security contributions for
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Pursuant to an August 2014 amendment to
the Fillon Law applicable since January 2015, gross salary is deemed to include the salary for
break times and time spent dressing and undressing.

The availability of such reductions in social security contributions is also subject to our compliance
with French regulations relating to mandatory annual salary negotiations with employee
representatives. If we do not comply with such regulations, the reduction in social security
contributions could be up to 10% less than those to which it would normally be entitled. We also
lose this entitlement altogether (i.e., the amount of the discount in the social security
contributions is reduced by up to 100%) if we do not comply with the requirement to undertake
salary negotiations with employee representatives for three consecutive years.

CICE

In December 2012, a new tax credit for encouraging competitiveness and jobs (Crédit d’Impôt
_pour la Compétitivité et l’Emploi) (“CICE”) was adopted as part of an overall stated French_
government policy to improve the competitive position of companies in France. Pursuant to CICE
rules, French companies will receive a tax credit of 4% of the gross salaries paid to certain
employees for 2013 and 6% of the gross salaries of such employees for 2014 and subsequent
years. The amount of CICE is calculated on the basis of gross salaries paid to such employees in
the course of the calendar year for employees whose gross salary is less than or equal to 2.5 times
the SMIC. Pursuant to CICE rules, an employee’s gross salary is calculated on the basis of such
employee’s normal working hours plus such employee’s overtime hours, salary for break times
and time spent dressing and undressing.

Under normal circumstances, CICE can be offset against corporation tax due with respect to the
year during which the relevant salaries have been paid. If the amount of the corporation tax
charge is less than the amount of CICE, the balance can be carried forward for the next three
fiscal years and thus be offset against corporation tax charges with respect to such next three
fiscal years. If after these three fiscal years, the amount of CICE has not been fully utilized, the

58


-----

remaining amount can be refunded by the French tax authorities if requested. Companies under
a safeguard plan are entitled to obtain an immediate refund of the amount of CICE which cannot
be offset against corporation tax. Therefore, these companies are not required to wait until the
end of the three-year period to ask for a refund.

We have assigned our CICE claim for the years 2013 and 2014 to Bpifrance under a factoring
agreement in order to achieve cash flow benefits immediately for approximately 85% of current
year CICE and we may prefinance 85% of CICE with respect to following years. The remaining
portion of CICE can be offset against corporation tax for the next three fiscal years and
eventually be reimbursable at the end of this three-year period as described above.

In light of ongoing state budgetary pressures in France, the French government may decide at
any time to change its policy and limit the application of CICE, for example, by changing the basis
upon which CICE is calculated, or eliminate it altogether. If the French economy improves, the
government may also decide that CICE is no longer needed to increase employment and enhance
the competitiveness of the French economy and as a result may choose to repeal the law that
established it for budgetary or other reasons. There can be no assurance therefore that we will
continue to be able to benefit from CICE. Any changes to CICE, including changes in the
conditions or requirements companies must satisfy in order to claim CICE or the accounting
treatment thereof, may result in the decrease or elimination of the positive impact of CICE on
our results of operations. Finally, certain commercial partners of the Target Group, such as
customers, suppliers and concession grantors, may increase price pressure on the Target Group in
order to share the benefit of CICE, which may have an impact on our revenue and margins and as
such decrease or eliminate the impact of CICE.

**_Factors specific to our business_**

_Acquisitions and disposals_

External growth through acquisitions has contributed to the overall growth of our business. We
acquired Enssemble, a network of light vehicle spare parts distributors, in 2012 and FPLS, a truck
spare parts distributor, in 2013. In December 2013, we acquired Rougon Queyrel, a distributor of
spare parts for light vehicles in southeastern France, and in April 2014 we acquired ACR, a
specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light vehicles. These acquisitions have impacted
our results, and limit the comparability of our results from period to period. We intend to
continue to selectively pursue acquisitions to further expand our network in order to increase our
market share. By further participating in the industry-wide consolidation of the market and
integrating acquired entities into our Group, we believe that we can increase our purchasing
power with suppliers, thereby generating better margins. We also intend to expand our
geographic coverage in the French truck IAM, in part by making selective, local acquisitions. Since
January 1, 2012, we have acquired seven companies and disposed of two companies.

_Operational improvement measures_

Our results are impacted by operational improvement measures that we implement. Since 2009,
we have developed and continue to implement operating strategies designed to increase
revenues, reduce costs and capital expenditures and improve margins. Specifically, we have:

  - Installed a new management team. We introduced a new, experienced management
team who were capable of implementing our strategic vision and driving profitability over
the last five years.

  - Implemented a Profit Improvement Plan. The PIP was initiated in 2009, and since the
beginning of its implementation through the eight months ended August 31, 2015, our
EBITDA has increased by approximately €60 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2009. The primary focus of the PIP was to reduce the cost of management
and administration at our subsidiaries by implementing shared services, limiting employee
costs in our local businesses, and minimizing transportation and logistics costs by
optimizing truck routes and making greater use of central distribution facilities. We also
sought to improve productivity by eliminating certain loss-making businesses. The PIP also
focused on improving the way our central purchasing departments make purchases, in
addition to refining our enterprise resource platform (“ERP”) to allow us to analyze

59


-----

rebates across our business. As part of such improvements, we segmented purchases
among different product groups, gradually concentrated purchases of core mechanical
repair parts among selected suppliers and used our Group-wide purchasing power to
negotiate improved rebates for purchases of fast-moving spare parts and spare parts with
a dominant supplier.

  - The new law dated March 17, 2014 (the “Hamon Law”) added an additional provision to
Article L. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code pursuant to which, in the case of a monthly
invoice, the payment period may not exceed forty-five (45) days as from the date of the
invoice. We were able to fully adapt our working capital cycle to such revised payments
terms and to pass some further changes in such payment terms on to our customers.

  - Revised margins applied to distributors. Prior to 2009, we charged different margins to
wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors. We have since moved
to a uniform margin for wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.
We have also implemented a loyalty program with both our wholly-owned and our
affiliated independent distributors to encourage them to purchase spare parts and
equipment and tools from our central purchasing departments. As members of our loyalty
program, all our distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by typically
agreeing to purchase at least 70% of their spare parts from us, driving our volumes.

We believe that one of our most important competitive advantages has been our ability to use
the purchasing power derived from our large size and specialized warehouse and logistics
systems. Through our logistics process, we have been able to obtain more favorable supply terms
from suppliers than those available to many other participants in the light vehicle and truck
aftermarket. As part of the PIP, we sought to reduce the number of suppliers we use, and thus
we have concentrated larger volumes of purchases among fewer suppliers, resulting in improved
purchasing terms and conditions for product groups that we distribute. In order to preserve our
flexibility in obtaining favorable prices in the market, we do not generally enter into long-term
supply contracts. We believe this purchasing policy has generally resulted in lower costs.

Since the beginning of 2014, we have implemented a new five-year business plan, which we
review and adjust annually. As part of this business plan, we have developed our business-tobusiness sales of spare parts for light vehicles by increasing the efficiency of our logistics
platforms and our supply model, and by improving our customer service with more efficient call
centers. We also intend to further develop over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts
through over-the-counter loyalty programs, specific marketing efforts and dedicated sales force
training. We intend to further develop our truck business by implementing a new sales strategy,
including redefining our product assortment to better suit local market expectations, launching
new sales tools, such as the eBook sales IT system, and increasing our interaction with our main
customers through a product offering tailored to such customers.

_Competition_

Our results are affected by the level of competition and the types of competitors operating in the
light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket. Our main competitors in the markets in which we
operate are other IAM light vehicle and truck spare part distributors, autocenters and fast-fitter
chains. The IAM is currently undergoing a period of consolidation, particularly in France. While
we are participating in this trend of consolidation, we expect that we will face larger and betterfunded competitors in the future as a result.

We also compete against online light vehicle spare parts retailers which mainly compete with us
on the basis of price. We believe that an increasing number of customers compare prices on the
internet before making a purchase and generally choose products with the most competitive
price. We realized at an early stage that the internet offered innovative opportunities for light
vehicle and truck spare parts distributors. As a result, we created the Autossimo online light
vehicle repair and maintenance portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online truck repair and
maintenance portal in 2001 in order to address the demand for ordering spare parts online. For
the year ended December 31, 2014 and the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, approximately
€113 million and €122 million, respectively, of our revenue by both our wholly-owned
distributors and affiliated independent distributors was generated from the sale of light vehicle
spare parts through our online portal, Autossimo.

In addition, we also compete with manufacturers’ dealer garages such as Peugeot and Renault.
Manufacturers’ dealer garages typically specialize in light vehicles from newly-purchased to
three-year-old vehicles, and capture a large share of light vehicle and truck repairs covered by
warranties, as well as a more limited share of light vehicle and truck repairs aged four years and
older. However, certain vehicle manufacturers have, however, extended their new light vehicles
warranties to up to eight years and cover longer-term maintenance and repairs.

### Explanation of key income statement line items

The following is a brief description of the revenue and expenses that are included in the line
items of our income statement.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is generated through primarily the sale of products and, to a lesser extent, services to
our customers. We recognize revenue from the sale of products when we deliver goods to the
customer. We recognize revenue from services in the period in which services are rendered. We
deduct customer rebates and bonuses and other taxes on sales.

**_Cost of goods for sale_**

Cost of goods for sale includes the purchases of goods, supplier rebates, change in inventories
and net allocation to inventories depreciation.

**_Personnel costs_**

Personnel costs include wages, social security contributions, profit-sharing plans and pension
costs.

**_Other purchases and external expenses_**

Other purchases and external expenses relate to non-direct operating costs, including rental
expenses, shipping expenses, maintenance and repair costs, legal and other fees, IT expenses,
advertising expenses, subcontracting costs, travelling and other expenses.

**_Taxes_**

Taxes include taxes on salaries (mainly taxes in respect of vocational training), social construction
tax (cotisation foncière des entreprises), social solidarity contribution (contribution sociale de
_solidarité—a tax calculated based on a percentage of net sales), and other taxes other than_
income taxes.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA represents net income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax, financial
items (net), share of income of associates, other income/(expenses) from operations and
depreciation/amortization expense.

**_Depreciation/amortization expense_**

Depreciation/amortization expenses represent the depreciation of property, plant, equipment
and intangible assets (excluding goodwill and our brands, such as AD), which are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. Property, plant, equipment and intangible assets are tested for
impairment when there are indications of impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in
other expenses from operations when the recoverable amount of an intangible asset is lower
than its carry value.

**_Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations generally relate to one-off events or other events
outside of our ordinary business. Other income and expenses from operations can include gains
and losses on the disposal of operations, of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets,
as well as costs relating to provisions and expenses relating to restructuring, employee and tax
disputes, and impairment losses/reversals.

61


-----

**_Financial income and expenses_**

Financial income includes income from financial investments, foreign exchange gains and other
financial income. Financial expenses include interest on external loans and bank overdrafts
payable by the Group, discounting of borrowings and debt, expenses related to financial
instruments and to finance leases, foreign exchange losses and other financial expenses.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes consist of current tax expense, CVAE (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoute´e des
_Entreprises) and changes in deferred tax assets._

### Description of other key financial indicators

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain items that we consider to be nonrecurring or exceptional in nature, or otherwise not reflective of the ongoing performance of our
business. See the table set forth in “Summary—Summary consolidated financial and other
_information” for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss) from_
continuing operations for the eight months ended August 31, 2014 and 2015 and the years
ended December 31, 2012, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.

### Restatements

Since January 1, 2013, we have applied amendments to the existing standard IAS 19R “Employee
Benefits.” Since these amendments were applied retroactively, our audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, have been restated solely for
comparative purposes. The most significant change relates to the recognition of all actuarial
gains or losses. This new version of the accounting standard also resulted in a change in the
accounting treatment of past service costs which can no longer be deferred and must
immediately be recognized. This leads to the immediate recognition of all the actuarial variances
and past service costs in our balance sheet liabilities. Actuarial variances will be fully recognized
through other comprehensive income/(expense) directly in equity and past service costs in period
net income. These amendments also define the return on assets as the discount rate used to
measure the benefits liability. Financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for
the year ended December 31, 2012 is based on the restated information included in our financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Since January 1, 2015, we have applied the interpretation IFRIC 21 which clarifies that the
obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant
legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. Since these amendments were applied
retroactively, our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for
the eight months ended August 31, 2014 reflect the effects of the application of IFRIC 21.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €42.1 million, or 5.5%, from €764.1 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2014, to €806.2 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

In France, revenue increased by €40.3 million, or 5.8%, from €690.9 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €731.2 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €30.7 million, or 5.8%, from
€532.0 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €562.7 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of ACR

-----

on April 7, 2014, which contributed €22.2 million of additional revenue in the eight months
ended August 31, 2015 compared to the eight months ended August 31, 2014, as well as organic
growth, partly offset by the disposal of a former wholly-owned distributor (SOFAR), which
contributed €6.3 million in the eight months ended August 31, 2014.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors increased by €9.5 million, or 6.0%,
from €158.9 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €168.4 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the disposal of a former
wholly-owned distributor to an independent distributor and the increased number of insurance
agreements and improved distributors’ sales management.

In Poland, revenue increased by €1.7 million, or 2.3%, from €73.3 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014 versus €75.0 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. The
increase was due to a lower end-pricing strategy which has contributed to an increase in sales
volume despite difficult market conditions.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €21.4 million, or 4.5%, from €473.4 for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €494.8 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. The
increase in the cost of goods for sale was primarily due to the increase in the purchases of goods
by €36.8 million, or 6.6% as a result of an increase in revenue of 5.5%, partly offset by increases
in supplier rebates of €15.4 million, due to a renegotiation of rates with our suppliers as part of
our PIP. Mainly as a result of these higher supplier rebates, cost of goods for sale as a percentage
of revenue decreased from 61.9% for the eight months ended August 31, 2014, to 61.4% for the
eight months ended August 31, 2015.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €3.0 million, or 1.9%, from €161.0 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €164.0 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. Personnel
costs as a percentage of revenue decreased from 21.1% for the eight months ended August 31,
2014 to 20.3% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. The decrease in the personnel costs
as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the disposal of a wholly-owned distributor to an
independent distributor, partly offset by the increase in the cost of a temporary workforce of
€1.4 million, or 36.9%, as a result of increased activity due to improved market conditions.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €3.8 million, or 4.5%, from €84.8 million for
the eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €88.6 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015. This increase in other purchases and external expenses is mainly due to increasing shipping
expenses of €1.4 million and IT expenses of €1.3 million. Others purchases and external expenses
as a percentage of revenue remained stable from 11.1% for the eight months ended August 31,
2014 to 11.0% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

_Taxes_

Taxes slightly decreased by €0.3 million, or 4.3%, from €7.0 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2014, to €6.7 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. In 2015, taxes
mainly comprised French vocational training tax of €1.5 million (compared to €1.6 million in
2014), a social construction tax of €1.4 million (compared to €1.4 million in 2014), a social
solidarity contribution of €1.9 million (compared to €1.8 million in 2014) and taxes other than
income taxes of €1.9 million (compared to €2.2 million in 2014).

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 2.5%, from €11.9 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €12.1 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €0.5 million, or 31.3%, from €1.6 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €2.1 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015. This increase was primarily due to the reversal of provisions for restructuring for
€0.8 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

65


-----

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €1.2 million, or 26.7% from €4.5 million for the
eight months ended August 31, 2014, to €5.7 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2015. The increase is mainly due to expenses related to the closure of several distribution sites,
particularly in relation to the restructuring of the heavy vehicles segment in the Paris region.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income decreased by €10.9 million, or 96.5%, from income of €11.3 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2014 to €0.4 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. The
Income for the eight months ended August 31, 2014 was due to an adjustment in the fair value
of our Contingent Value Instruments for €10.9 million for the eight months ended August 31,
2014.

Financial expenses increased by €3.0 million, or 20.8%, from €14.4 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €17.4 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. This
increase was due to an adjustment of €3.5 million in the fair value of our Contingent Value
Instruments for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €7.0 million, from a €9.2 million income tax credit for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014 to a €2.2 million income tax expense for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015. In the eight months ended August 31, 2015, income tax comprised CVAE for
€4.4 million (compared to €3.7 million in 2014), current income tax expense of €1.5 million
(compared to €1 million in 2014) and a deferred tax credit of €8.1 million (compared to a
deferred tax expense of €14.0 million in 2014). This €5.8 million variation in deferred taxes was
due to the decision to use a deferred tax credit in the eight months ended August, 31 2015.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €16.2 million, or 42.0%, from €40.2 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €57.1 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 5.3% for the eight months ended August 31, 2014, to 7.1% for
the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €16.4 million, or 44.5%, from €39.5 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2014, to €55.3 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 5.7% for the eight months ended August 31, 2014 to
7.6% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partly
due to our acquisition of ACR on April 7, 2014, which contributed €2.9 million of additional
adjusted EBITDA for the eight months ended August 31, 2015 compared to the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, and generated a progressive synergies ramp-up, as well as cost
efficiencies as a result of the PIP.

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €0.5 million, from €0.7 million for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014, to €1.3 for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA
margin from our Polish business increased from 0.1% for the eight months ended August 31,
2014, to 0.2% for the eight months ended August 31, 2015. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was
mainly due to a lower end-pricing strategy which has contributed to an increase in sales volume
and to staff costs and rental expenses reductions.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €32.3 million, or 2.8%, from €1,137.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €1,169.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In France, revenue
increased by €33.3 million, or 3.3%, from €1 023.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
to €1,056.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors increased by €45.5 million, or 5.9%, from
€770.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €815.8 million for the year ended

67


-----

December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the ACR Acquisition, which contributed
€47.6 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, and the acquisition of
Rougon-Queyrel on December 30, 2013, which contributed €14.3 million to our revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was partly offset by the disposal in September 2014
of Sofar, which contributed €7.2 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to €9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the effect of these
acquisitions and disposals, revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by
€14.5 million, or 1.9% on a like-for-like basis, primarily due to difficult economic conditions
which impacted our truck parts for maintenance and repair product line.

Revenue from sales to our affiliated independent distributors decreased by €12.1 million, or
4.8%, from €253.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €241.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of Rougon-Queyrel,
previously one of our affiliated independent distributors which became one of our wholly-owned
distributors.

In Poland, revenue remained stable with €113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013
compared to €112.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 despite difficult market
conditions resulting in lower sales volumes.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €10.5 million, or 1.5%, from €710.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €721.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to the ACR Acquisition and the acquisition of Rougon-Queyrel.

Cost of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 62.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily
due to higher rebates from our suppliers following the integration of ACR.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €6.4 million, or 2.7%, from €239.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €245.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to increased wages and social contributions following the ACR Acquisition. This
increase was partially offset by overall headcount reductions from 6,321 employees for the year
ended December 31, 2013 to 6,315 for the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding ACR, and by
a positive impact of €2.5 million relating to CICE for the year ended December 31, 2014,
compared to CICE for the year ended December 31, 2013, due to an increase in CICE tax credit
from 4% to 6%.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €6.9 million, or 5.5%, from €126.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2013, to €133.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in our transportation costs as a result of the ACR
Acquisition.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 11.1% for the
year ended December 31, 2013 to 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to additional commercial costs related to a major customer and network event.

_Taxes_

Taxes decreased by €0.4 million, or 4.1%, from €9.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, to €9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31,
2014, taxes mainly comprised French vocational training tax of €2.3 million (compared to
€2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013), a social construction tax of €2.0 million
(compared to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013), a social solidarity contribution
of €2.0 million (compared to €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013) and taxes other
than income taxes of €3.1 million (compared to €3.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2013).

68


-----

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense increased by €2.0 million, or 12.3%, from €16.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2013, to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily due to a higher level of software and licenses depreciation and the
depreciation of the acquired customer database of ACR.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €4.7 million, or 63.5%, from €7.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to €12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase
was primarily due to a reversal of impairment of €9.0 million on our AD brand for the year ended
December 31, 2014, following a decrease in the discount rate applied in the yearly valuation of
our brand, from 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 10.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €7.8 million, or 70.9%, from €11.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2013, to €18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase was primarily due to the negative impact of difficult economic conditions on the assets
of our truck parts for maintenance and repairs product line, resulting in a goodwill impairment
of €5.8 million and an impairment charge of €3.0 million on property, plant and equipment.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income increased by €0.6 million, or 5.5%, from €11.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was due
to an adjustment in the fair value of our Contingent Value Instruments following our improved
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Financial expenses increased by €12.6 million, or 140%, from €9.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in the payment of interest from €4.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, mainly due to the
payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes.

_Income tax_

Income tax decreased by €19.4 million, from a €17.6 million income tax expense for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to a €1.8 million income tax credit for the year ended December 31,
2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax comprised CVAE of €5.4 million
(compared to €5.3 million in for the year ended December 31, 2013), current income tax expense
(which remained stable) at €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and a deferred tax
credit of €9.0 million (compared to a deferred tax expense of €10.5 million in for the year ended
December 31, 2013). This €19.5 million increase in deferred tax was mainly due to additional
deferred tax assets recognized on tax losses carry forward.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €13.8 million, or 24.9%, from €55.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013, to €69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013, to 5.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2014.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €13.8 million, or 25.7%, from €53.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to €66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2013, to 6.4% for the year
ended December 31, 2014. This increase was mainly due to synergies from the integration of ACR
and tight cost controls in our light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair and light vehicle
parts for collision repair product lines (our EBITDA margin increased from 3.0% for the year
ended December 31, 2013, to 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014).

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA remained stable at €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Despite lower sales volumes, Adjusted EBITDA margin remained stable at approximately 1.5% for
the year ended December 31, 2014, due to lower staff costs and lower rents for our sites in Poland.

On a pro forma basis to give effect to the ACR Acquisition as if such acquisition would have
occurred on January 1, 2014, our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2014 would
have been approximately €74.3 million.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €52.9 million, or 4.9%, from €1,084.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, to €1,137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In France, revenue
increased by €46.9 million, or 4.8%, from €976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012,
to €1,023.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Revenue from sales to our wholly-owned distributors increased by €39.8 million, or 5.4%, from
€730.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, to €770.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of Enssemble on July 9,
2012 (which contributed €62.6 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013,
compared to €31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012), the acquisition of FPLS on
January 1, 2013 (which contributed €24.4 million to our revenue in for the year ended December 31,
2013), the acquisition of the RPDC group on January 31, 2013 (which contributed €2.6 million to our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013), and the acquisition of CAMI on June 30, 2013
(which contributed €1.1 million to our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013). Excluding
the effect of these acquisitions, revenue from sales by our wholly-owned distributors decreased by
€19.1 million, or 2.6% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting lower performance of certain of our
distribution sites and weaker market conditions at the beginning of 2013.

Revenue from sales by our affiliated independent distributors increased by €7.1 million, or 2.8%,
from €246.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, to €253.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the resilient performance by our affiliated
independent distributors despite weaker market conditions, and to several acquisitions made by
our affiliated independent distributors in 2013.

In Poland, revenue increased by €6.0 million, or 5.6%, from €107.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, to €113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was
mainly due to the reorganization and the profit improvement plan implemented by our new
management team in Poland.

_Cost of goods for sale_

Cost of goods for sale increased by €20.8 million, or 3.0%, from €689.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, to €710.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Cost of goods for
sale as a percentage of revenue decreased from 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012, to
62.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in cost of goods for sale as a
percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher supplier rebates following a renegotiation
with our suppliers as part of our PIP.

_Personnel costs_

Personnel costs increased by €14.7 million, or 6.6%, from €224.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, to €239.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Personnel costs as a
percentage of revenue increased slightly from 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012, to
21.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. These increases were primarily due to increases in
wages and social contributions of €12.7 million and €1.3 million, respectively, mainly as a result
of our acquisitions of Enssemble in July 2012 and FPLS in January 2013. This increase in wages and
social contributions were partly offset by overall headcount reductions as part of our PIP,
particularly at our French wholly-owned distributors and in Poland, together with the positive
impact of €4.9 million relating to CICE.

_Other purchases and external expenses_

Other purchases and external expenses increased by €4.4 million, or 3.6%, from €121.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2012, to €126.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in our rents for the year ended December 31, 2013,
resulting from the addition of 38 rented sites following our acquisitions of Enssemble in July
2012 and FPLS in January 2013.

Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of revenue slightly decreased from 11.2%
for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 11.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This
decrease was primarily due to the closing of certain under-performing distribution sites and the
renegotiation of certain of our leases in connection with our PIP.

71


-----

_Taxes_

Taxes increased by €1.5 million, or 18.3%, from €8.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2012, to €9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31,
2013, taxes mainly comprised French vocational training tax of €2.4 million (compared to
€1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012), a social construction tax of €2.1 million
(compared to €1.9 million in for the year ended December 31, 2012), a social solidarity
contribution of €1.8 million (compared to €1.7 million in for the year ended December 31, 2012)
and other taxes of €3.3 million (compared to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012).
This increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of vocational training we provided.

_Depreciation/amortization expense_

Depreciation/amortization expense increased by €1.2 million, or 7.9%, from €15.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2012, to €16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to the amortization of assets in Poland in 2013, while no amortization
had been recognized in the corresponding period in 2012. Those assets were fully impaired in
2012 and the impairment charge was released in 2013 as a result of the improvement of our
operations in Poland following management initiatives.

_Other income from operations_

Other income from operations increased by €4.0 million, or 117.6%, from €3.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2012, to €7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to a reversal of impairment of €2.9 million on our Polish property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets after improved performance, following the full
impairment of these assets for the year ended December 31, 2012.

_Other expenses from operations_

Other expenses from operations increased by €3.8 million, or 52.8%, from €7.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2012, to €11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to higher restructuring costs due to headcount reductions and the
closing of certain distribution sites in connection with our PIP.

_Financial income and expenses_

Financial income increased by €8.7 million, from €2.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2012 to €11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was mainly due to the
fair value adjustment of €10.7 million on our Contingent Value Instruments for the year ended
December 31, 2013.

Financial expenses decreased by €2.3 million, or 20.4%, from €11.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 to €9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was
primarily due to a reduction in our cost of debt following amortization payments of €10.0 million
of our former senior equity loan in June 2012 and €5.0 million of our former senior facility loan
in June 2013.

In addition, we recorded a negative net foreign exchange variance of €0.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013, compared to a positive net foreign exchange variance of €0.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2012. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to
fluctuations in the Polish złoty exchange rate on our local overdraft and working capital
borrowings denominated in Polish złoty.

_Income tax_

Income tax increased by €9.8 million, from a €7.8 million income tax expense for the year ended
December 31, 2012 to a €17.6 million income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.
In 2013, income tax comprised CVAE of €5.3 million (compared to €4.7 million in 2012), current
income tax expense of €1.8 million (compared to €0.3 million in 2012) and a deferred tax expense
of €10.5 million (compared to a deferred tax expense of €2.8 million in 2012).

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €7.7 million, or 16.1%, from €47.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, to €55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Adjusted EBITDA
margin increased from 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012, to 4.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2013.

In France, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €4.5 million, or 9.2%, from €49.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012, to €53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Adjusted
EBITDA margin increased from 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012, to 5.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2013. This increase in our Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower costs
of goods for sale as a percentage of revenue, mainly due to increases of our supplier rebates
following a renegotiation with our suppliers as part of our PIP, as well as a reduction in other
purchases and external expenses relative to revenue, resulting primarily from the closure of
certain under-performing wholly-owned distribution sites and the renegotiation of certain of our
lease agreements as part of our PIP. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partly offset by an
increase in personnel costs relative to revenue, mainly due to increases in wages and social
contributions over this period, as well as an increase in our headcount following our acquisitions
of Enssemble in July 2012 and FPLS in January 2013. The impact of acquisitions on our personnel
costs was partly offset by overall headcount reductions as part of our PIP, particularly at certain
of our wholly-owned distributors, together with the impact of €4.9 million relating to CICE.

In Poland, Adjusted EBITDA increased by €3.2 million, from a loss of €1.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012 to a gain of €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from negative 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012, to
positive 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to lower
personnel costs, mainly due to headcount reductions, and an increase in supplier rebates, both
resulting from the actions of our new management team in Poland.

**Liquidity and capital resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash
requirements of its business, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital
expenditures, operating losses, acquisitions, and contractual obligations and commitments. Our
principal sources of liquidity have been our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated
from operations, factoring facilities, bank overdraft facilities and finance leases.

We expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be our existing cash and cash equivalents,
cash generated from operations, any borrowings under our working capital and bank overdraft
facilities, including our €40.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility, factoring facilities and finance
leases.

Our financial condition and liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, influenced by a
variety of factors, including:

  - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

  - the level of our outstanding indebtedness, and the interest we are obligated to pay on
such indebtedness, which affects our finance costs;

  - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements;

  - our ability to continue to borrow funds from banks;

   - our level of acquisition activity; and

  - our capital expenditure requirements.

Our cash requirements are expected to consist mainly of the following:

  - paying operating costs and working capital;

  - funding capital expenditures;

  - servicing indebtedness; and

  - paying taxes.

73


-----

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, future borrowings under our
New Revolving Credit Facility and potential future borrowings under debt securities will be
adequate to meet our anticipated general liquidity needs and debt service obligations, we
cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet
these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient
to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or other debt
when due. If our cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected or our capital
expenditure requirements exceed our projections, we may be required to seek additional
financing, which may not available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to
arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depends on numerous factors, including
general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions,
capital markets, restrictions in instruments governing our debt and our general financial
performance. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Risk factors—Risks related to
_our indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our_
_indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other_
_actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

_Cash flows from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities is mainly impacted by changes in working capital and other
items with a cash effect, in addition to changes in net income and cancellations of unrealized
income and expenses, the elimination of financial expenses and income with a cash effect, and
the elimination of income tax.

The monthly variations of the net cash flows from operating activities are largely impacted by
the seasonality of our business. In particular, our working capital is typically high (resulting from
higher inventories and receivables) in July and October, which explains the much lower level of
net cash flow from operating activities during these months.

75


-----

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €17.2 million (or 2.1% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €12.2 million) offset by
an unfavorable change in working capital, mainly inventory and trade receivables and payables
due to an increase in activity and seasonality effects.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €5.1 million (or 0.7% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2014, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after
adjustments for non-cash income and expenses offset by an increase in working capital due to
higher inventory and other receivables and payables.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €38.7 million (or 3.3% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after adjustments
for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €18.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2014) partly offset by an unfavorable change in working capital as a result of a
lower level of CICE receivables, excluding the impact of the ACR Acquisition.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €30.5 million (or 2.7% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the positive impact of net income after adjustments
for non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €16.3 million), which was partly offset
by an unfavorable change in working capital due to higher receivables as a result of an increase
in sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Net cash from operating activities amounted to €39.0 million (or 3.6% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a positive impact of net income after adjustments for
non-cash income and expenses (mainly depreciation of €15.1 million) and a decrease in working
capital, due to lower receivables as a result of the decrease in activity at the end of 2012.

_Working capital_

Working capital comprises trade working capital and other receivables and payables. Our trade
working capital comprises inventories, trade payables and trade receivables. Other receivables
and payables primarily comprise tax and employee benefit payables.

Our inventory levels are affected by the seasonality of our activity, our product range strategy
and our ability to manage our stocks locally. The change in trade payables and receivables is
mainly linked to the seasonality of our business. The level of receivables may also be impacted by
our ability to recover payments from our customers.

Our working capital requirements are affected by the seasonality of our business. Our typical
working capital cycle is primarily driven by the build-up of inventory during the first semester,
with our working capital reaching its peak in July and October, and a decrease of our inventory
in the second semester, with our working capital reaching its trough in November.

We generated an increase in working capital of €28.4 million for the eight months ended August
31, 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase of €10.8 million in inventories resulting from an increase
in activity and the seasonal build-up of inventories in August, (ii) an outflow of €17.1 million in
net other receivables and payables mainly due to a seasonal low point of personal charges
payables in August and the build-up of the CICE receivables and (iii) a cash outflow of €0.5
million of the net trade receivables and trade payables (mainly of ACR). Excluding the impact of
ACR, there was a cash inflow of €2.8 million mainly as a result of the seasonal increase in both
suppliers’ rebates (€14.5 million) and customers’ rebates (€10.5 million), which usually occurs at
this time of the year. Net working capital was also significantly affected by the implementation
of the Hamon Law. See “—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Factors specific to our
_business—Operational improvement measures.”_

Our working capital increased by €25.7 million for the eight months ended August 31, 2014,
primarily due to (i) an increase in inventories of €12.1 million resulting from an increase in the
seasonal build-up of inventories in August, (ii) an outflow of €15.3 million of the net other
receivables and payables mainly due to a seasonal low point of payables in August and the buildup of the CICE receivables and (iii) a cash inflow of €1.7 million of the net trade receivables and
trade payables (mainly of ACR). Excluding the impact of ACR, there was a cash inflow of €12.4
million mainly as a result of the seasonal increase in both suppliers’ rebates (€12.6 million) and
customers’ rebates (€5.3 million), which usually occurs at this time of the year.

76


-----

We experienced an increase in working capital of €9.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2014, which primarily reflected a decrease of €9.7 million in trade payables, an increase of
€4.8 million in other receivables and payables, and an increase of €4.2 million in inventories
partly offset by the decrease of €9.0 million in trade receivables. The difference between the
balance sheet and the cash flow statement variations in working capital is mainly due to the ACR
Acquisition. Excluding the impact of ACR, this cash outflow is mainly due to the build-up of CICE
receivables.

We experienced an increase in working capital of €7.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, primarily due to an increase of €8.0 million in trade receivables following the increase in
sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.

We experienced a decrease in working capital of €6.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2012, which primarily reflected a decrease in trade receivables of €21.1 million, partly offset by a
decrease in trade payables of €15.2 million, due to a decrease in trading activity. Moreover, the
decrease in inventories of €2.4 million is primarily due to improvements in inventory
management and the weaker market conditions in 2012.

_Other items_

Other items with a cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of €3.3 million for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €4.3 million. Other items with a
cash effect related solely to the income tax paid of €3.2 million for the eight months ended
August 31, 2014, mostly as a result of the CVAE of €3.7 million. Other items with a cash effect
related solely to the income tax paid of €7.2 million for the year ended December 31 2014,
mostly as a result of the CVAE of €5.4 million. Other items with a cash effect related solely to the
income tax paid of €7.3 million for the year ended December 31 2013, mostly as a result of the
CVAE of €5.3 million and an overestimation of income tax prepayments.

the periods indicated.

_Capital expenditures_

Capital expenditures consist solely of the acquisition of fixed assets. Our capital expenditures
include the further expansion of our operations and the maintenance of our existing operations.
In particular, our capital expenditure on tangible assets mainly relates to purchases of shelving
and machinery for the transport and storage of products in our warehouses, as well as purchases
of light vehicles and trucks. Our capital expenditure on intangible assets mainly relates to the
capitalization of new functional development costs of our ERP, the purchase of software licenses
relating to management and financial reporting, technical light vehicle and truck databases and
inventory management.

We have a “capex light” business model, and consequently are not required to make significant
capital investments in our business. Our capital expenditures were, on average, 1.6% of our
revenue and 32% of our Adjusted EBITDA in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

We expect an increase in our investment in capital expenditures for the years ending
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, mainly due to the automation of our logistics
platform. We do not anticipate any other significant capital expenditure investments in the year
ending December 31, 2015.

77


-----

Capital expenditures increased by €5.8 million, to €16.8 million (or 2.1% of revenue) for the eight
months ended August 31, 2015, from €11.0 million (or 1.4% of revenue) for the eight months
ended August 31, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the automation of our logistics
platforms and the acquisition of warehouses.

Capital expenditures decreased by €1.1 million, to €18.7 million (or 1.6% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2014, from €19.8 million (or 1.7% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2013. This decrease was mainly due to decreased investments in the year ended
December 31, 2015.

Capital expenditures increased by €3.9 million, to €19.8 million (or 1.7% of revenue) for the year
ended December 31, 2014, from €15.9 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the renovation of several distribution sites
and the implementation of our new AD branding.

Capital expenditures remained stable at €15.9 million (or 1.5% of revenue) for the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased investments in IT, particularly expenditures
associated with the development costs of the ERP, our data center and the Autossimo website,
which were partly offset by lower expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations.

_Business acquisitions and advances paid_

Business acquisitions and advances paid mainly relate to external acquisitions, and advances paid
in relation to those acquisitions. The amount of the acquisition is presented net of cash (or
overdraft) held by such acquired entity.

Business acquisitions and advances paid amounted to €54.9 million (7.2% of revenue) for the
eight months ended August 31, 2014. They solely consist of the ACR Acquisition in April 2014.
There were no business acquisitions in the eight months ended August, 31 2015.

Business acquisitions and advances paid increased by €39.4 million, to €52.5 million (or 4.5% of
revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2014, from €13.1 million (or 1.2% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2013. These business acquisitions and advances paid primarily include
the acquisition of ACR.

Business acquisitions and advances paid decreased by €4.5 million, to €13.1 million (or 1.2% of
revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2013, from €17.6 million (or 1.6% of revenue) for the
year ended December 31, 2012. These business acquisitions and advances paid primarily include
the negative cash position of FPLS paid in December 2012 but consolidated as of January 1, 2013,
the acquisition of the Rectification du Pas-De-Calais group, the acquisition of Comptoir Auto
Marine Industrie and the acquisition of Rougon-Queyrel. For the year ended December 31, 2012,
advances paid amounted to €3.8 million, primarily due to the advances paid for the acquisition of
FPLS (which was consolidated beginning on January 1, 2013).

### Credit Management Policy

We have adopted credit management procedures adjusted to the characteristics of the market
and of our customers in order to reduce the risk of exposure and to attempt to allow prompt and
proactive management of our business. The proactive customer credit risk monitoring activities
start by grouping consumers based on their type, the duration of credit, the existence of previous
financial difficulties or notifications and of the possible existence of legal or ongoing bankruptcy
procedures. Financial assets are recorded in the financial statements net of the write-off based
on the risk of breach by the counterparty, which is determined based on the available
information regarding the customer’s solvency.

### Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about financial risk

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. We monitor
and manage these risks as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which
recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce their potential adverse
effects on our results of operations.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The euro is the functional currency in which our financial statements are presented. Our
subsidiary in Poland generates currency in Polish złoty, and for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015 Polish złoty represented 9.4% of our revenue. We do not hedge this exchange
rate risk.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risks due to our need to finance our operations as well as to
utilize our available liquidity. Fluctuations in market interest rates may have a negative or a
positive impact on our financial results by indirectly influencing the repayment of loans and
investments. Following the Transactions, our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be
primarily composed of the Notes (which will pay both Cash Interest and PIK Interest at a fixed
interest rate), the Senior Secured Notes (which have a fixed interest rate) and the New Revolving
Credit Facility (which borrowings will have an interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR).

We evaluate our exposure to changes in interest rates on a regular basis and may decide to
manage the foregoing risks through financial derivatives, according to the directives contained in
the “Interest rate risk management policy” we have adopted. Notwithstanding our potential use
of hedging instruments, unexpected changes in interest rates could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

### Off-balance sheet arrangements

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements. For a description of certain
commitments and guarantees that we have given to third parties in connection with our
financing arrangements and other ordinary course rental and other obligations, see note 28 to
our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for
the eight months ended August 31, 2015.

### Other financial obligations: Pension obligations

For a description of certain pension plans and obligations, see note 21 to our unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the eight months ended
August 31, 2015.

### Critical accounting policies

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various
estimates and assumptions that affect the results we report. Such estimates or assumptions are
based on our historical experience and currently available information, including expectations of
future events that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
significantly from such estimates in light of the uncertainty surrounding the assumptions and
conditions upon which the estimates are based. The following are significant accounting policies
determined on the basis of such estimates and assumptions for which changes during a financial
period could involve a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether there is any indication that a nonfinancial asset might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the four-year EBITDA plan
for each Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) as defined by us. For purposes of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs most likely to benefit from the synergies of
the business combination and to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by us. The CGUs
correspond to subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries that are included in the same operating
segment and that generate cash flows largely independent from those generated by other CGUs.
The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result
following the changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there is an indication of
impairment, we carry out impairment tests. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed
separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that
show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that we will
have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The calculation
of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized requires management to estimate
how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits, with
regard to tax management strategies.

**_Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions regarding discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates.

**_Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

# Industry

_This discussion contains market and competitive position data from industry publications and_
_from surveys or studies conducted by third-party sources._

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment in France, where we generated 90.4% of our revenue for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2015. We also hold a strong regional position in the Polish light
vehicle IAM, where we generated 9.6% of our revenue over the same period. With over 50 years
of experience in the market, we believe that as of December 31, 2014, we held a market share of
approximately 23% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. The IAM is
the independent aftermarket for spare parts used in the maintenance and repair of light vehicles
and trucks. These spare parts include mechanical parts, electrical parts and electronic
components, body parts (including headlights), assembly parts, tires, oils and lubricants, car paint,
other chemical products and accessories. The light vehicle aftermarket is relatively complex
compared to other industries, due to the large number of market participants with varying
business models.


In general, the light vehicle aftermarket can be divided into the following two segments:

  - original equipment suppliers aftermarket segment (“OES”), which is operated through a
distribution network directly connected to car manufacturers and generally consists of
authorized garages managed by car dealers; and

  - the IAM, which is operated by independent distributors and garages, which are not
connected to car manufacturers and typically service all of the vehicles operating on the
road without making a distinction between brands.


Original equipment suppliers and IAM suppliers sell their products to wholesalers and distributors
which often operate on a national level. Regional and local wholesalers frequently buy these
products from national wholesalers and distributors for further sale to garages, body shops, fastfitters and car centers.

The following chart provides an overview of the interaction of the key participants in the IAM in
France, from the manufacturer level to the garage and repair point level, and we have illustrated
our own position within the purchasing and distribution segments below as an example.

The following are the key participants in the IAM in France:

  - Purchasing group: A department making purchases on behalf of a larger group of
distributors. Consolidated purchases made through a purchasing group increase
bargaining power with suppliers and enable greater discounts on purchased parts.

  - Distributors. In the French OES, distribution is generally carried out by authorized resellers
of the manufacturers that supply authorized dealers. In the IAM, distribution is carried out


83


-----

by independent distributors that supply products, depending on the specifics of the
geographic area in which they operate, to wholesalers (which, in turn, supply garages,
body shops, fast-fitters and car centers) or directly to garages, body shops, fast-fitters and
car centers, depending on the specifics of the geographic area in which they operate.

  - Garages (including body shops). Garages are either authorized by a car manufacturer or
manufacturers, or operate independently and do not maintain any relationship with a
particular manufacturer. Authorized garages generally specialize in the OES and, in
general, solely offer products and services relating to the vehicles produced by the
manufacturer to which they are connected. Consequently, authorized garages only provide
services in relation to a limited range of vehicles. By contrast, independent garages that
operate in the IAM generally offer services and repairs on all vehicles, without
distinguishing between vehicle manufacturers and models.

There are often exceptions to the supply chain described above, largely due to the expectations
of end-customers that garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers obtain light vehicle spare
parts in a timely manner. For example, larger garage networks or specialist repair center chains
often source particular light vehicle spare parts from an external wholesaler. In some cases,
authorized dealerships may source spare parts externally.

### Differentiating factors between the IAM and the OES

Key factors considered by end-customers when deciding to use the services provided by the IAM,
rather than the OES, include:

  - the wide range of products offered by IAM operators and the segment’s competitive
pricing; and

  - the timely execution of maintenance and repair services, which generally favors IAM
operators due to the efficiency of the IAM distribution network and the capacity of
independent garages to quickly obtain spare parts that they may not have in stock.

### Development of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France

We participate in the aftermarket value chain as a business-to-business distributor of spare parts
for light vehicles and trucks, generating 90% of our revenue in France. As of December 31, 2014,
Roland Berger valued the French light vehicle aftermarket at €8,055 million, of which the IAM
contributes approximately 52%, or approximately €4,190 million, and the OES contributes 48%,
or approximately €3,866 million.

-----

The aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles in France is characterized by stable growth and
has historically been resistant to downturns, including the recent economic downturn.

Between 2009 and 2014, the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles increased at a CAGR of
0.6% while the French IAM grew by 0.95%. Roland Berger expects the French aftermarket to
grow at a CAGR of 0.5% and the French IAM to grow by 1.15% between 2014 and 2020.

### Key factors influencing growth of the aftermarket for spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in France

The IAM may, in the near future, remain stable or experience low levels of growth due to
a combination of factors, including increased demand as a result of the age, mileage and
composition of vehicles on the road, technological developments, and the range of services
rendered and products offered by the IAM compared to the OES.

**_Number of vehicles on the road_**

The total number of vehicles on the road is a key factor affecting the development of the spare
parts aftermarket. As of December 31, 2014, there were approximately 37.8 million light vehicles
on the road in France. Growth in the number of vehicles on the road is measured by the number
of new registrations over a certain period, minus the number of vehicles retired during that
period. The number of new registrations is influenced by a variety of factors, including the
purchasing power of the overall population, the density level of light vehicles on the road and
the availability of government incentives to purchase new vehicles. The number of light vehicles
on the road has remained relatively stable in recent years, with a CAGR 2009–2014 of 0.5% and,
according to Roland Berger, is expected to continue to remain stable in the near future, with a
CAGR 2014–2020 of 0.4%.

The following table sets forth the development of French vehicles on the road from 2000 to 2020:

**2000** **2005** **2009** **2014** **2020**

_French vehicles on the road . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 33.2 35.6 36.8 37.8 38.6
_Period CAGR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ — 1.4% 0.8% 0.5% 0.4%

**_Age of light vehicles on the road_**

Roland Berger divides light vehicles on the road into five categories of age: (i) zero to four years;
(ii) five to nine years; (iii) ten to 14 years; and (iv) 15 years and older. As of December 31, 2014,
the average age of light vehicles on the road in France was 8.7 years (expected to reach 9.4 years
in 2020). In addition, the number of light vehicles on the road aged more than four years was
69.0% of the total vehicles on the road in 2014.

We believe that consumer preferences for services and repairs vary depending on the age of the
vehicle in question. Despite the fact that the quality of service and the validity or duration of a
vehicle warranty is generally not compromised when using services and parts sourced from
independent garages, consumers who own vehicles that are four years old or less typically use
authorized garages operating in the OES to perform related maintenance and repair services
because their vehicles are typically covered by manufacturer warranties. We believe that
consumers who own vehicles that are more than four years old increasingly prefer to have their
cars serviced by independent garages. This is primarily due to the expiration of car warranties
and the fact that these particular consumers are more concerned with the pricing of services and
parts, which is typically a favorable development for the IAM. As a result, spare parts supplied for
vehicles over five years old constitute the majority of the IAM.

**_Composition of vehicles on the road_**

The composition of vehicle makes and models on the road is largely determined by the
purchasing power and preferences of end-customers. Such composition influences the frequency
of maintenance and repair services, the average price of spare parts used for repairs and the
overall development of the IAM.

85


-----

Vehicles on the road in France are generally of high quality. As a result, the average price of
spare parts is higher. We expect the IAM to capture a higher share of the market as the average
age of vehicles in France increases.

Furthermore, between 1980 and 2013, the share of car brands other than PSA and Renault, as a
percentage of the light vehicle fleet in France, increased from 17% to 34%. This increasing
heterogeneity in vehicle brands has led to an increased need to be able to offer a wide variety of
spare parts. This increasing complexity tends to benefit the IAM over the OES, due to its efficient
management of the proliferation of different brands, ability to address a larger and more diverse
customer base, and its greater economies of scale.

**_Miles travelled_**

The need for maintenance and repair services is directly related to the age of and number of
miles travelled by vehicles. For example, an increase in fuel prices or, for example, the adoption
of government incentives to use public transportation, or disincentives to travel by car, may have
an impact on the number of miles travelled over a certain period. Over the past five years, the
number of miles travelled in Europe has been negatively impacted by a weak economic climate
among other factors, though, according to the Roland Berger report, the number of miles
travelled in France has begun to stabilize. The average mileage is expected to remain stable until
2020 due to anti-pollution regulations (e.g., alternate traffic circulation) and carpooling
initiatives. On the other hand, the fleet mileage for the heavy vehicles segment is expected to
grow by 1.3% per annum until 2020, mainly driven by the recovery in Europe of the
manufacturing sector and the associated transportation needs.

**_Technological developments and prices_**

Technological developments in the light vehicle industry generally lead to an increase in the
quality of vehicles available, as well as the components used in car manufacturing becoming
more complex. While an increase in quality generally results in an increase in the durability of
vehicle components, it also tends to lead to an increase in the average price of spare parts.
Furthermore, there is a general trend towards the use of modules in automobiles, which are
more expensive to replace than single parts.

The increasing complexity of vehicle components can also impact the growth potential of the
IAM, because service providers need to develop their vehicle expertise and technical capabilities
to continue to provide minimum maintenance and repair services.

**_Regulation_**

The European regulatory environment directly affects the European light vehicle aftermarket,
and has been generally favorable towards IAM operators in recent years. The general trend has
been towards granting the IAM full access to the market by limiting restrictions on independent
manufacturers selling automobile parts to authorized or independent distributors and garages,
and end-customers. In addition, the current regulatory framework requires that the OES grant
IAM operators full access to relevant technical information and permits only certain limitations
on vehicle warranties.

**_New distribution channels_**

With the development of web-based databases, both garages and end-customers are able to
identify, source and order required spare parts via the internet. This relatively new distribution
channel will be key in retaining and capturing market share going forward, because customers
will formulate their purchasing decisions while engaging with these internet databases.

### Changes in vehicle use in France

Roland Berger estimates that, as of December 31, 2014 there were approximately 37.8 million
light vehicles on the road in France, corresponding to a density of approximately 570 vehicles per
1,000 inhabitants. Roland Berger estimates that 69.0% of vehicles on the road are more than four
years old. One of the primary reasons for this high number of relatively new vehicles derives from
government incentives introduced in France, designed to encourage the purchase of new cars.

86


-----

We believe that the decline in purchasing power of the population and the absence of
government incentives for new car purchases will lead to an increase of the average age of
vehicles on the road in France, resulting in growing demand for IAM products and services.

Roland Berger estimates that the number of vehicles on the road in France will be fairly stable at
a CAGR of 0.4% from 2014 until 2020.

### Competitive landscape of the IAM in France

Distribution in the French IAM is highly fragmented and includes various national distributors, as
well as regional and local distributors with a more limited market share. We are the largest
independent distributor in France, holding a market share of approximately 23% in terms of
revenue in the fragmented French light vehicles IAM as of December 31, 2014.

# Business

### Overview

We are the leading distributor of aftermarket spare parts for light vehicles and trucks in the
independent aftermarket segment (“IAM”) in France, with over 50 years of experience. We also
hold a strong regional position in the Polish light vehicle IAM. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, we generated 90.6% of our revenue in France and 9.4% of our revenue in
Poland. We believe that as of December 31, 2014, we held a market share of approximately 23%
in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. The IAM has demonstrated
resilience in recent years and currently benefits from advantageous long-term trends. Our scale
provides us with significant purchasing power with aftermarket spare parts suppliers, and our
extensive network throughout France, which we have expanded with the ACR Acquisition, allows
us to deliver a broad range of parts on a timely and efficient basis.

We distribute parts and other products in four business lines across the French IAM: light vehicle
parts for maintenance and repair; light vehicle parts for collision repair; truck parts for
maintenance and repair; and equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We
distribute a broad portfolio of products in each of our four business lines, featuring
approximately one million commonly used spare parts from over 300 suppliers.

We are an integrated distributor, with an advanced supply chain and distribution system. Our
system in France is organized around central purchasing departments, which buy aftermarket
spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then sold to our whollyowned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. These distributors sell these parts,
equipment and tools to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages for light
vehicles and trucks and car centers (“garages”), some of which are affiliated with us and operate
under our brands, such as AD (“branded garages”). Sales by our wholly-owned distributors to
garages represented 77% of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended August 31,
2015, and sales by us to affiliated independent distributors represented 23% of our revenue in
France over the same period. As of August 31, 2015, we had a network of 38 wholly-owned
distributors and 42 affiliated independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out
of 492 distribution sites, comprising 323 wholly-owned and 169 affiliated distribution sites, which
are supplied either by our four warehouses (two for light vehicle parts, one for light vehicle
collision repair parts and one for truck parts) or through direct shipments from suppliers. We use
a customized information technology (“IT”) system to ensure the efficient management of our
supply chain and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery
schedules. In Poland, we operate three warehouses and 44 distribution sites.

The spare parts and equipment and tools that we distribute are sold to more than 125,000 endcustomers in France, a significant portion of which are independent garages. Approximately
3,200 of such garages operate under our brands, such as AD, and participate in an affiliate
program through which they receive enhanced service and support from us, and in return our
wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated as their preferred
distributor of spare parts. Our extensive network, spanning the supply chain from central
purchasing to branded garages, has enabled us to develop a highly recognized brand in the
markets in which we operate.

Our leading market position, large-scale operations and centralized purchasing departments
provide us with significant purchasing power, which we use to negotiate volume rebates with
our suppliers. We pass on a portion of these rebates to both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors in France. As members of our loyalty program, our affiliated
independent distributors receive the benefit of our volume rebates by agreeing to purchase at
least 70% of their spare parts from us, thereby driving our volumes. In 2015, we renewed our
contract with our affiliated independent distributors for an additional seven-year term.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, we generated revenue of €1,211.6 million and
Adjusted EBITDA of €86.1 million.

Of the €847 million in revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors in France for the
twelve months ended August 31, 2015, light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair accounted
for approximately 53.8%; light vehicle parts for collision repair accounted for approximately
15.3%; truck parts for maintenance and repair accounted for approximately 14.1%; and

88


-----

equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair accounted for approximately
16.7%. The remaining €250.5 million of our revenue in France for the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015 was generated by sales to affiliated independent distributors.

### Our strengths

**_Stable and resilient light vehicle and truck aftermarket_**

The light vehicle and truck spare parts aftermarket is one of the most profitable sectors of the
light vehicle and truck value chain. Demand in the light vehicle spare parts aftermarket is
affected by the number of cars on the road (the “car park”) and the average age of and miles
driven by these cars. The aftermarket in the countries in which we operate has proven resilient
during recent economic downturns, when new car sales tend to decline. For example, the French
light and heavy commercial vehicle aftermarket (at distribution level) increased by 2.4% and
1.0% between 2010 and 2014, respectively. This resilience is due in part to several beneficial
trends which we believe will continue in the medium term, such as a stable car park size, a
continuing increase in the average age of the car park, increasingly complex and technologically
advanced vehicle parts, and advantageous regulatory schemes in the jurisdictions in which we
operate. For example, the slowdown of new car sales in the markets in which we operate has led
to an increase in the average age of the car park, resulting in a growing share of cars beyond the
manufacturer warranty period and in need of repair and maintenance. Independent garages
sourcing IAM-provided spare parts create value for owners of such beyond warranty period cars
looking for an alternative to expensive manufacturer dealers’ garages.

**_Leading distributor in the profitable French independent aftermarket sector_**

We are the leading distributor of parts for light vehicles and trucks in the IAM in France, with
over 50 years of experience. As of December 31, 2014, we held an estimated market share of
approximately 23% in terms of revenue in the fragmented French light vehicle IAM. Our leading
position in the IAM, our well-recognized brand and our extensive distribution network provide us
with a strong platform to deliver a broad range of spare parts, equipment and tools on a timely
and efficient basis. We also enjoy a strong regional position in the light vehicle IAM in Poland
through our wholly-owned distributors in southern Poland.

**_Vertically integrated distribution system serving a diversified customer base_**

_Vertically integrated distribution system_

Our distribution system is vertically integrated, enabling us to frequently and rapidly distribute a
large assortment of parts, at a lower cost than smaller operators, and to maintain high levels of
product availability for customers. Each of our business lines in France has an extensive
distribution network organized around our central purchasing departments, four specialized
national warehouses and distribution sites spread throughout France. We also arrange for the
direct supply of spare parts and equipment and tools from suppliers, and these deliveries are
handled separately from our logistics platform. For those parts not shipped directly from the
supplier, we use a customized IT system to ensure the efficient management of our supply chain
and distribution system by tracking product availability, stock levels and delivery schedules. Our
distribution system is also capable of making frequent, rapid deliveries and has been designed to
efficiently handle high volumes, thereby reducing costs, increasing product availability and,
ultimately, driving increased customer loyalty. Furthermore, we have organized our distribution
system taking into account each business line’s specific characteristics in order to optimize our
operational flexibility and efficiency, thereby increasing our ability to provide high levels of
service to our customers. For example, we separated our light vehicles and trucks spare product
lines into two distinct business units in order to optimize their supply chains and capitalize on
their respective efficiencies.

Our vertically integrated distribution system and extensive network of distributors and garages
provide us with a competitive advantage in France over smaller operators because smaller
operators lack our purchasing power, large on-hand stock and service levels. We are also a
founding partner of the AD International purchasing network, one of the largest European
purchasing networks of independent distributors for spare parts, which further enhances our

89


-----

purchasing power, allows us to obtain rebates and complements our leading position in France
by giving us access to best practices of other AD International partners abroad. We believe that
the advantages of our vertically integrated distribution system are difficult to replicate because
of the significant time and resources that would be required to reproduce our existing
infrastructure.

_Diversified customer base_

Our vertically integrated distribution system enables us to deliver high levels of service to a large
customer base of light vehicle and truck garages (which include independent garages, body
shops, fast-fitters, fleet garages and car centers). We serve more than 125,000 end-customers in
France, including our approximately 3,200 branded garages. We service our customers through
both our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, 77% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to garages through our
wholly-owned distributors, and 23% of our revenue in France was generated by sales to affiliated
independent distributors that are members of our loyalty program. We believe that our efficient
distribution network and our ability to deliver a wide variety of parts across a broad network on
a timely and efficient basis has contributed to increased customer loyalty and enabled us to
develop and maintain our large and diverse customer base. In general, the end-customers
targeted by our wholly-owned distributors and our affiliated independent distributors do not
overlap due to the commercial arrangements that we have in place with our affiliated
independent distributors. In addition, we are focused on developing new customer segments and
have set up a separate sales department to target insurance clients in order to strengthen our
commercial relationships with these companies and increase our share of the collision repair
market.

**_High-quality service based on extensive product portfolio, highly efficient operations and_**
**_customized IT systems_**

Quality of service in the IAM distributor market is closely tied to the range of parts on offer,
efficient and effective order execution, timely delivery and responsive customer service. We offer
an extensive product portfolio of approximately one million commonly used spare parts from
over 300 suppliers, including a new product line for windscreens. We believe that our suppliers
view us as a key channel through which they are able to supply parts for the IAM, which allows
us to negotiate improved pricing and purchasing terms from a diverse range of suppliers. This is
because we are one of the few distributors in our market with the scale, warehouse logistics,
distribution network and expertise to be able to acquire, stock and distribute a large number of
spare parts, equipment and tools for an increasingly complex market. The number of car and
truck brands and models in the car park continues to increase and, as a result, the related
assortment of car and truck spare parts increases each year. We believe that our extensive
product portfolio, combined with our extensive range of services, make us attractive to the
growing number of multi-brand garages that are moving away from single-brand, manufacturerspecific dealers.

Our logistics platforms are well invested and allow us to operate industry-leading distribution
networks. As of August 31, 2015, Logisteo, our central warehouse from which we distribute spare
parts for light vehicle repair and maintenance, was the largest independent logistics platform for
light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France, with over 20,000 square meters of
storage space that stored over 57,000 spare parts references of 140 brands. It supplies 492
distribution sites, comprising 323 wholly-owned and 169 affiliated distribution sites, and employs
approximately 250 people. Since July 2015, we have made significant investments in the
automation of the processes in our Logisteo warehouse in order to improve the accuracy and
speed with which products are delivered to customers and increase our product offering. As of
August 31, 2015, we had already invested €2.4 million in this project and expect that completion
of the project during the course of the next 18 months will generate cost savings for us in the
long term. In 2013, we also invested in the expansion of our call center for our collision repair
service in order to improve the quality of our service for our collision business customers.

Our large geographic footprint, vertically integrated distribution system and advanced logistics
platforms allow us to provide efficient and effective service to our customers throughout France.
We provide several daily deliveries, including deliveries within two hours for fast-moving items

90


-----

and next business day deliveries for slow-moving items. If a distributor does not have a specific
spare part in stock, we are able to deliver the item to that distributor from one of our logistics
platforms or arrange delivery directly from the supplier within one business day of order
placement. We also deliver other services for our customers, including user-friendly websites and
online and offline support, technical hotlines and training services. Our online business-tobusiness car and truck repair and maintenance web portals (Autossimo and Truckissimo,
respectively) provide user-friendly portals for garages to search for and directly order from a
large selection of spare parts and to obtain technical information, thereby improving the
customer experience and reducing our call center costs. We believe that these web portals
provide us with a competitive advantage, and approximately €122 million, or 18.2%, of our
revenue from sales of light vehicle spare parts by both our wholly-owned distributors and
affiliated independent distributors for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015 were placed
through our online portal, Autossimo. We believe that the consistently high quality of services
we offer drives customer loyalty and reinforces our market-leading positions.

Our customized IT system plays a key role in allowing us to manage inventory levels and delivery
schedules effectively. In late 2013 and early 2014, we upgraded the warehouse IT management
system of our light vehicle logistics platform, which we believe is best-in-class. We are also in the
process of upgrading our IT systems for our sales department, and have rolled out eBook, a
tablet-based program that allows our sales representatives to see previous customer orders and
to make suggestions for purchases based on the customer’s profile. We believe that our IT
systems provide us with a significant advantage and drive our ability to serve our customers on a
timely and efficient basis.

As the IAM grows more complex as a result of the evolution of technical parts and an increased
assortment of spare parts, equipment and tools available on the market, the ability to operate
efficiently will be increasingly important in maintaining our high-quality service and our marketleading positions. As a result, we have made, and expect to continue to make in the future,
judicious investments in IT.

**_Improved financial performance and strong cash flow generation with a capex-light business_**
**_model_**

During the last three fiscal years, we generated stable revenue, increased our Adjusted EBITDA
margin from 4.4% to 5.9%, and maintained stable cash flow generation despite the recent
economic downturn, with a cash conversion (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure,
divided by Adjusted EBITDA) of 68.1% for the year ended December 31, 2012, 68.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2013, 73.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 72.5% for the
twelve-month period ended August 31, 2015. For the eight months ended August 31, 2015, we
achieved an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.1%. We have driven Adjusted EBITDA margin
improvement during the last five years by implementing a series of profit enhancement
measures: since these measures were implemented, our EBITDA has increased more than
€65 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the twelve months ended August 31,
2015. These measures include, among others: the maximization of suppliers’ rebates via increased
purchasing by our central purchasing departments and integrated Group-wide purchasing
(including our affiliated independent distributors), cost reductions in the aggregate
compensation of local management and administration through the implementation of shared
services, and reductions in transportation and logistics costs by optimizing the delivery routes
between our distribution sites and our customers and increasing the use of central distribution
facilities. In addition, we improved our cash flows from operating activities (including changes in
working capital and other items with cash effect) from €15.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010 to €50.8 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015.

We operate a capex-light business model using rented facilities, and thus our operations do not
require us to own or maintain extensive physical infrastructure. During the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, our capital expenditures amounted to 2.0% of our revenue and consisted of
maintenance expenditures for our distribution facilities, and upgrades to our sales and
warehouse IT management systems, as well as our first investment in Logisteo’s automation
process development. Our low levels of maintenance capital expenditure requirements (as a
percentage of revenue) have allowed us to invest in our business, maintain our leading market
positions, improve operating efficiency and achieve deleveraging through Adjusted EBITDA
growth and cash generation.

management team.

### Our strategy

The key elements of our business strategy are:

**_Continue to strengthen our market-leading positions_**

_Light vehicle and truck parts_

We intend to strengthen our position as a market leader in the French light vehicle IAM through
organic growth. With more than 50 years of experience, we believe that we are well positioned
to maximize growth opportunities in the increasingly complex light vehicle IAM. To accomplish
this growth, we plan to extend our network coverage, improve our sales force performance and
practices, develop new key accounts, expand our commercial relationships with fast-fitters and
enhance the efficiency of our supply chain for express orders. As part of this strategy, we
acquired ACR on April 7, 2014. ACR is a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light
vehicles with an established footprint in the internet sales channels. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2015, ACR generated gross revenue (before customer rebates) and
stand-alone EBITDA of €82.9 million and €7.2 million, respectively. Internet dealers, key accounts
and others (including distributors) accounted for approximately 40%, 18.5% and 41.4% of gross
revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, ACR generated gross revenue
(before customer rebates) and stand-alone EBITDA of €75.1 million and €6.1 million, respectively.
Internet dealers, key accounts and others (including distributors) accounted for approximately
36.5%, 19.6% and 43.9%, respectively. We may also seek to expand our geographic coverage by
making selective acquisitions which are accretive to our network.

_Collision parts_

Revenue from our collision repair services increased at a compound average growth rate (CAGR)
of 11.4% between 2010 and 2014. We intend to leverage our logistics platforms, competitive
prices and high levels of service to continue to win new contracts with insurance companies for
our collision repair services. We plan to channel this business to our branded garages in order to
strengthen our partnerships with such garages and insurers and increase demand for the
provision of collision repair parts from our distributors.

**_Enhance customer service_**

We intend to continue to enhance the high-quality service that we provide to customers by
ensuring seamless execution from order to delivery and by further increasing our already
extensive product assortment. We believe that our range of spare parts on offer, efficient and
effective order execution, and timely product delivery will continue to drive customer loyalty. We
plan to shorten the time between order placement by our customers and delivery of products by
improving our logistics and distribution system, including through the recent upgrade of the
warehouse IT management system of our light vehicle logistics platform. The ACR Acquisition has

92


-----

allowed us to benefit from ACR’s experience in product return management and its specialization
in deliveries within two to four hours of order.

We seek to offer an even more extensive product range in the light vehicle, collision and truck
sectors. We believe that this will provide us with growth potential by allowing us to capture
market share for new brands and product lines. For example, we plan to further expand our
portfolio by including additional product families for chassis, engines, electronics and light
vehicle body parts. We also plan to further develop our private label ISOTECH product line for
the light vehicle and truck aftermarket and the private label product line of ACR for the light
vehicle aftermarket. We also plan to introduce at least one new product line every year. We
believe that this approach will allow us to address different types of customers with different
value propositions, ultimately optimizing our market coverage. We also believe that an increase
in private label product lines as a percentage of our total revenues will improve our
competitiveness and margins.

**_Continue to optimize organizational efficiency_**

We intend to continue to optimize our operational processes by implementing several changes to
the organization of our supply chain, inventory management, IT, real estate, human resources
and logistics, which we believe will allow us to increase the quality of our operations and reduce
fixed costs in our real estate and employee cost base. We plan to further standardize our central
administration and enhance our IT support in order to implement these changes. In addition, we
intend to continue to invest in our logistics platforms in order to reduce costs, facilitate
operational efficiencies, strengthen our supply chain and provide our customers with better
product coverage and availability. By further enhancing existing software and installing new
software, such as the recent upgrade of the warehouse IT management system of our light
vehicle logistics platform, we will be able to expedite our logistics and optimize the processing of
orders. We also intend to further strengthen our Polish operations and to improve our EBITDA
margins in Poland pursuant to a profit improvement plan which is currently being implemented.

**_Continue to improve purchasing performance_**

We believe that one of the most important factors in our success has been our ability to use the
purchasing power derived from our size, integrated business model, specialized warehouse
management and logistics systems, and partnership with AD International to obtain larger
rebates and more favorable terms from suppliers than are available to other participants in the
IAM. We intend to continue to seek to capitalize on our scale and integrated purchasing to
negotiate better prices and purchase conditions with our suppliers. For example, the scale
increase resulting from the ACR Acquisition has allowed us to further improve our purchasing
performance as we shared a significant number of suppliers with ACR, which now benefits from
the more advantageous terms of our existing agreements with these suppliers. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, we estimate that the purchasing savings resulting from the ACR
Acquisition on a run-rate basis will amount to €6.5 million, of which €5.9 million had already
been achieved as of August 31, 2015. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the share of
purchases made by our affiliated independent distributors through our central purchasing
departments, which we expect will further increase our sales volumes and improve our
purchasing power.

**_Increase focus on over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts_**

Our over-the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 10% of
our revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015. The French “do-it-yourself”
aftermarket represents a high-margin market, and we are developing strategies, including loyalty
cards and sales force training, which target these customers and allow us to effectively compete
against online light vehicle spare parts retailers. The integration of ACR, which serves online light
vehicle spare parts retailers, increases our presence in this segment of the IAM. Whether an order
is placed at one of our distribution sites or online, we believe that our timely over-the-counter
product delivery provides us with a strategic advantage compared to online-only light vehicle
spare parts retailers, which have inherent lead times for acquiring spare parts. We regularly
assess our over-the-counter sales vis-à-vis our existing business-to-business sales objectives in

93


-----

terms of pricing and demand elasticity, as well as the impact of our over-the-counter sales on our
business-to-business sales.

### History

We were founded in 1962 to formalize the cooperation between a number of existing
independent light vehicle aftermarket distributors and quickly became a key link throughout
France between original equipment suppliers and spare parts suppliers on the one hand, and
local spare parts distributors, garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers on the other hand.
In 1983, we expanded our footprint throughout France, both at the distributor level and the
garage level, by forming our network of wholly-owned distributors and rolling out our concept
of a network of branded garages that comprised key customers and were independent from
Autodistribution. We launched our truck business in 1988 to supply spare parts for trucks, tractors
and trailers. It was the first independent distributor network of spare parts for trucks in France.

In 2007, we entered the Polish market by purchasing three local distributors who currently form
the core distributors of AD Polska. In 2009, we entered the Italian market and formed AD Italy.
We sold our majority stake in AD Italy in 2012.

Throughout our history, we have expanded our business through organic growth and strategic
acquisitions. We enhanced our logistics platform through the acquisitions of Cora, a leading
independent French distributor of light vehicle parts for collision repair, in 2005 and Bremstar, a
distributor with a logistics platform dedicated to truck parts for maintenance and repair, in 2008.
We also acquired Enssemble, a network of light vehicle spare parts distributors, in 2012, and
FPLS, a truck spare parts distributor, in 2013. In December 2013, we acquired Rougon Queyrel, a
distributor of spare parts for light vehicles in southeastern France. In April 2014, we acquired
ACR, a specialized distributor in France of spare parts for light vehicles.

Having realized at an early stage that the internet offered innovative opportunities for light
vehicle and truck spare parts distributors, we created the Autossimo online business-to-business
light vehicle repair and maintenance web portal in 2000 and the Truckissimo online business-tobusiness truck repair and maintenance web portal in 2001. We have also developed our own
private label, ISOTECH, which features spare parts for both light vehicles and trucks, such as
batteries and lubricants, and was relaunched in 2008.

_Safeguard (procédure de sauvegarde)_

Between February 18, 2009 and April 6, 2009, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Target
were subject to safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) opened by the Commercial
Court of Evry. Safeguard proceedings in France are a commercial court-led process opened on a
voluntary basis by a company in which such company seeks court protection from creditors in
order to achieve a restructuring plan.

In 2009, before the opening of our safeguard proceedings in February, we signed a restructuring
agreement with our creditors approving our debt restructuring and our equity-financed majority
acquisition by TowerBrook. The safeguard proceedings allowed the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Target to confirm and implement the restructuring plan contemplated in the
restructuring agreement, thereby reducing the impact of the restructuring on our primary
operating company Autodistribution S.A., its central purchasing departments, its subsidiaries and
its network, which were not materially affected by this procedure and continued to operate in
the ordinary course of business.

On April 6, 2009, the Commercial Court of Evry adopted safeguard plans for the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Target, thereby ending the safeguard proceedings in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Target. During the implementation of the safeguard plans, the
relationships of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Target with their creditors were
governed by the provisions of their respective safeguard plans. Those creditors were repaid in full
using a portion of the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes, and, as a result, the Commercial
Court of Evry acknowledged the completion of the safeguard plans by two judgments, each
dated as of October 2, 2014, pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Target
are no longer subject to the safeguard proceedings.

### Our geographic markets

We primarily distribute our products in France and have a total of 38 wholly-owned and 42
affiliated independent distributors, as well as approximately 3,200 branded garages, which
participate in an affiliate program through which they receive enhanced service and support
from us, and in return our wholly-owned and affiliated independent distributors are designated
as their preferred distributor. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, 90.6% of our
revenue was generated by our operations in France. We have an extensive distribution network
in France for our light vehicle spare parts business line, with distributors in every region of the
country. Our central management and headquarters and most of our central purchasing
functions are located in Arcueil, near Paris. Two of our logistics platforms, Logisteo (which
distributes light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair) and Bremstar (which distributes truck
parts for maintenance and repair), are located in Moissy Cramayel and Pringy, in the Seine-etMarne department. Our Cora logistics platform (which distributes light vehicle parts for collision
repair) is located in Chaponnay and Corbas, in the Rhone department. Our ACR logistics platform
is located in Gennevilliers, in the Hauts-de-Seine department.

We also operate in Poland, where we are a leading light vehicle spare parts distributor, with a
distribution network of three warehouses and 44 wholly-owned distributors. For the twelve
months ended August 31, 2015, 9.4% of our revenue was generated by our operations in Poland.

### Our product lines

We provide light vehicle and truck spare parts in each of the following segments of the
aftermarket: (i) light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair; (ii) light vehicle parts for collision
repair; (iii) truck parts for maintenance and repair; and (iv) equipment and tools for garages in
both the IAM and OES.

Our product portfolio includes a broad range of parts that are used in light vehicles and trucks,

-----

maintenance and repair of light vehicles. 31 of our 38 wholly-owned distributors and 34 of our 42
affiliated independent distributors sell a full range of light vehicle parts for maintenance and
repair, including engine parts, brakes and batteries, in all regions of France through 357
distribution sites.

We also distribute spare parts for the maintenance and repair of light vehicles to independent
garages, including 2,441 branded garages (as of August 31, 2015). This network includes 1,937
“AD” branded garages, of which 1,013 are designated “Garage AD Expert,” identifying them as
providing end-customers with both routine maintenance and more complex repair services; seven
AD Autoservices, which are multi-service garages offering maintenance, repair and bodywork
services; 1,193 Auto Primo garages; and 67 Staff Auto garages. We developed our network of
branded garages based on population density in particular areas. For example, in rural areas we
aim to have one branded garage for every 15,000 inhabitants living within a 15-kilometer radius
of that garage. Our branded garages perform repair services for all major light vehicle brands
and models and use our integrated diagnostic tools.

In addition, we have entered into service agreements for light vehicle parts for maintenance and
repair with companies with large light vehicle fleets, as well as partnerships with fast-fitters and
car centers.

_Private label_

In 2008, we relaunched our private label ISOTECH product line, which currently comprises eight
product groups sold under our AD brand for the light vehicle aftermarket, including batteries,
lubricants, timing kits, water pumps and braking components. We primarily sell our ISOTECH
products directly to customers, either over the counter or through online sales. Our ISOTECH
products are currently offered at a discount rate of approximately 15% compared to prevailing
market prices, but generate a higher margin for us than third-party branded products.

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Autossimo, which is an online business-to-business
light vehicle repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops with an online catalog
of more than 1.7 million spare parts, representing over 430 different original equipment
suppliers, and which has over 8,000 customers. The website offers continuously updated technical
databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use portal outlining repair methods,
connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price comparison tools by
brands, inventory access and an online ordering platform.

**_Light vehicle parts for collision repair_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, approximately 15.3% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the sale of light vehicle parts for collision
repair. The collision repair products that we distribute include a wide range of integrated
products and include individual parts and entire body components. We manage our collision
repair services through three-way partnerships among independent garages, insurers and us. Our
agreements with insurers are one-year agreements renewable on an annual basis.

We also distribute light vehicle parts for collision repair to independent body shops including,
629 branded body shops (as of December 31, 2014) operating under the “Carosserie AD” brand.
We use our specialized logistics platform Cora for the delivery of light vehicle parts for collision
repair to wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors.

_Website_

We have our own call center which directly serves the customers of insurance companies. We are
also in the process of developing the website “Carrossimo,” which is an online business-tobusiness collision repair portal for body shops with a finalization scheduled for September 2016.

**_Truck parts for maintenance and repair_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, approximately 14.1% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the distribution of truck spare parts, for
which we are the leading independent distributor in France (based on our geographic network).

96


-----

Our subsidiary Bremstar offers over 15,000 truck spare parts from 60 suppliers which we generally
stock in our warehouses for shipment on an expedited basis. As of August 31, 2015, 86 whollyowned distributors and 49 affiliated independent distributors were selling truck parts for
maintenance and repair.

We also distribute truck parts for maintenance and repair to 172 branded truck garages in France
(as of August 31, 2015) operating under our AD brands, of which 75 were wholly-owned and 51
were independent affiliates. We use our specialized logistics platform Bremstar for the delivery
of truck parts for maintenance and repair to our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated
independent distributors. We increased our footprint in the truck aftermarket by acquiring FPLS,
a truck parts distributor, in 2013. We also entered into a partnership in 2012 with TIP Trailer
Services, a trailer rental service business in Europe which has a fleet of approximately 48,000
trucks, pursuant to which we provide truck parts for the maintenance and repair of the fleet of
TIP Trailer Services.

_Private label_

Our ISOTECH product line for truck parts for maintenance and repair currently comprises five
groups of products which are sold under our AD brand for the truck aftermarket, such as
batteries, lubricant, water pumps or headlights.

_Website_

We have developed the internet platform Truckissimo, which is an online business-to-business
truck repair and maintenance portal for repairers and body shops. The website offers
continuously updated technical databases and management tools, such as an easy-to-use portal
outlining repair methods, connected diagnostic and costing tools, parts identification tools, price
comparison tools by brand and inventory access.

**_Equipment, tools and other_**

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, approximately 16.8% of our revenue in France
was generated by our wholly-owned distributors from the distribution and maintenance of
equipment and tools for light vehicle maintenance and repair. We have a comprehensive
equipment and tool product offering, which includes garage equipment, such as light vehicles
lifts and diagnostic tools, personal safety equipment and tools, as well as a wide range of
technical parts such as lambda sensors, flow meters and turbochargers. We also provide
installation and other after-sales services for these products. Furthermore, we have developed
Diag’issimo, an interface which connects leading diagnostic tools with the Autossimo online light
vehicle repair and maintenance portal, providing over 8,000 customers with an integrated
solution from diagnostics to spare parts order placement.

### Our distribution platforms and end-customers

_France_

In France, we purchase light vehicle parts and sell them (i) through our wholly-owned distributors
to independent garages, body shops, fast-fitters and car centers and (ii) to affiliated independent
distributors. We have a similar distribution model for collision repair, for which our subsidiary
Cora acts as central purchasing department and warehouse, and for spare parts for trucks, for
which our subsidiary Bremstar acts as central purchasing department and warehouse. For the
twelve months ended August 31, 2015, our wholly-owned distributors generated 71% of our
revenue through sales of spare parts to garages and over-the-counter sales, and our sales to
affiliated independent distributors generated 25% of our revenue. For the twelve months ended
August 31, 2015, approximately 4% of the revenue generated by our independent affiliated
distributors was derived from sales by our logistics platforms Cora and Bremstar.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, our wholly-owned distributors generated a net
revenue of €846.5 million, or 77% of our total net revenue, through sales of spare parts to
garages and over-the-counter sales.

For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, our logistics platforms generated 45% of our
revenue. After deduction of intercompany sales to wholly-owned distributors, the net revenue
from sales to affiliated independent distributors for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015

97


-----

was €272.9 million, or 22.5% of our total revenue. Our Cora and Bremstar logistics platforms
generated a net revenue of €49.2 million, or 4.1% of our total net revenue.

As of August 31, 2015, we had a broad network of 38 wholly-owned distributors and 42 affiliated
independent distributors in France. These distributors operated out of 492 distribution sites
which are supplied either by our four main warehouses (one for light vehicle parts, one for
collision repair parts, one for truck parts and one for ACR) or through direct shipments from the
supplier to the distributor. 49 of our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors distribute light vehicle spare parts from 357 distribution sites (including 120 affiliated
independent distributors and 237 wholly-owned distributors), and 48 of our wholly-owned and
affiliated independent distributors distribute truck spare parts from 135 distribution sites
(including 49 affiliated independent distributors and 86 wholly-owned distributors).

We obtain rebates from our suppliers because we purchase products on a large scale, thereby
allowing our central purchasing departments to negotiate favorable contracts with our suppliers.
We pass on a portion of these rebates to affiliated independent distributors, and our
wholly-owned distributors pass on a portion of these rebates when they sell spare parts to
garages.

Both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors on-sell to a variety of
end-customers, including independent light vehicle garages, over-the-counter sales, truck fleets,
car dealers, and auto centers and fast-fitters.

The following graph shows the percentage of revenue generated by our wholly-owned distributors
in France by end-customer type for twelve months ended August 31, 2015.

**Wholly-owned distributor sales by end-customer**

Auto centers/
Fast-fitters
**4%** Others 5%

Car dealers
**11%**


Truck fleets
**18%**


Independent
light vehicle
garages
**43%**


Over-thecounter sales
**19%**

Our principal end-customers are garages. Garages require up to eight deliveries per day and, in
the case of certain fast-moving parts (parts for which there is a high demand), may require
delivery within two hours of order. We provide next business day deliveries for slow-moving
items (parts for which there is a lower demand). Garages also need technical support to assist
them with diagnostics, the identification of parts and repair methods, and the ordering of tools.
In addition, garages require frequent training, as spare parts and related repairs become more
technologically complex. We provide all these services, replicating for garages what light vehicle
manufacturers provide for their own affiliated network of garages, but with the added
complexity of providing these services for all light vehicle models.

We also provide truck spare parts to truck fleet companies, which are equipment services
providers that specialize in the leasing and rental of trailers, tankers and other equipment, as
well as maintenance, damage repair, fleet management and telematics, requiring the truck fleet
company to have truck spare parts readily available or delivered in a short period of time.

In addition, we distribute spare parts through our wholly-owned distributors to over-the-counter
customers, including, among others, semi-professional and “do-it-yourself” customers. Our over
98


-----

the-counter sales of light vehicle spare parts in France generated approximately 10% of our
revenue for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015.

_Poland_

Our Polish distribution system is similar to our French distribution system, except that in Poland
we distribute parts only to wholly-owned distributors. Our three warehouses in Poland store over
84,000 spare parts and distribute these parts to our wholly-owned distributors, which sell them to
garages and shops, most of which are located in the south of Poland. For the twelve months
ended August 31, 2015, 37% of our revenue in Poland was generated by sales to retail shops,
32% was generated by sales to garages, and 32% was generated by sales to car centers and
others. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, sales at our Polish distributors consisted
primarily of spare parts, called “extended spare parts” (71.93% of our sales in Poland with
65.79% for pure spare parts, 2.13% of tools and equipment, 2.64% of body parts and 1.37% of
painting), lubricants (14.06% of our sales in Poland), tires (7.68% of our sales in Poland) and
batteries (6.33% of our sales in Poland). Our distributors are able to make up to eight deliveries
per day to our customers, which helps to ensure the loyalty of our customers. We have also
developed a network of more than 460 branded garages, including 148 AD garages, 21 AD
Serwis garages, 21 AD Karoseria garages and 293 Auto Primo garages in order to increase our
brand recognition in Poland. Our Polish distributors primarily use their automated platform to
generate and track orders, with sales through this platform accounting for more than 60% of our
revenue in Poland for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015. We also have three call centers
and over 90 sales staff in Poland.

### Supply and procurement

Our distribution system is organized around our four main central purchasing departments,
which buy aftermarket spare parts and equipment and tools from our suppliers, which are then
sold to our wholly-owned distributors or to affiliated independent distributors. Our four main
central purchasing departments are: Logisteo for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair;
Cora for light vehicle parts for collision repair; Bremstar for truck parts for maintenance and
repair; and ACR for light vehicle parts. These central purchasing departments implement our
procurement policy and negotiate prices for the approximately one million commonly-used spare
parts that we purchase directly from over 300 suppliers. We buy substantially all of the products
that we distribute directly from spare parts manufacturers, which we believe allows us to use our
scale and centralized purchasing function to obtain favorable prices, rebates and other terms.

We select our suppliers via tender procedures for each product category that we distribute. For
example, we select our brake or battery suppliers every three years. When selecting our suppliers,
we take into account the quality and price of the spare parts or products, as well as a supplier’s
ability to deliver items within the deadlines required. We enter into annually-renewable
contracts with our suppliers, which include standard terms and conditions, such as logistics
rebates or inflation adjustments for pricing. We negotiate supplier rebates on an annual basis.
These supplier rebates comprise monthly bonuses on commercial and logistics services, as well as
year-end rebates based on annual thresholds achieved. While negotiating these contracts, our
scale and our central purchasing function allow obtaining optimal terms. We also invoice on a
monthly basis additional services linked to direct deliveries from our suppliers to our whollyowned and affiliated independent distributors, as well as deliveries by suppliers to our
warehouses, or related logistics services.

We use our central purchasing system to monitor customer purchases across our network and
quickly change our product portfolio in order to meet customer demand. We seek to buy in large
quantities so that the savings made by buying in bulk offset the costs associated with
maintaining large inventories at our warehouses.

We also benefit from our AD International membership, a cross-border partnership among
distributors of aftermarket spare parts that allows members to benefit from reduced purchase
pricing through negotiations with suppliers on the basis of consolidated volumes, common
marketing concepts and best-practice sharing. For the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, AD
International had members in 32 countries.

99


-----

During the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, our top 25 suppliers in France accounted for
59% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar). Our largest supplier in France, Robert
Bosch, accounted for 10.6% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar) and our secondlargest supplier, Shaeffler, accounted for 4.8% of our purchases (excluding Cora and Bremstar).
Except for Robert Bosch, no supplier in France accounts for more than 5% of our total purchases
(excluding Cora and Bremstar) as of August 31, 2015.

### Logistics

We operate four main central logistics platforms (for light vehicle parts for maintenance and
repair, for light vehicle parts for collision repair and for truck parts for maintenance and repair)
to allow both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent distributors to respond
to customer expectations in terms of product availability and timely delivery. Our four main
central logistics platforms are:

  - Logisteo: Logisteo is our central warehouse from which spare parts for light vehicle
repair and maintenance are distributed. As of December 31, 2014, it was the largest
independent logistics platform for light vehicle parts for maintenance and repair in France
and had over 20,000 square meters of storage space and stored over 57,000 spare parts
references of 140 brands. It supplies approximately 500 distribution sites and employs more
than 230 people. Deliveries of regular orders are made within four business days and
express orders within the next business day.

  - Bremstar: Bremstar was established in 1995, and we acquired it in 2008. It distributes
truck parts for maintenance and repair. It has over 10,000 square meters of storage space
and stores over 15,000 spare parts references. It supplies all of the 135 truck distribution
sites and employed over 40 people (as of December 31, 2014). Deliveries of express orders
are made by the next business day and regular orders are made within five business days.

  - Cora: Cora was established in 1967, and we acquired it in 2005. It distributes light vehicle
parts for collision repairs and has over 35,000 square meters of storage space. It stores over
70,000 spare parts references from 35 brands and employed over 100 people (as of
August 31, 2015).

  - ACR: ACR was established in 2010, and we acquired it in 2014. It distributes light vehicle
parts and has approximately 7,800 square meters of storage space, across our main
warehouse and eight smaller sites in France. It stores over 70,000 spare parts references. It
has nine distribution sites in France and employed over 165 people (as of August 31, 2015).
Deliveries of regular orders are made within four hours in 85% of the French territory
covered by ACR.

Of the total value of all products that we purchased from our referenced suppliers in France during
the twelve months ended August 31, 2015, products representing 45% in value were delivered
through our four main warehouses to our wholly-owned and affiliated distributors and products
representing 55% in value were delivered directly to our distributors by spare parts manufacturers.
We plan to increase the amount of orders delivered through our logistics platforms, which allows for
bulk purchases on favorable conditions.

The logistics department of each of our Logisteo, Cora and Bremstar logistics platforms has the
following primary responsibilities:

  - Inbound _logistics:_ Accepting incoming products from suppliers and monitoring
compliance with the supply specifications negotiated by our supply chain department.

  - Stocking: Determining the shelf space to be allocated to each product, and the shelf
placement in accordance with turnover indices and product size. The proper placement of
products within the dedicated space is crucial to optimize the available space in each of
our distribution centers.

  - Picking, packing and outbound logistics: The space management practices carried out by
our logistics department allows us to maximize efficiency in locating and retrieving
products from the shelves and assembling orders of outgoing products. If products have

-----

not been previously packaged by the suppliers, the logistics department is able to carry out
this activity.

  - Shipping: Organizing and monitoring transportation.

The transport of products from our logistics platforms to our distribution network is carried out
through independent carriers. Our logistics department is responsible for setting performance
targets and related incentives and penalties for third-party carriers, while continuously
monitoring the performance of carriers in order to improve customer service. We plan and
monitor product flows through our IT systems. We lease, rather than own, our distribution
centers, thereby limiting our permanent investment in fixed assets.

### Our contracts

In the ordinary course of our business, we enter into various contractual arrangements with our
suppliers, affiliated independent distributors, wholly-owned distributors and branded garages.

  - Suppliers: Our contracts with our suppliers are typically entered into for a one-year term,
without automatic renewal, and may include supply specifications regarding the lead time,
the frequency of deliveries and packaging, and the achievement by suppliers of certain
performance targets. These targets are continuously monitored to ensure that our
inventory is managed effectively and to improve customer service. Bonuses or penalties
may apply on a case-by-case basis, depending on whether targets are reached or not.
Inventory levels in the distribution centers are monitored by applying calculation
procedures which may take into account, among other things, current inventory levels and
past analysis of customer demand.

  - Affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors: Our contractual
arrangements with our affiliated independent distributors include agreements and
commercial contracts. Pursuant to our affiliation agreements, our affiliated independent
distributors agree to operate under the AD brand and to receive our support services in
exchange for a membership fee. Our central purchasing departments enter into
commercial contracts with both our wholly-owned distributors and affiliated independent
distributors, which include the same purchase conditions and volume discounts for both
affiliated independent distributors and wholly-owned distributors, and our affiliated
independent distributors receive a loyalty bonus if the purchases made through our central
purchasing departments account for typically at least 70% of their overall purchase
volumes.

  - Branded garages: We enter into agreements with independent garages, pursuant to
which they become branded garages in exchange for a membership fee.

### Sales

Our sales department is responsible for managing relationships with existing customers and
establishing relationships with new customers, setting sales targets and implementing sales
policies, which includes customer payment terms in cooperation with the finance and control
department and managing payment collection in cooperation with the administration
department.

Our sales department is divided between our two principal business lines: light vehicles and
trucks.

  - Light vehicles: This division supports our light vehicle spare parts distribution business. It
operates at the central, regional and local levels in order to address the fragmented
market of light vehicle parts distributors, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

  - Trucks: This division supports our truck spare parts distribution business. It operates at
the central, regional and local levels, and is supported by regional and local logistics
platforms at these levels.

### Marketing and advertising

Our marketing department is located in our headquarters in Arcueil (near Paris) and is focused on
improving awareness and perception of our brand. Our marketing and advertising expenses were
€3.6 million for the twelve months ended August 31, 2015. We market our distribution services to
both affiliated independent distributors and garages, and engage in joint marketing campaigns
with our suppliers that target garage end-customers.

We continuously invest in our marketing efforts in order to sustain our sales and upgrade our
existing products. Our websites are one of our main marketing tools. They receive an average of
200,000 individual visits per month. We also regularly organize promotional campaigns for
certain of the light vehicle and truck spare parts that we distribute.

### Information technology

Our IT department is located in Chilly-Mazarin (near Paris) and plays an important role in our
distribution process and operations, since we rely on it to manage our sales, supply chain and
internal control. Our IT department supports our sales department, purchasing department,
logistics department and accounting department.

Our IT department, in coordination with our sales department, has developed software to
integrate our logistics platforms with an electronic interface which allows our customers to place
orders online and obtain information regarding the availability of the products that we
distribute, sales terms, conditions and shipping times. In 2012, our IT department also developed
an eBook for our sales department, a tablet-based program allowing our sales representatives to
see previous customer orders and make suggestions for purchases based on the customer profile.

Our IT department collaborates with our logistics department, primarily to update the software
and algorithms used to determine adequate inventory levels at our warehouses, product flows
and the optimal shelf positioning of the products that we distribute. For instance, we have
recently upgraded, and continue to invest in, the warehouse IT management system of our light
vehicle logistics platform, Logisteo, in order to manage our inventory more efficiently. Our IT
system also enables us to determine product availability in real time and update the inventories
of our warehouses accordingly.

### Intellectual property

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trademarks in our business. Except for the
trademarks Autodistribution, Garage Expert AD, Auto Primo, Autossimo, AD PL, the “AD” logo,
the garage names associated with the “AD” logo and ISOTECH, which are recognized brands in
the industry, we do not believe that any of our other trade names, service marks or trademarks
are material to our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws
to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We are not currently engaged in any
material intellectual property litigation, nor do we know of any material intellectual property
claims outstanding.

### Employees

As of August 31, 2015, we employed 6,133 people, of whom 5,325 were employed in France.

The following table sets forth the number of employees as of December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014
and as of August 31, 2015.

-----

In the last three years, we have not experienced any material disruption to our business as a
result of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes that were specific to us. We believe that
our relations with our employees are good.

We attach great importance to providing high-quality and expert service to our customers.
Maintaining and repairing complex light vehicles and trucks requires well-trained and skillful
employees. Selling light vehicle and truck spare parts and equipment and tools also requires
expertise regarding the products and their use. We therefore provide our employees with a
broad range of training.

To ensure the continued professional development of our employees, we have established a
comprehensive training program. We have also created the Institut AD, which offers a number of
technical training modules through specialized training organizations and equipment
manufactures.

### Competition

We face numerous sources of competition in the highly fragmented French and Polish spare parts
aftermarket in which we operate. See “Industry.”

Our main competitor in France is Alliance Automotive Group, which operates under four main
distribution networks in France: Groupauto, with 255 distribution sites; Precisium, with
292 distribution sites; Partner’s, with 231 distribution sites; and GEFA, with 150 distribution sites.
Alliance Automotive Group also operates ten different affiliation brands for light vehicle garages
and one affiliation brand of truck garages. Although the overall number of competitors has
decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the IAM remains very competitive. Customers
select spare parts suppliers based on a number of factors, including product range and product
availability, service level, price and value-added services.

Our main competitors in Poland include Inter Cars, Fota and Group Auto Union Polska.

E-business provides limited competition in France and Poland, targeting mainly over-the-counter
retail markets, representing a relatively small portion of the overall market. The strong
development of the e-business during these last years has considerably impacted our “cash client
“sales. Our actions, such as our price positioning on the “Isotech” brand, allow us to stabilize this
type of sales. The ACR Acquisition also allowed us to address the business through internet
purchases without directly competing with players in e-business.

### Properties

As of August 31, 2015, we operated a network of 38 wholly-owned distributors. As of August 31,
2015, we leased substantially all of our warehouses and distribution sites.

### Environment, health and safety

Although we do not manufacture the products we distribute, the storage of spare parts subjects
our facilities and operations to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws govern, among other
things, discharges of pollutants, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and waste,
and the clean-up of contaminated properties. Violations of environmental laws, applicable
authorizations or permits can result in significant fines or civil or criminal sanctions. In addition,
the discovery of contamination at our facilities could require us to incur substantial clean-up
costs.

Environmental authorizations or permits required for some of our operations may be reviewed,
modified or revoked by the issuing authorities. We believe that we are in material compliance
with the environmental laws applicable to our business. Our environmental and occupational
health and safety costs have not significantly affected our results of operations or financial
position during the previous twelve months.

103


-----

### Insurance

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary operation of our business,
including general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fleet, damages and losses and IT risk
insurance. All of our policies are underwritten with reputable insurance providers, and we
conduct yearly reviews of our insurance coverage with our broker and our insurance providers.
We believe that our insurance policies provide sufficient coverage of the risks facing our business.

### Legal proceedings

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of our business, such as employee claims, disputes with our suppliers, disputes with our
lessors at the renewal of our commercial leases and intellectual property disputes. We are not
currently involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are
expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We
note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be difficult to predict and we offer no
assurance in this regard.

_Klarius S.A.S. vs. Autodistributions S.A._

On September 10, 2008, Klarius S.A.S., a manufacturer of light vehicle spare parts for
maintenance and repair in France, commenced proceedings against us and our subsidiaries
before the Chartres Commercial Court (Tribunal de Commerce), claiming that we unfairly
terminated our established commercial relationship with them. We argued that Klarius S.A.S.’s
claim was not valid, since Klarius S.A.S. would have never started legal proceedings against us,
but for its financial distress, because Klarius S.A.S. was declared bankrupt on March 26, 2008 and
winding-up proceedings commenced in September 19, 2008. The Chartres Commercial Court,
however, rejected our argument on June 5, 2012 and found that Klarius S.A.S. had a valid claim.
This proceeding is still pending. Klarius S.A.S. is claiming €2.4 million in damages. We dispute the
merits of this claim and no provision in respect thereof has been created in our financial accounts
as of August 31, 2015.

# Regulation

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Some of the most pertinent to the_
_business sector in which we operate are laws and regulations that pertain to the light vehicle and_
_truck wholesale sector and light vehicle inspections. The paragraphs below briefly describe some_
_of that laws and regulations (focusing on French and EU laws and regulations). This section does_
_not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the laws and regulations to which we are_
_subject and that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes._

### European Union

The sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts’ wholesale and repair and maintenance services
are currently regulated in the European Union by Regulation (EU) No. 461/2010 (the “New BER”),
which replaced Regulation (EC) No. 1400/2002 (the “BER 2002”) in 2010. Unlike BER 2002, the
New BER does not apply to the purchase, sale or resale of new motor vehicles, which are covered
by Regulation 330/2010/EC. Accordingly, the material scope of the New BER is now limited to the
distribution of spare parts and the provision of repair and maintenance services for motor
vehicles.

The New BER also applies to (i) the general EU competition law and (ii) the General Vertical Block
Exemption Regulation (Commission Regulation (EU) n°330/2010 of April 20, 2010 on the
Application of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of vertical
agreements and concerted practices (the “General BER”)) and the corresponding EU Guidelines
on Vertical Restraints.

These provisions aim to ensure fair competition in these markets in order to safeguard that
original and equivalent spare parts competing with those branded by the light vehicle (referred
to as “passenger cars” under the New BER) and trucks (referred to as “commercial vehicles”
under the New BER) manufacturers have full access to the market.

Pursuant to these rules, agreements relating to the sale or distribution of light vehicle and truck
spare parts and repair and maintenance services are exempted from the application of
Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), which
prohibits anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, if they comply with the provisions
of both:

  - the General BER, which only applies if:

    - both parties have less than 30% of the market share in their respective markets; and

    - the agreement does not contain any of the hardcore restrictions provided in the General
BER; and

  - the New BER, which implies that:

   - no restriction may be imposed on the business of independent garages by way of a
selective distribution system under which a supplier is obligated to sell its goods or
services under a contract only to selected distributors on the basis of specific criteria and
by committing to not sell such goods or services to non-unauthorized resellers;

    - no limitations may be imposed on any supplier of spare parts to freely sell such goods to
independent or authorized distributors or garages or end-users; and

    - no restrictions may be imposed on suppliers of components for the initial assembly of
motor vehicles limiting their ability to place their own trademark or logo effectively and
easily on the components supplied or on spare parts.

Furthermore, the European Commission may declare that both the General BER and the New BER
are not applicable where parallel networks with similar competition restraints cover more than
50% of a relevant market.

The agreements relating to the sale and distribution of spare parts which do not fulfill the
conditions of the General BER and/or of the New BER (which, according to the European
Commission, is likely to be the case for most agreements) may nonetheless benefit from an
individual exemption if they fulfill the conditions provided in Article 101(3) of the TFEU.

105


-----

In this regard, however, notice no. 2010/C 138/05 (European Commission’s Supplementary
Guidelines on Vertical Restraints in Agreements for the Sale and Repair of Vehicles and for the
Distribution of Replacement Parts for Vehicles) (“notice 2010/C 138/05”), which provides some
guidelines on the application and interpretation of the New BER, further specifies that it is very
doubtful that selective distribution agreements that would contain any of the two following
restrictions could benefit from an exemption under Article 101(3):

  - failure for the motor vehicle manufacturer to provide independent operators (including
independent repairers, spare parts manufacturers and distributors, manufacturers of repair
equipment or tools, publishers of technical information, automobile clubs, roadside
assistance operators, operators offering inspection and testing services, and operators
offering training for repairers) with appropriate access to the brand-specific technical
information required to perform repair and maintenance work on branded motor vehicles
in fair competition with authorized garages and distributors; and

  - explicit or implicit reservation of repair services by the supplier to the members of its
authorized network only. As Recital 69 of notice no. 2010/C 138/05 clarifies, the legal or
extended warranty may not, for example, be conditioned either (i) on the obligation for
the end-user to have the repair and maintenance services not covered by the warranty
performed by a member of the network or (ii) on the obligation for the end-user to use
spare parts branded by the manufacturer in respect of replacements not covered by the
warranty.

The foregoing provisions aim essentially to foster access to the repair and maintenance services
marketed by independent garages and facilitate the identification of compatible spare parts of
alternative suppliers, thereby fostering competition between such articles (known as
“equivalent” parts) and those bearing the manufacturer’s trademark.

As further specified by the European Commission in notice no. 2010/C 138/05, the New BER also
aims to protect access by spare parts suppliers to the motor vehicle aftermarkets, thereby
ensuring that competing brands of spare parts continue to be available to both independent and
authorized repairers, as well as to parts wholesalers. The European Commission emphasizes that
the availability of such spare parts entails significant advantages for consumers especially since
there are often large differences in price between parts sold by the manufacturer and alternative
parts. In particular, the following may be employed as substitutes for spare parts bearing the
manufacturer’s trademark: (i) original parts manufactured and distributed by original equipment
suppliers; and (ii) replacement parts of “equivalent quality” to the original components. In the
same notice, the European Commission specifies that in order to be considered to be of
“equivalent quality,” spare parts must be “of a sufficiently high quality that their use does not
endanger the reputation of the authorized network” that employs them. The European
Commission places the burden of proving that a part does not satisfy the requirements for being
considered of “equivalent quality” on the vehicle manufacturer.

In France, the New BER, as well as the General BER, are binding and directly applicable.
Accordingly, the French courts and the Competition Authority assess vertical agreements entered
into in the sectors of light vehicle and truck spare parts wholesale and repair and maintenance
services in light of these regulations and of the corresponding guidelines.

_Inspection_

European light vehicle inspections are currently regulated by the Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council of Europe dated as of May 6, 2009 (“Directive 2009/40/EC”), as
amended, providing for periodic technical inspections of each vehicle matriculated in a Member
State.

With regard to light vehicles with fewer than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat) and trucks
permitted to operate up to 3.5 tons, Directive 2009/40/EC requires inspections to be made (i) four
years after the first utilization and (ii) every two years thereafter. With regard to light vehicles
with more than eight seats (excluding the driver’s seat), trucks authorized to carry more than
3.5 tons, taxis and ambulances, such controls must be performed within one year from the first
utilization and every year thereafter.

106


-----

In France, the requirements set forth in Directive 2009/40/EC have been provided for in the
French Highway Code since 2004. If vehicles are not inspected when due, pecuniary penalties can
be imposed and may be increased for repeated violation or for vehicles on the road that were
suspended as a result of the inspection and may entail the confiscation of the vehicle registration
certificate (Articles R.323-1 et seq. of the French Highway Code).

_Protection of design and models for “visible” parts_

In the absence of EU harmonization, each Member State remains free to govern the legal
protection of designs and models for “visible” parts. In France, according to the French
Intellectual Property Code, the distribution of “visible” parts (such as wings, bumpers and
windscreens) is protected by industrial design rights. Consequently, only the manufacturer has
the right to distribute these parts to various repairers. However, it must be noted that the French
Competition Authority has recently recommended the gradual removal of the restriction on the
distribution of “visible” spare parts destined for repairs.

# Principal shareholders

Following the Transactions, the Target will be the direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BidCo and
CaymanCo will indirectly (through LuxCo 1, LuxCo 2, LuxCo 3, the Issuer, LuxCo 5 and BidCo as
wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries) own the majority of the share capital of the
Target. Bain Capital will control CaymanCo and hold all of its share capital. CaymanCo will
control LuxCo 1 and hold a majority of LuxCo 1’s total share capital, which includes ordinary
shares and PECs. LuxCo 1 will control LuxCo 2 and hold approximately 92.0% of the total share
capital of LuxCo 2. Certain other existing investors, including management, the Chairman of the
Target Group and certain Affiliated Distributors will hold approximately 8.0% of the ordinary
and preferred share capital of LuxCo 2. See “—Management equity plan.” On or about the
Completion Date, Bain Capital may syndicate a portion of its security holdings in LuxCo 2 to
third-party investors.

### Preferred Equity Certificates

In connection with the formation of CaymanCo, CaymanCo issued ordinary shares to Bain Capital.
In connection with the formation of LuxCo 1, LuxCo 1 issued ordinary shares to CaymanCo. In
connection with the financing of the Acquisition by Bain Capital, LuxCo 1 will issue preferred
equity certificates (“PECs”) and ordinary shares to CaymanCo. LuxCo 2 will issue PECs, preferred
shares and ordinary shares to LuxCo 1, and ordinary shares and preferred shares to the

# Description of certain financing arrangements

### New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement

**_Overview and structure_**

On or prior to the Completion Date, LuxCo 5 and BidCo will enter into a new revolving credit
facilities agreement between, among others, LuxCo 5 and BidCo as Holdcos, J.P. Morgan Limited,
Credit Suisse International and BNP Paribas S.A. as Arrangers, the financial institutions named
therein as original lenders, the institution named therein as Agent and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited
as Security Agent (each as defined therein) (the “New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement”).
Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will accede to the
New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement as a Borrower and as a Guarantor (each as defined
therein).

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for borrowings up to an aggregate
principal amount of €40 million on a committed basis. The committed facility made available
under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) may
be utilized by any current or future Borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facilities in euro,
pounds sterling and U.S. dollars and any other currency approved by the lenders by the drawing
of cash advances, the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit and by way of ancillary
facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, amounts may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed at any
time. Borrowings will be available for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and, without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, for capital expenditure, acquisitions and investments not prohibited
under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the refinancing of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s existing liabilities under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and/or
certain transaction costs.

In addition, subject to certain conditions, the Total Commitments under and as defined in the
New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement may be increased at any time up to an amount which,
together with any other credit facilities or debt securities ranking pari passu with the New
Revolving Credit Facility in right of payment and right to receive proceeds from an enforcement
of the Collateral, would not exceed the basket for such permitted credit facilities or debt
securities under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture, either by way of (i) an
increase in the total commitments in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) the
inclusion and making available of commitments in respect of one or more additional facilities.

**_Availability_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions
precedent, be utilized until the date falling one month prior to the termination date of the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, upon accession, become a Borrower and Guarantor under
and as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. The New Revolving Credit
Facility will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined therein), the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors within an agreed period
following the Completion Date. A mechanism is included in the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement to enable any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries in France,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and any other agreed jurisdiction to accede as an Additional
Borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions.

**_Maturity and repayment requirements_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the
Completion Date and (ii) the date falling six months prior to the final maturity date of the Senior
Secured Notes (or any refinancing thereof).

Each utilization of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such

112

date. All outstanding amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on
or prior to the maturity date for the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

The interest rate on cash advances under the New Revolving Credit Facility is the rate per annum
equal to the aggregate of the applicable margin and EURIBOR or LIBOR (as applicable). The
margin under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be 3.50% per annum for the first twelve
months of its term. From the date falling twelve months from the Completion Date and subject
to certain conditions, the margin on utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be
subject to a ratchet as follows:

**Margin**
**Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio:** **(percent per annum)**

Greater than 3.50:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%

Equal to or less than 2.00:1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50%

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the
New Revolving Credit Facility from (and including) the Completion Date to (and including) the
last day of the availability period for the New Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee is
payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability period of the New Revolving
Credit Facility and on the date the New Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date
on which a lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the overdue amount.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the agent under
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (the “New Revolving Credit Facility Agent”) and
the Security Agent in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the
Existing Intercreditor Agreement and fronting fees to the issuing bank under the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement and letter of credit fees to the Lenders in an amount equal to the
margin of the New Revolving Credit Facility with respect to an issuance of letters of credit
(subject to certain conditions and exclusions).

**_Guarantees_**

Each Guarantor under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will provide a senior
secured guarantee of all amounts payable to the finance parties by each other obligor (including
any additional borrowers which accede to the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement)
(subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the security
_interests”)._

**_Security_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. In
addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility may from time to time benefit from certain
guarantees and security, in addition to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, which do not
guarantee or secure the Senior Secured Notes.

Under the terms of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) will be required
to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility in
priority to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Representations and warranties_**

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will contain certain customary representations
and warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other
qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain representations and warranties being

covenants and related definitions (with certain adjustments) that apply to the Senior Secured
Notes and/or the PIK Notes. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will also

brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual
knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.

**_Notes purchase condition_**

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will provide that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or the Issuer (as relevant) may prepay/redeem/repurchase/defease/otherwise retire for value any
Senior Secured Notes or Notes prior to their scheduled maturity (a “Note Purchase”) without any
obligation to make any pro rata prepayment of the New Revolving Facility commitments where
such redemption or repurchase is (a) made: (i) pursuant to a change of control under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or Indenture (as relevant), to the extent that this does not constitute a
change of control under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement; (ii) from the proceeds of
any indebtedness which refinances any Senior Secured Notes or Notes; or (iii) from the proceeds
of new equity subscriptions, debt subordinated to the New Revolving Credit Facility in right of
payment, amounts available to be distributed to the Target in accordance with the New

the Notes; over the life of the New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding for these purposes any
fees, make whole payments, call premiums and other amounts not constituting principal with
respect to such Note Purchase) (the “Note Purchase Basket”).

Where the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Issuer (as relevant) makes Note Purchases in excess
of the Note Purchase Basket (an “Excess Redemption”) and which are not otherwise made in
accordance with paragraph (a) above, the total New Revolving Credit Facility commitments shall
be prepaid and cancelled in the same proportion until the total New Revolving Credit Facility
Commitments have been reduced to not more than €20,000,000.

**_Additional covenants_**

The additional covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain financial information,

**_Covenant suspension_**

The provision for suspension of certain covenants upon the Senior Secured Notes achieving
investment-grade status as set forth in “—Senior Secured Notes,” shall also apply equally to the
New Revolving Credit Facility.

114


-----

**_Mandatory prepayment requirements upon a change of control or a sale_**

Upon a sale of all or substantially all assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries, the New Revolving Credit Facility will be cancelled and all outstanding utilizations
and all outstanding amounts under any ancillary facility, together with accrued interest, and all
other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents (as defined in the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement) shall become immediately due and payable and shall be repaid within three
business days of such date.

Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and
includes, subject to certain conditions, an Adverse Corporate Decision (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement)) the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement (the “New Revolving Credit Facility Lenders”) shall not be obligated to fund
utilizations (other than rollover loans), and if a New Revolving Credit Facility Lender requests and
gives notice to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agent, within 30 days of receiving notice of such
Change of Control, that its commitments be cancelled the New Revolving Credit Facility Agent
shall promptly notify the Target, within five business days from such notice, that such New
Revolving Credit Facility Lender shall be required to be prepaid or replaced and its commitments
cancelled.

**_Financial covenant_**

Under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, we will be required to test the drawn
super senior leverage covenant, being the ratio of drawn super senior net debt under the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement to consolidated pro forma EBITDA, of 0.7:1 (the “Drawn
Super Senior Leverage Covenant”) if, on any Test Date (commencing on the first Test Date to
occur after two full Test Periods have elapsed after the Acquisition Closing Date), the Test
Condition has been met. The financial covenant is calculated and tested quarterly, provided that
exceeding the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant on any Test Date should only result in a
drawstop under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and shall not constitute or result
in a default or an event of default and shall not operate as a drawstop in respect of any rollover
loans or other rollover utilisations).

To the extent that the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant has been exceeded on a Test Date,
subject to certain limitations as more fully detailed in the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may cure that covenant (i) automatically where the
Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant is not exceeded on the following Test Date or the Test
Condition is not met on the following Test Date or (ii) through the receipt of new shareholder
injections and/or subordinated shareholders loans by the date falling no later than 20 business
days after the date that the quarterly financial statements for that relevant period were due to
be delivered, in an amount sufficient to, subject to certain limitations and at the election of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, ensure such Drawn Super Senior Leverage Covenant would have
been met had the proceeds from such new shareholder injection or subordinated shareholder
loan been applied (A) towards consolidated pro forma EBITDA or (B) in reduction of drawn super
senior net debt immediately prior to the end of the relevant period.

“Relevant Period” means each period of twelve months ending on or about the last day of each
Test Date.

“Test Condition” means, on any Test Date, the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans under
the New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility
by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees) or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized to
fund any OID) on the last day of the Relevant Period exceeds 35% of the total New Revolving
Credit Facility commitments as of such date or if higher, the total New Revolving Credit Facility
commitments as at the date of the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.

“Test Date” means each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31.

“Test Period” means the period commencing on the day immediately following a Test Date and

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of
which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications,
exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate, including: (i) misrepresentation;
(ii) unlawfulness and invalidity; (iii) breach of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement; and (iv) the
repudiation and rescission of finance documents.

**_Governing law_**

or in connection with it are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English
law although the restrictive covenants certain information undertakings and certain events of
default, which are included in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, are interpreted in
accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by, English law).

### Senior Secured Notes

**_General_**

On January 31, 2014, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer issued €240.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of notes (the “2014 Senior Secured Notes”) and on May 15, 2015, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer issued an additional €60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of notes (the “2015
Senior Secured Notes” and together with the 2014 Senior Secured Notes, the “Senior Secured
Notes”), pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On or about the Completion Date, the
Seller will cause the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to redeem €30.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes.

**_Maturity and interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes mature on February 1, 2019. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest at
a rate equal to 6.5% per annum, payable semi-annually on each August 1 and February 1 of each
year, commencing on August 1, 2014 for the 2014 Senior Secured Notes and August 1, 2015 for
the 2015 Senior Secured Notes.

**_Ranking_**

The Senior Secured Notes are senior secured obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
rank senior in right of payment to all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and rank pari passu in right of
payment with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so
subordinated, including the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations.

The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Target, a société par
_actions simplifée organized and existing under the laws of France and Autodistribution S.A., a_
_société anonyme organized and existing under the laws of France (together, the “Senior Secured_
Notes Guarantors”). The guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the respective Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such
guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including such Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Senior Secured Notes are secured by (i) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock, bank
account and intragroup receivables of the Target, (ii) a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (iii) first-priority security interests over substantially all of the
assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including a first-priority pledge of the capital stock of
Autodistribution S.A., Magenta Auto Pièces S.A. and SDFM S.A. held by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, a first-priority pledge over its bank account and a first-priority pledge over its intragroup

receivables, (iv) a first-priority pledge of (A) the capital stock of Commerce Rechange
Automobiles S.A.S., Cofirhad S.A.S. and AD Grand Ouest S.A.S. held by Autodistribution S.A.,
(B) Autodistribution S.A.’s material bank account and (C) Autodistribution S.A.’s intragroup
receivables and (v) a first-priority pledge of the issued capital stock of ACR Holding S.A.S.
(collectively, the “Target Group Collateral”). On the Completion Date, LuxCo 5 and BidCo will
accede to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as security providers in accordance with the
requirements under such indenture to allow the portability of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees thereof may, subject to certain agreed security
principles and limitations under applicable law, be released under certain circumstances.

**_Redemption_**

On or after February 1, 2016, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or a part of the
Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices set out below, if redeemed during the twelvemonth period beginning on February 1 of the years indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2016 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 103.250%

At any time prior to February 1, 2016, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds of
certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 106.500% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date, provided that least 60% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding after each such redemption and the
redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such equity offering.

At any time prior to February 1, 2017, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem during each
calendar year up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes at a
redemption price of 103.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also redeem part of the Senior Secured Notes, at any time
prior to February 1, 2016, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes, plus an applicable premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part,
at any time, if, as a result of certain changes in tax law the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is or
would be required to pay additional amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. If the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes plus interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

**_Change of control_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides that if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer experiences a
change of control, each holder of the Senior Secured Notes will have the right to require the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Senior Secured Notes at
a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.
Notwithstanding, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if certain
consolidated leverage ratios are not exceeded in connection with such event (the “Specified
Change of Control”). The relevant ratio is expected not be exceeded at completion of the
Acquisition, and we expect to qualify the Acquisition as a Specified Change of Control. No more
than one Specified Change of Control can occur under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

117


-----

**_Events of default_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains customary events of default, including, without
limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults, certain cross-defaults to mortgages, indentures
or other instruments, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults.

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture contains covenants for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes that, among other things, limit the ability of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries and the Target, among others, to:

  - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

  - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

  - make certain other restricted payments;

   - create or permit to exist certain security interests;

  - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

  - impose restrictions on the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

   - transfer, lease or sell certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

  - merge or consolidate with other entities;

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

  - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

These limitations are, however, subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. If
the Senior Secured Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s and no default has occurred and is continuing, certain covenants, including those
governing the incurrence of debt and the limitation on restricted payments, will be suspended.

(ii) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security, promptly upon giving
effect to that release, replacement Transaction Security is, subject to applicable

125


-----

law, granted in favour of the Security Agent for and on behalf of the providers
and/or agents and/or trustees of the New Debt Financing and the existing
Secured Parties benefiting from the security on substantially the same terms as
the Transaction Security released (except that it shall also secure any New Debt
Financing); and

(c) to the extent customary legal opinions as to due capacity, authority, execution and
enforceability (together with customary supporting legal documentation, certificates
and resolutions) are issued in relation to re-taken, new or amended Transaction
Security Documents in connection with a New Debt Financing, the Security Agent shall
be entitled to rely on such legal opinions and shall receive documentary evidence of

paragraph in respect of any New Debt Financing; and

paragraph in relation to a New Debt Financing.

Each Agent and Security Agent party to the Senior HoldCo Intercreditor Agreement is irrevocably

the provisions of this paragraph on behalf of the relevant creditors without the requirement for

Agent or other creditor to execute any document if it would impose personal liabilities or
obligations on, or adversely affect the rights, duties or immunities of the Security Agent, that
Agent or creditor (provided that the incurrence of such New Debt Financing, and ranking such
New Debt Financing as Senior Liabilities (or any other ranking permitted by the Senior HoldCo
Intercreditor Agreement), shall not be construed as adversely affecting the rights of any such
creditor) and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a commitment to advance or
arrange any New Debt Financing.

The Issuer will issue €239.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.000%/9.750% Senior HoldCo
Pay-If-You-Can Notes (the “Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of November 12, 2015 (the
“Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer, LuxCo 3, as security provider, U.S. Bank Trustees
Limited, as trustee (in such capacity the “Trustee”), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security
agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include
terms of, or be subject to any of the provisions of, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. The Notes will be secured by the Collateral as described under “—Security.”

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer,
together with the proceeds from the Equity Contribution, to (i) fund the consideration payable
for the shares of Autodis Group S.A.S. (the “Target”) and (ii) pay the estimated fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, including commitment, placement, financial
advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees, as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Use of proceeds.” Pending the consummation of the
Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Initial
Purchasers will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date,
deposit the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the “Escrow
_Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the_
Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch, as
escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to
April 15, 2016 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to
100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate
applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such calculation) and Additional
Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”

Unless and until the Completion Date occurs, the Issuer will not control the Target or any of its
Subsidiaries and none of the Target nor any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the
Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would
otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such
entities after the Issue Date and prior to such entities becoming Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €239.0 million
aggregate principal amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. We may issue an unlimited
principal amount of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the
“Additional Notes”). We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the

Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain covenants—
_Limitation_ _on indebtedness” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation_ _on liens”)._ Except as
otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any
Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including,
without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase
_provided that, if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal_
income tax purposes, such Additional Notes, as applicable, will be issued under a separate

references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture and the Notes will be subject to the terms of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The
terms of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness,
procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover
obligations, release of security, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description _of_ _certain_ _financing_ _arrangements—Senior_ _Holdco_ _Intercreditor_
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the
Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Notes
is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents for
complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents
are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with
respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not
be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

  - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that
are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

  - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated obligations of the Issuer;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the property
and assets securing such obligations; and

  - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the
Issuer, including the Senior Secured Notes, borrowings outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility, trade payables and lease obligations.

The Issuer is a newly formed holding company incorporated for the purposes of issuing the
Notes, with no material operations of its own and only limited assets. Prior to the Completion
Date, the Issuer’s only Subsidiaries will be LuxCo 5 and BidCo. Following the Completion Date,
the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, after the
Completion Date, the Issuer will depend on the receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in
the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to
intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The
Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other
liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer to receive assets, or proceeds from the sale thereof, of any of
its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of
the Holders to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that
Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the
Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinate in right of payment to
any security in the assets of the Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary senior to that
held by the Issuer.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However,
under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Restricted subsidiaries and

130


-----

_Unrestricted Subsidiaries” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as_
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to any of
the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Although the Indenture contains limitations on the
amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the
amount of such additional Indebtedness could be substantial.

As of August 31, 2015, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, on a consolidated basis,
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had €526.9 million of financial debt
outstanding, €239.0 million of which is represented by the Notes and €270.0 million of which is
represented by the Senior Secured Notes. We expect the Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn
on the Completion Date.

**Principal and maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €239.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes.
The Notes will mature on November 15, 2020. The Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 9.000% per annum with respect to Cash Interest
(as defined below) and 9.750% per annum with respect to any PIK Interest (as defined below).
Interest on the Notes will be paid semi-annually from the Issue Date or the most recent interest
payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for, whichever is later. Interest will be
payable on each Note on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2016.
Interest will be payable to Holders of record on each Note in respect of the principal amount
thereof outstanding as at the immediately preceding May 1 or November 1, as the case may be.
Interest on overdue principal and interest, including Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if
any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than Cash Interest. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

In connection with the payment of PIK Interest on, and any Additional Amounts with respect to,
the Notes, the Issuer is entitled, without the consent of the Holders, to issue Additional Notes
having the same terms and conditions as the Notes. Any issuance of Additional Notes will be
subject to all covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the
caption “—Certain covenants—Limitation on indebtedness.” The Notes and any Additional Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture; provided that unless such Additional
Notes are issued with a separate ISIN, such Additional Notes shall be fungible with the relevant
series of Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references to the “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the
_Notes” includes references to any Additional Notes that are issued._

Except as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence and the definition of “Cash Available
_for Debt Service,” interest on the Notes shall be payable entirely in cash (“Cash Interest”). For any_
interest period after the initial interest period (other than the final interest period ending at
stated maturity), if the Cash Available for Debt Service (as defined below) as determined on the
Determination Date (as defined below) for such interest period:

(i) equals or exceeds 75%, but is less than 100% of the aggregate amount of Cash
Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the
Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 25% of the then outstanding
principal amount of the Notes by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding
Notes or by issuing Additional Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest (“PIK
_Interest”);_

(ii) is equal to or exceeds 50%, but is less than 75%, of the aggregate amount of Cash
Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the
Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 50% of the then outstanding
principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest;

131


-----

(iii) is equal to or exceeds 25%, but is less than 50%, of the aggregate amount of Cash
Interest that would otherwise be due on the relevant interest payment date, then the
Issuer may, at its option, elect to pay interest on up to 75% of the then outstanding
principal amount of the Notes as PIK Interest; or

(iv) is less than 25% of the aggregate amount of Cash Interest that would otherwise be
due on the relevant interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect to
pay interest on up to 100% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes as
PIK interest;

_provided that, if the average daily balance of cash and Cash Equivalents (net of any amount_
drawn in cash and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and any local working capital
facilities and net of any cash that cannot be lawfully distributed by any Restricted Subsidiary to
the Issuer, such Restricted Subsidiaries having used commercially reasonable effort to avoid such
unlawfulness) of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries during the period starting on the 45th
day preceding the relevant interest payment date and ending on the 15th day preceding such
interest payment date the “Minimum Cash Balance” is less than (i) €35.0 million or (ii) if the
Issuer has, directly or indirectly, acquired any businesses (each an “Acquired Business”) since the
Completion Date, (x) €35.0 million, plus (y) 45% of the Consolidated EBITDA of each Acquired
Business for the twelve months immediately preceding the acquisition of such Acquired Business,
in each case determined on a pro forma basis to give effect to the payment of any Cash Interest
payable under the Notes on such interest payment date, then the Issuer may, at its option, elect
to pay PIK Interest on the Notes in such amount so that the Minimum Cash Balance would have
been (i) €35.0 million or (ii) if the Issuer has acquired any Acquired Businesses, (x) €35.0 million,
plus (y) 45% of the Consolidated EBITDA of each Acquired Business for the twelve months
immediately preceding the acquisition of any such Acquired Business, in each case determined on
the same basis. In such circumstances, it shall deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and
the relevant Paying Agent (upon which the Trustee and the Paying Agent may conclusively rely)
on or prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the relevant interest payment date, which
Officer’s Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail the Issuer’s determination of such pro
_forma calculation._

The insufficiency or lack of funds available to the Issuer to pay Cash Interest as required by the
preceding paragraph shall not permit the Issuer to pay PIK Interest in respect of any interest
period, and the sole right of the Issuer to elect to pay PIK Interest shall be as (and to the extent)
provided in the immediately preceding paragraph.

As used herein:

“Cash Available for Debt Service” shall be the amount equal to the sum (without duplication) of:

(i) the aggregate of all cash and Cash Equivalents on hand at each of the Sponsor SPVs
and the Target as of such Determination Date that may lawfully be used to make a
dividend or other distribution prior to the relevant interest payment date on any such
Restricted Subsidiary’s equity (other than any cash and Cash Equivalents the
distribution of which was conditioned upon such cash and Cash Equivalents being used
for a purpose other than paying Cash Interest and other than an amount necessary to
maintain the corporate existence of such Restricted Subsidiary and carry out activities
not prohibited by the Notes, the Indenture or the Revolving Credit Facility, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of interest on any Parent Senior Notes (as
such term is defined in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior
_Secured Notes Indenture”) (such amount with respect to any such Restricted_
Subsidiary, a “Maintenance Amount”)), net of all taxes attributable solely to such
payments or distributions, if any; and

(ii) without double counting, all cash and Cash Equivalents on hand at the Issuer as of
such Determination Date (other than the Issuer’s Maintenance Amount, which amount
shall in no event be less than €0 (provided that there shall be excluded from this clause
(ii) any net proceeds from the Notes, as applicable, and any Cash and Cash Equivalents
on hand to be used for payment of interest on the interest payment date immediately
succeeding such Determination Date; and provided further that the Issuer or the
Sponsor SPVs shall retain and continue to hold at all times until the date of the first

semi-annual interest payment under the Notes has been paid in cash, an amount in
cash from the net proceeds of the Notes (which amount may be distributed to LuxCo 3
or any of its Parents (each, a “Sponsor HoldCo,” and together, the “Sponsor HoldCos”)
if replaced by a corresponding amount from another source) sufficient to pay the first
semi-annual interest payment on the Notes in cash; and

(iii) without double counting, the maximum amount of all dividends and other distributions
that, as of the applicable Determination Date, would be lawfully permitted to be paid to
the Issuer for the purpose of paying Cash Interest by all Restricted Subsidiaries after giving
effect to all corporate, shareholder or other comparable actions required in order to make
such payment, requirements under applicable law and all restrictions on the ability to
make such dividends or distributions that are otherwise permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from
_restricted subsidiaries” (including any restrictions and limitations in the Revolving Credit_
Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, other debt of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than debt under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture) in existence on the Completion Date or any agreement that amends,
modifies, renews, increases, supplements, refunds, replaces or refinances such debt in the
manner prescribed by such covenant) pursuant to the “restricted payments” covenant
(including the “general basket” and “consolidated net income build-up” in respect
thereof but excluding the other exceptions in respect thereof) and similar distribution
mechanisms contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and any other instrument or agreement governing debt of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Incurrence and terms of which do not violate the terms of the
Notes or the Indenture, net of all taxes attributable solely to such dividend or distribution,
if any, and, in each case, without regard to whether any such Restricted Subsidiary shall
have any funds available to make any such dividends or distributions.

To the extent the Issuer is required pursuant to the third preceding paragraph and the definition
of Cash Available for Debt Service to pay Cash Interest for all or any portion of the interest due
on any interest payment date, the Issuer shall and shall cause each of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to take all such shareholder, corporate and other actions necessary or appropriate to permit the
making of any such dividends or other distribution or other form of return on capital provided
that any such shareholder and corporate and other actions would not violate applicable law.

For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this section, an amount will be deemed not to be
lawfully distributable or payable if its distribution or payment would constitute a breach of
European Union Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011/61/EC and any legislation
in implementation thereof.

“Determination Date” shall mean, with respect to each interest period following the first interest
period, the 15th calendar day immediately prior to the first day of the relevant interest period.

In the event that the Issuer is entitled to pay PIK Interest for any interest period, then the Issuer shall
deliver a notice to the Trustee (copied to the Paying Agent) following the Determination Date but
not less than five Business Days prior to the commencement of the relevant interest period, which
notice shall state the total amount of interest to be paid on such interest payment date and the
amount of such interest to be paid as PIK Interest. The Trustee shall promptly deliver the same notice
to the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of such notice to the Trustee shall not
restrict the Issuer’s ability to pay, at its option, a greater portion of the interest on the Notes with
respect to such interest period as Cash Interest. Interest for the first interest period commencing on
the Issue Date shall be payable entirely in Cash Interest. Interest for the final interest period ending at
stated maturity shall be payable entirely in Cash Interest.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the payment of accrued interest in connection with
any redemption or repurchase of the Notes as described under “—Optional redemption,”
_“—Change of control” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary_
_stock,” will be made solely in cash._

The Issuer will make all payments, if payable in cash, in same day funds. Payments on the Global
Notes will be made to the common depositary as the registered holder of the Global Notes.

133


-----

Interest, if payable in the form of Additional Notes, on the Global Notes will be payable by the
Issuer delivering an order to increase the principal amount of any such Global Note by the
relevant amount (rounded up to the nearest whole euro) or, if necessary, by issuing a new Global
Note executed by the Issuer and an order to the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) to
authenticate such new Global Note under the Indenture. Interest, if payable in the form of
Additional Notes, on any Definitive Registered Notes will be payable by the Issuer delivering to
the Trustee and Paying Agent such Additional Notes in the relevant amount (rounded up to the
nearest whole euro) as definitive registered Notes and an order to authenticate such Notes. If the
Issuer pays a portion of the interest on the Notes as Cash Interest and as PIK Interest, such Cash
Interest and PIK Interest shall be paid to Holders pro rata in accordance with their interests.
Following an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding Global Notes as a result of a
payment as PIK Interest, the Notes will bear interest on such increased principal amount from
and after the date of such payment.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is
not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will
not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place,
and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to make dividends or
distributions to the Issuer pursuant to the baskets in their debt instruments is subject to
important limitations. See “Description of certain financing arrangements” and “Risk factors—
_Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The Issuer will be a holding company with no_
_business operations or assets.”_

We estimate that, as of August 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, we would have
had no “restricted payment” capacity under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (the general
restricted payment basket being fully utilized and the “build-up” basket being negative by
approximately €12 million) and approximately €30 million of “restricted payment” capacity under
the Revolving Credit Facility. As long as both instruments remain outstanding, the most restrictive
“restricted payment” test under such instruments will apply. Our restricted payments capacity is not
necessarily an indication of our cash position on such date or any date in the future.

**Paying agent and registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London. The Issuer
will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a European Union member state that will not be
obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, including through European Union Council
Directive 2014/48/EU, or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting
of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the “Directive”), or any law
implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The initial
Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) in Ireland and a transfer agent (the “Transfer
_Agent”) in the City of London. The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, and the_
initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch. The Registrar, Transfer
Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the
Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Issuer will cause the Registrar to promptly inform the Issuer of any
amendment made to the register of the Notes in order to enable the Issuer to maintain, at all times,
at its registered office an up-to-date copy of the register of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, in
the case of divergence between the register of the Notes kept at the Registrar’s specified office and
the register of the Notes kept at the Issuer’s registered office, the register of the Notes kept at the
Issuer’s registered office shall prevail for Luxembourg law purposes.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. For so long as Notes are listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of
any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent on the official website of the Irish Stock

134


-----

Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may instead
be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the
Irish Times). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of
the Notes.

**Transfer and exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest
coupons, as follows:

  - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A
Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

  - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more
fully under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and
Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
(the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by
the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule
144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was
transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation
required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant
Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance
with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer restrictions.”

135


-----

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. In connection with
any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder
to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with
such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the
Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register
the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(i) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(ii) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(iii) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date; or

(iv) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with
a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled
to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted
Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption**

**_Escrow of proceeds_**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter
into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Initial
Purchasers of the Notes will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross
proceeds of the Offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow
Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of
the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to an escrow charge dated the
Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited
in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other
property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer to be used to
fund the Acquisition (the “Escrow Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have
received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined
below), an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that:

(i) (A) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly following the release of the Escrowed
Property and (B) no provision of the Acquisition Agreement shall have been amended
or waived in any manner which would be materially adverse to the interests of the
holders of the Notes;

(ii) promptly following release of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer will own, directly or
indirectly, substantially all of the outstanding Capital Stock of Target;

(iii) promptly following release of the Escrowed Property, the Issuer and LuxCo3 shall
enter into the Security Documents; and

(iv) as of the Completion Date, there is no Default or Event of Default under clause (5)
under the heading entitled “Events of default.”

136


-----

The Escrow Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above
(the date of such satisfaction, the “Completion Date”). The Escrow Agent and the Trustee will be
entitled to receive and rely absolutely on the Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer in relation to the
satisfaction of such conditions, without further investigation or liability. Upon the Escrow
Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero and the Escrowed Property shall be paid
out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

**_Special mandatory redemption_**

In the event that (i) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to April 15, 2016 (the
“Escrow Longstop Date”); (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not
be consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date; (iii) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any
time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date; (iv) a Default or Event of Default arises under clause (5)
under the heading entitled “Events of Default”; or (v) Bain Capital Europe LLP ceases to
beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Issuer, in each case, on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the
date of such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem the entire
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at
a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue price of such
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash
Interest for purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (with a
copy to the Paying Agent), and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no
later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay the Euro amounts to the Paying Agent
for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s
Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property
(if any) to the Issuer.

Funds managed or advised by Bain Capital Europe LLP (“Bain Capital Fund”) will enter into an
agreement with the Issuer on or prior to the Issue Date (the “Bain Capital Funding
_Commitment”) to commit to contribute an amount (the “Bain Capital Overfunding Amount”) to_
the Escrow Account in the event of any Special Mandatory Redemption no later than one
Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, which amount represents 100%
the Overfunding Amount (as defined below). The Bain Capital Fund currently has unfunded
capital commitments from its members in excess of any Overfunding Amount and has agreed in
the Bain Capital Funding Commitment to maintain in force such commitments and to leave such
commitments in an amount necessary to satisfy the Overfunding Amount undrawn until the
earlier of (i) the Escrow Release and (ii) the fulfillment by the Bain Capital Fund of its obligations
under the Bain Capital Funding Commitment.

The “Overfunding Amount” will be an amount equal to the sum of (i) the interest that will
accrue on the applicable portion of the Notes from the Issue Date up to the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date, (ii) any Additional Amounts (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”) due on
the Notes at the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and (iii) an amount equal to any other
amounts, fees and expenses required to be paid under the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture.
The funds from the Bain Capital Funding Commitment will be applied by the Trustee to provide
for the payment of the Overfunding Amount, to the extent and as applicable, on the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date.

If at the time of the Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Irish Stock
Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating
to the Special Mandatory Redemption.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the
release of the Escrowed Property) and, to the extent such provisions relate to the Issuer’s
obligation to redeem the Notes in the Special Mandatory Redemption, the Indenture, may be

137


-----

waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of the Notes without the
consent of at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes effected thereby.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes will be secured, subject to the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement (other than with
respect to the security interest granted over the Escrowed Property) and certain perfection
requirements, by security interests granted on an equal and ratable first-ranking basis over the
following property, rights and assets:

(a) on the Issue Date, the Escrowed Property; and

(b) on the Completion Date,

(i) all issued Capital Stock of the Issuer;

(ii) all the preferred equity certificates issued by the Issuer; and

(iii) the Issuer’s bank account (the “Completion Date Collateral” and together with
the Escrowed Property, the “Collateral”).

The Issuer and the Security Agent will enter into certain security agreements defining the terms
of the Collateral that secures the Notes (the “Security Documents”). Subject to certain conditions,
including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of
_security interest” and “—Certain covenants—Limitation on liens,” the pledgors of the Collateral_
are permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, permitted under the
Indenture.

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes, and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted
under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of
assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. Please see the section
entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The value of the
_pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy_
_the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, and it may be difficult to realize the value of the_
_pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account.” No appraisals of the Collateral have been_
prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the Offering. There can be no
assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the
Indenture and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to
satisfy amounts due on the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and
may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at all.

The Security Documents are governed by applicable local laws. The Liens on the Collateral will be
limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and
defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such
limitations, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the security interests.”

The Issuer shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such
assurances as the Security Agent may require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to
the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to
be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (ii) if such Security
Document is enforced in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security
Document and the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or
any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Document and for facilitating the
exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver
of all or any part of the Collateral. The Issuer will execute such transfers, conveyances,
assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and
give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.

138


-----

The Indenture will also provide that the Security Documents may be enforced only upon an
acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default. The Indenture
and the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the
applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on
behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual
provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject
to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.
Each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the Security Agent as its agent under the
Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such. Neither the Trustee nor the Holders may,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the
Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Security Agent
will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents that is in
accordance with the Indenture without requiring any consent of the holders.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and
the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be
secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and
the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of
_liens.”_

**_Release of liens_**

The Collateral will be released from the Liens over such Collateral under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(a) in relation to the Escrowed Property only, upon the release of the Escrowed Property
from the Escrow Account in accordance with “—Escrow _of_ _proceeds;_ _special_
_mandatory redemption”;_

(b) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain covenants—
_merger and consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not violate the_
covenant described under “—Certain covenants—limitation on sales of assets and
_subsidiary stock”;_

(c) upon repayment in full of the principal, interest and all other obligations due on the
Notes;

(d) upon the Legal Defeasance, Covenant Defeasance, satisfaction and discharge of the
Notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and discharge,” in each case,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture;

(e) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”; or

(f) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or the relevant Security
Documents.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Impairment of security interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action requested
by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes, in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior
Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any
action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The
Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving
rise to a release of Liens has occurred, and that such release fully complies with the Indenture.

139


-----

**Senior Holdco intercreditor agreement; additional Senior Holdco intercreditor agreements;**
**agreement to be bound**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any
further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled “Description of
_certain financing arrangements—Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be
deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the
provisions in the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;
and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter
into and comply with the provisions of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—The
_security interest in the pledged shares, the PECs and the bank account securing the Notes will be_
_granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the_
_Security Agent to take enforcement action with respect to collateral may be limited.” and_
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant
described under “—Certain covenants—Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreements.”

**Optional redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for taxation reasons,” the
Notes are not redeemable until November 15, 2016. On and after November 15, 2016, the Issuer
may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of the Notes so redeemed) plus accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to
the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts (as
defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right
of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on November 15 of the
years indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2016 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102.000%

Prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the original principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including the original
principal amount of any Additional Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice,
with funds in an aggregate amount (the “Redemption Amount”) not exceeding the Net Cash
Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 109.000% of the principal
amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to
the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original
principal amount of any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remain
outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

140


-----

In addition, prior to November 15, 2016, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of
the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and
unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such
calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption
date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date).

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note the greater of:

(a) 1% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) 101.000% of the principal
amount of such Note, plus (2) all required interest payments due on such Note to
and including November 15, 2016, (excluding accrued but unpaid interest),
computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund
Rate (or zero if greater than the Bund Rate) at such redemption date plus 50
basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty
of the Trustee or any Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of
direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant
maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has
become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior
to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any
publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board of Directors
or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the
redemption date to November 15, 2016; provided, however, that if the period from the
redemption date to the November 15, 2016, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct
obligation of the Federal Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the
Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a
year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany for
which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to
November 15, 2016, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall
be used.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes at a price of at
least 100% of the principal amount of the Notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such
calculation) to, but excluding, the applicable tender settlement date, if holders of Notes of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchase all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all
Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender
offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash
Interest for purposes of such calculation), if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption
Date.

The Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third
parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and
at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuer or any such affiliates may
determine.

141


-----

**General**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and notice”
below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on
the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, inform the Irish
Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the
related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity
Offering), any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption
date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided,
_however, that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on_
which such notice is first given), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**No sinking fund**

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory
redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Redemption at maturity**

On November 15, 2020, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed
or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such
calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date).

**Selection and notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form
as discussed under “Book-entry, delivery and form,” based on a method that most nearly
approximates a pro rata selection as the Issuer deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise
required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. The Trustee, the Paying
Agent and the Registrar will not be liable for any selections made in accordance with this
paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with
general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) and in addition to such
publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such
notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear
on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may instead be published
on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the

142


-----

name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the
case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the
terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and
after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption.

**Redemption for taxation reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for
purposes of such calculation), if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under
“—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption
Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a
result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below)
affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written
interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes, and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in
Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue
Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or
amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Any notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the
procedures described under “—Selection and notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication
or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver
to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by
taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the effect that the Payor has been or will
become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will
accept and shall be entitled to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

143


-----

**Withholding taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer (including any successor entity) (each, a “Payor”)
in respect of the Notes, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for,
or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on
behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax, by any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Note, including payments of principal, redemption
price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (in the form of (i) in the case of PIK Interest, additional PIK Interest, and
(ii) in other cases, cash) (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by the relevant Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or
deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not
be less than the amounts which would have been received by such Holder in respect of such
payments on any such Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however,
that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the
existence of any (actual or deemed) present or former connection between the
relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder
is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note or the Indenture;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure
by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written
request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable
notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable),
to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make
any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to
such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or
part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of
the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment
date or the date on which the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
the Holder or beneficial owner (except to the extent that the Holder or beneficial
owner would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented
on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a
payment on the Notes;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

144


-----

(6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual
pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced
in order to conform to, such Directive;

(7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf
of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by
presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another
Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(8) any Taxes imposed pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (or
any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable) or otherwise
imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (or
any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law or regulation
implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The
Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain and provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing
the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies or other reasonable
evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be
made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices
of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the
Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee
shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in
any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in
such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and (where applicable) reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or
future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or
similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or
enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, the Indenture, or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a
transfer of the Notes after this Offering and limited solely to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8)).

145


-----

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture,
any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction
in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with
respect to the Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
_“Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or_
any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of
€100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101.00% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for
purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase
Notes as described under this heading, “Change of control,” in the event and to the extent that
it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and that all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice
of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and all conditions to such
redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any
Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has
the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101.00% of the principal amount of such Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest
for purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control
_Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the
Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not
tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture,
that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the
Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the
Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

146


-----

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such
Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer;
and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for
purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes,
and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate
and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes
a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is
at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily
newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the
Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer
to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from
seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of
Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change
of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the
consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the
Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change
of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, certain events that may constitute a
change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Note Indenture and
require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may
also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require
such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under,
or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to
the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—We
_may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes_

147


-----

_upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_
_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
_substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a_
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder
may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent
of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain covenants**

**_Limitation on indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that (a) the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect
to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof),
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at
least 2.0 to 1.0; and (b) LuxCo 5 and any other Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma
effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds
thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for LuxCo 5 and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have
been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following
Indebtedness (“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit
Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or
created thereunder) and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and
Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of €60.0 million and 75% of
Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness
permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a)(i) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is

the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of any joint venture in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the
greater of €15 million and 1.9% of Total Assets; and

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _liens,”_
Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Issuer is the obligor on any such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is
unsecured and if the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness of the

148


-----

Issuer exceeds €10.0 million, to the extent legally permitted (the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the
reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect
such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness) and except if in respect of intercompany
current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
the cash management operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, it is
expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of its obligations with
respect to the Notes, pursuant to the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall be
deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not
permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the (i) Notes issued on the Issue Date, (ii) an
unlimited principal amount of Additional Notes issued from time to time in
payment of accrued interest or Additional Amounts on the Notes, but not
including any other Additional Notes or (iii) any “parallel debt” obligation under
the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(e) Management Advances; or

(f) any loan or other instrument contributing the proceeds of the Notes or any loans
pursuant to which the proceeds of any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to the Indenture are on-lent to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (a) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any
acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which (A) any
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or (B) any assets are acquired and related liabilities are assumed
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5),
at the time of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro forma effect
to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,
in the case of any such acquisition or other transaction (x) immediately following
which such Person would be merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
acquired by or combined with the Issuer, either (A) the Issuer (or any Successor Issuer,
if not the Issuer) would have been permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (a) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other
transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, or (y) immediately

149


-----

following which such Person would be (or would be merged, consolidated,
amalgamated or otherwise acquired by or combined with) any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer, either (A) LuxCo 5 would have been permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant
or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for LuxCo 5 and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or
other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity
Hedging Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings,

which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not
exceed at any time outstanding the greater of €15.0 million and 1.9% of Total Assets;
provided that the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or
improvement or is created within 365 days thereafter;
(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer,
in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or
the first paragraph of this covenant, provided that all Indebtedness outstanding on
the Completion Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first
paragraph or clause (4)(d) of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) in any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to any
provision of this covenant and/or may be secured in accordance with the “Limitation
_on liens” covenant is or may be based on Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA, the_
amount that may be Incurred and/or secured under such provisions shall be deemed to
include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, restructure,
defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred and/or secured pursuant to such
provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the maximum
amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur and/or secure pursuant to
this covenant and the “Limitation on liens” covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded, with respect to such Incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of
fluctuations in the amount of Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and/or Lien will be permitted to be refinanced
or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or
replacement, such excess will continue);

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise
included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as
Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14) or (15) of the second paragraph
above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness
shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the
maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case,
any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to
one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount
thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on
the basis of IFRS; and

(8) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness (including PIK Interest), the payment of dividends in the form
of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant
described under this “—Limitation on indebtedness” covenant, nor to be the
Incurrence of a Lien under the “Limitation on liens” covenant, provided that the Lien
securing such originally Incurred Preferred Stock or Indebtedness was secured in
accordance with the Indenture. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of

152


-----

any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued
with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference
thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and,
if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under this “—Limitation on indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness
denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or
first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in
clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target
and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement
(with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such
agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on layered indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer unless such
Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, on substantially
identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being
secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall, other payment
ordering, standstill or release provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on restricted payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in
respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any
payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock) or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in
the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution,

153


-----

to holders of its Capital Stock other than the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other
than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled
repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other
than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of
payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase,
repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated

manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in (8) above have been
entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €20.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10
Business Days thereof to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset
Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in

162


-----

respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an
offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (in the case of the Notes, using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for
purposes of such calculation) and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate
purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to
be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any
such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting
any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the
Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of
any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon
converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer
_Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer_
Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of
Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1 in excess thereof. The Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business
Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering
Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly
issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating
agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new
Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000. Any Note not so
accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer
prior to the expiration of the 365-day period mentioned in this covenant.

163


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under
the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale,
lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer
(any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €7.5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or
the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of
€15.0 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been
approved by a resolution of the majority of the disinterested members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation _on_ _restricted_ _payments”_ (other than pursuant to clause
(9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_restricted payments”), and any agreement related to any such Restricted Payments, or_
any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs
(1)(b), (2) and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding, Capital Stock, options,
other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants
in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto or
Parent Expenses;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or with an
entity that is not an Affiliate that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables
Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or
contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, and with respect to the

164


-----

Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the Completion Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to
the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the
entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement pursuant to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is required or
permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in
the ordinary course of business; provided, that payments under such Tax Sharing
Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described
under clause (7) of the definition of “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax
liabilities of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any
Affiliate of the Issuer (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or an Associate or similar
entity, including any joint ventures, that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preference Shares) of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such

a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination
and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) without duplication of the payments referred to under items 6(b) and (c) of the
definition of “Parent Expenses”, (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent)
of management, consulting, monitoring or advisory fees in an aggregate amount not
to exceed (i) prior to the second anniversary of the Completion Date, €2.5 million per
annum and (ii) thereafter, the greater of €2.5 million and 3% of Consolidated EBITDA
per annum and, in each case, related expenses and (b) customary payments by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing,
underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with loans, capital market transactions, acquisitions
or divestitures, and payments related to the reimbursement of reasonable out-ofpocket expenses Incurred by a Permitted Holder in connection with its Investment in
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which payments (or agreements providing for
such payments) in respect of this clause (11) are approved by a majority of the Board
of Directors in good faith;

(12) any transactions in respect of which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a
written opinion (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the
Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair
to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on
terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction
at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(13) any contribution to the equity of the Issuer in exchange for Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock) or any investments by any of the Permitted
Holders in securities of any Restricted Subsidiary (and the payment of reasonable out
of pocket expenses of the Permitted Holders in connection therewith);

165


-----

(14) pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a CICE
Financing; and

(16) Investments by Affiliates in Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries, so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the preceding
paragraph, (ii) non-Affiliates were also offered the opportunity to invest in such
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock on the same or more favorable terms and (iii) in the
case of securities, the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue amount of such
securities; and transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of
Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so long as such
transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders)
and such Affiliates are treated no more favorably than all other holders of such class
generally.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) (i) within 120 days after the end of the Target’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, annual reports containing: (A) information with a level

_financial condition and results of operations” and “Business” in the offering_
memorandum relating to the Senior Secured Notes; (B) unaudited pro forma income
statement and balance sheet information of the Target together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have

previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; (C) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Target as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and

material operating activities except through the Target and its Subsidiaries, a
reasonably detailed reconciliation of the Issuer’s consolidated results to the

shareholders of the Issuer and the Target, all material affiliate transactions and a

the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal
year of the Target, beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, quarterly
financial statements containing the following information: (A) the Target’s unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to

forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without

166


-----

unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (C) an operating and financial
review of the unaudited financial statements; and (ii) if the Issuer conducts any
material operating activities except through the Target and its Subsidiaries, a

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer or the Target
announces publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar
transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Issuer or the Target or a
change in auditors of the Issuer or the Target, a report containing a description of
such event,

The Issuer may comply with the requirements of clauses (1) and (2) of this “Reports” covenant by
providing consolidated financial information and reports of the Issuer and its subsidiaries instead
of the Target.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all
reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website, and, if and so long as the Senior Secured
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the
Global Exchange Market thereof and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Irish
Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made
available at the specified office of the listing agent in Dublin, Ireland.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS (or in the case of
any statutory financial information of the Issuer, IFRS or Lux GAAP) as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS or Lux GAAP, as applicable
as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be
described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods. Except as provided below, no report need include any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth
above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the
entity or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Target’s (a) total
revenue or Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly
financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day
of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to
the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to
file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the
provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls
and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual

167


-----

reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file
with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). The Issuer may comply with any
requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by providing any
report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer so long as such reports (if
an annual or quarterly report) include in footnote form, condensed consolidating financial
information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent on a combined basis;
(v) consolidating adjustments; and (vi) the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and consolidation_**

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person,
unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
(the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and
the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and
(b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the
Successor Issuer, as applicable, would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as applicable, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the
case of the Successor Issuer, such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of
the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or
the Notes.

168


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Center of main interests and establishments_**

Each of LuxCo 3 and the Issuer will, for the purposes of The Council of the European Union
Regulation No. 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings Regulation”)
or otherwise, ensure that its center of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the
Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) is situated in its original respective jurisdiction of
organization and ensure that it has no “establishment” (as that term is used in Article 2(b) of the
Insolvency Proceedings Regulation) in any other jurisdiction where to do so could reasonably be
expected to adversely and materially affect the interests of the holders of the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of LuxCo 3 and the Issuer may sell, convey, transfer, lease or
dispose of all or substantially all their respective assets or consolidate with or merge into any
Person to the extent doing so would not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders
of the Notes, and in the case of the Issuer, would not violate the provisions of the covenant
entitled “Merger and Consolidation.”

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, each of LuxCo 3 and the Issuer will:

(1) hold all meetings of its board of directors in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg);

(2) keep any share register, preferred equity certificate register, notes register, official
corporate books and account records in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; and

(3) exercise its administration in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

**_Impairment of security interest_**

None of LuxCo 3 or the Issuer shall take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and none of LuxCo 3 or the Issuer
shall grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement or any Senior Holdco Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens,
(ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable
Security Documents or the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to
time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein,
(iv) LuxCo 3 and the Issuer, as applicable, may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does
not adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect and (v) LuxCo 3, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake a Permitted Reorganization; provided, however, that in the
case of clause (i) or (iv) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously
with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming
the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the
Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created
under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released,
modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement.

169


-----

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified
and secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding) consent to such amendments
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on issuance of guarantees of indebtedness of the Issuer_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall
Guarantee the Indebtedness of the Issuer Incurred pursuant to a Credit Facility or Public Debt of
the Issuer unless such Restricted Subsidiary executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
provide Guarantees of the Notes; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to Guarantee the Notes to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such
Guarantee may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (a) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules
or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for
the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or
regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (b) undertaken in
connection with, such Guarantee which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary. At the option of the Issuer, any Guarantee
may contain limitations on such guarantor’s liability to the extent reasonably necessary to
recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose,
capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Guarantees of the Notes granted pursuant to this provision shall be released at the option
of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or
(ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue
Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of
such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee
and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee of the Notes in accordance
with these provisions.

**_Additional Senior Holdco intercreditor agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Issuer of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with
respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional _Senior_ _Holdco_ _Intercreditor_
_Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Senior Holdco_
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the
Security Interests; provided that such Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement.

170


-----

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to any Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types
of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject
to any such agreement (including with respect to any Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or
(8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in
any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to
request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,”
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment
to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their
respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable)
shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes
thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described
under “—Limitation on restricted payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee
and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement.
A copy of the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on
any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of the listing agent.

In relation to the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or, to the extent applicable, an
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall be deemed to have
consented on behalf of the holders of the Notes to any payment, repayment, purchase,
repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated
to the Notes thereby; provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant described
under “—Limitation on restricted payments.”

**_Payments for consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an
inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the
Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid
to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in
the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of
consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms
or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude holders of Senior Secured Notes in any
jurisdiction where the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection

171


-----

with an offer to purchase for cash, or the payment of the consideration therefor, would require
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar
document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States
federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the
Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome
(it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s)
used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the
securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would
otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Limitation on Issuer activities_**

The Issuer may not carry on any material business or own any material assets other than, without
limitation:

(1) the issuance of the Notes and entering into the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, and any activities undertaken with the purpose of
fulfilling its obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as well as any other finance
document relating to Indebtedness not prohibited to be Incurred under the Indenture
and any related finance or security document;

(2) the provision of administrative services (including treasury services), strategy, legal,
accounting and management services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided
by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the ownership of assets and employment
of personnel necessary to provide such services;

(3) ownership of the shares of its Subsidiaries and conducting activities related to, or
reasonably incidental to, the establishment or maintenance of its or its Subsidiaries’
corporate existence;

(4) (a) ownership of cash and Cash Equivalents; and (b) other property and assets, in each
case, for the purpose of transferring such cash, Cash Equivalents, property and assets
to any Parent or Subsidiary;

(5) Incurring Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(6) (a) Incurring any other Indebtedness not prohibited by the Indenture, and the Senior
Holdco Intercreditor Agreement; (b) conducting any activities reasonably incidental to
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, including the performance of the terms and
conditions of such Indebtedness; and (c) the granting of Liens to secure such
Indebtedness as well as the Notes in compliance with the Indenture;

(7) making any payment, distribution, or Investment not prohibited by the Indenture and
the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) the sale, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposal of any assets not prohibited under the
Indenture;

(9) (a) the listing of its Capital Stock and the issuance, offering and sale of its Capital
Stock (including in a Public Offering), including compliance with applicable regulatory
and other obligations in connection therewith, (b) using the net cash proceeds of such
issuance, or exchanging or converting such instruments, to fund the purchase,
repurchase or redemption of, any Indebtedness or other equity or debt instrument of
the Issuer, or to contribute to the common equity of its direct Subsidiaries, to the
extent permitted or not prohibited by the Indenture; and (c) any purchase, repurchase,
redemption, or the performance of the terms and conditions of, and exercise of rights
in respect of, the foregoing, to the extent such activities are otherwise permitted or
not prohibited by the Indenture;

(10) the granting of Liens permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Liens”;_

172


-----

(11) conducting activities directly related or reasonably incidental to, or in connection with,
the Transactions;

(12) other transactions of a type customarily entered into by holding companies;

(13) the performance of obligations and exercise of rights under contracts or arrangements
with any Management Investors; and

(15) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature or
that are of the same nature as activities exercised by the Issuer on the Issue Date.

**_Suspension of covenants on achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have
Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized
under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) _“—Limitation on restricted payments;“_

(2) “—Limitation on indebtedness”;

(3) _“—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries”;_

(4) _“—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;_

(5) _“—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock”;_

(6) _the provisions of clause (3) of the covenant described under “—Merger and_
_consolidation,”_

(7) _“—Limitation on Issuer activities,”_

(8) _“—Center of main interests and establishments,”_

(9) _“—Impairment of security interest,” and_

(10) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and
will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from
the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on restricted payments” covenant and
the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” will be
interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the
continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness of the Issuer and a
Sponsor SPV Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have
been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on indebtedness” and all
Indebtedness of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred during the continuance of the
Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Completion Date, so that it
classifies as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on indebtedness.”

Furthermore, (a) any transactions prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions” entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered_
into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6)(ii) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,”
and (b) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any
action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on restrictions on distribution from restricted subsidiaries” that becomes effective
during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on restrictions on distributions
_from restricted subsidiaries.”_

173


-----

In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the
Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long
as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in
anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied,
provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants
described under this caption to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of
a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due
and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note
issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer, LuxCo 3 or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after
notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with the agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than Indebtedness owed
to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
€25.0 million or more.

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, LuxCo 3 or a
Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Target and its
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer, LuxCo 3 or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €25.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after
the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in
full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of €5.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full
of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in

174


-----

accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents, or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid
or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that
any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues
for 10 days; and

(8) failure by the Issuer to comply with any material terms of the Escrow Agreement that
is not cured within 10 days.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount
of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee,
may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of Cash Interest
for purposes of such calculation) on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate
applicable to the payment of Cash Interest for purposes of such calculation) will be due and
payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event
of Default described in clause (4) under the immediately preceding paragraph has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall
be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that
gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of
the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest (using the rate applicable to the payment of
Cash Interest for purposes of such calculation) on all the Notes will become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security
Documents and the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events
of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on the
Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security (including by way of prefunding)
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense caused by
taking or not taking such action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or
interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

175


-----

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion
against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will
provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence
by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days
after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in
respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action; and (ii) any Default or Event of
Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled
“—Certain covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any
other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction in its sole
discretion (including by way of prefunding). It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain
actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be
for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance
with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for Notes). However, without the consent

176


-----

of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) (or, alternatively, the
consent of each Holder affected thereby), an amendment or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at
which any Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional
_redemption”;_

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor
or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such
Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding
_taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material_
respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an
exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any
obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer
agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a
rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Indenture shall not include any provision incorporating, giving
effect to, or otherwise reflecting the provisions of Section 316(b) of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or
supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a guarantee of the Notes for the benefit of the
Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or
the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or
any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Notes;

(6) to provide a Guarantee of the Notes by a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on issuance of guarantees of indebtedness of the

177


-----

_Issuer,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or
retaking of any Senior Holdco Lien (including the Collateral and the Security
Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is
provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of
the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or
the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent
to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security
Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—impairment of security interest” is complied with;

(10) as provided in “—Certain _covenants—Additional_ _Senior_ _Holdco_ _Intercreditor_
_Agreement” or “—Certain covenants—Impairment of security interest”; or_

(11) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes
(provided that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of
163(f) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code).

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions
of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form
of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will
not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Ireland in a
daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times). Such
notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may instead be published on the website of
the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

**Acts by holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control
with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated,

178


-----

destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under
“Certain covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation”) and “—Change of control” and the default
provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee
provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its
prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with
respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in
clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under
“—Certain covenants—Merger and consolidation”), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Issuer
and LuxCo 3), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an opinion of tax counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial
owners of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred
(and in the case of legal defeasance only, such opinion of tax counsel in the United
States must be based on a ruling received from, or published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law occurring
after the Issue Date);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the
Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not
constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S.
Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the
Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving
rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated

179


-----

and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the
Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become
due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the
Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay
and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent
for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of
Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the
case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Indenture and all sums payable to the Trustee under the Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Senior Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; (4) the Issuer
has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may
be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been
complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters
of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Issuer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and certain agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture
and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent
becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such
Agent.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time
by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at
any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee
or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of
the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

180


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful default or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish
Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published on
the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf
of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may instead be published in a daily
newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or if, in
the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper
having general circulation in Europe.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made;
provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later
of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication
mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means
and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it
is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in
via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or
Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer
for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date
for payment of interest.

**Currency indemnity and calculation of euro-denominated restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer under or
in connection with the Notes, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a
currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able
to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first
date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note (as applicable), the Issuer will indemnify them against any loss sustained
by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient or
the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated
therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such
purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s
other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of
the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any
Note, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

181


-----

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to
admit the Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. There can be no assurance
that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit
the Notes on the Global Exchange Market will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption
price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United
States.

**Consent to jurisdiction and service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture
and the Notes, the Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal
and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States. The Indenture will provide that each of the Issuer and LuxCo 3 will appoint
CT Corporation System as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with
respect to the Indenture and the Notes brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court
located in the City of New York.

**Governing law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, changes to the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes shall be
permitted as described in the first sentence of “Amendments and Waivers.” The Senior Holdco
Intercreditor Agreement, the rights and duties of the parties thereunder and the Escrow
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The
Security Documents, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by
and constituted in accordance with the laws of Luxembourg.

Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) less the amount of cash and Cash
Equivalents that would be stated on the balance sheet of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
as of such date in accordance with IFRS.

“Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio” means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of
(x) Consolidated Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA
for the period of the four most recent fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such
determination for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available. In
the event that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays,
repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated
and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio is made (the “Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will
be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or
financial officer of the Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds
therefrom, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter reference
period and may give effect to cost savings or cost reduction synergies that have occurred;
_provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness_
Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation
Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred
pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain covenants—
_Limitation on indebtedness.”_

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions and Investments that have been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, including through mergers or consolidations, or any Person or any of its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries acquired by the Issuer or any of its

increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the
Calculation Date, or that are to be made on or substantially concurrently with the
Calculation Date or with all or a portion of the proceeds of any Indebtedness Incurred
on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith
by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer) as if they had occurred on
the first day of the reference period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued
operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or
group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests
therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account
anticipated cost reduction synergies resulting from any such disposal, as determined in
good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer responsible for
accounting or financial reporting);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets

190

constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of
prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such
disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to
have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such
Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate
Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is not
denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the
calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

(7) the difference between: (i) the total pro forma consolidated amount received or
receivable pursuant to CICE for the four-quarter reference period as determined on
the basis of CICE applicable to all relevant entities of the Group as at the end of the
period, and (ii) the total amount received or receivable pursuant to CICE already
included in Consolidated EBITDA for that period, shall be added to Consolidated
EBITDA.

For the purposes of this definition and the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Net Income, (a) calculations will be as determined in good faith
by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer (including in respect of anticipated
expense and cost reductions and synergies as though the full effect of such expense and cost
reductions and synergies were realized on the first day of the relevant period and shall also
include the reasonably anticipated full run rate cost savings effect (as calculated in good faith by
a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer) of cost savings programs, business
optimization programs, centralized purchasing programs, or other restructurings or
reorganizations that have been initiated by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as
though programs, restructurings or reorganizations had been fully implemented on the first day
of the relevant reference period (regardless of whether these cost savings and expense and cost
reduction and expense and cost synergies could then be reflected in pro forma financial
statements to the extent prepared); provided that such anticipated expense and cost reductions
and synergies and cost savings are reasonably anticipated to be realized within 18 months after
the consummation of the cost savings program, business optimization program, centralized
purchasing program, restructuring, reorganizations or any operational change or the purchase or
sale or other event which is expected to result in such anticipated expense and cost reductions
and synergies and cost savings), and (b) in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
on any date of determination and Fixed Charges for the relevant period, pro forma effect shall
be given to any Incurrence, repayment, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition, retirement
or discharge of Indebtedness as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the relevant
period.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Consolidated EBITDA and all outstanding Indebtedness of any
company or business to be acquired pursuant to a signed purchase agreement (which may be
subject to one or more conditions precedent) may be given pro forma effect for the purpose of
calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer or
LuxCo 5, as applicable.

described under the caption “—Certain covenants—Restricted payments.” For purposes hereof,
the amount of Disqualified Stock which does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated

# Book-entry, delivery and form

### General

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (the
“Rule 144A Notes”) under the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global
Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a common
depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of
the Euroclear system (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”)
and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) under
the U.S. Securities Act will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Restricted Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons who hold interests through such
participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the
Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of
certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants.
The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that
certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated
form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not
be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights
of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and none of the Paying Agent,
the Registrar or the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the
records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

### Definitive Registered Notes

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes if:

  - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary
for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor;

  - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

  - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
either Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the
Indenture.

215


-----

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its
current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in
“Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the
Transfer Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute
owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership
of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered
office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered
Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the
part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding
not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1 in excess thereof will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive
Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered
Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we
will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a
holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may
suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first
delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.
See “Transfer restrictions.”

### Redemption of the Global Notes

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for
cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the
Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect
the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests
will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection

216


-----

with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under
existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part.

### Payments on Global Notes

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, which will
in turn make such payments to the Common Depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
customary procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Notes—Withholding taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is
required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net_
amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such
deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have
otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be,
absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held
through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the
Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., Euroclear or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, none of us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or
the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a BookEntry Interest;

  - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

### Currency of payment for the Global Notes

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither we nor the Trustee nor
the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment.

217


-----

### Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only
at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking
of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its
participants.

### Transfers

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants,
which rules and procedures may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states
that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed in “Transfer restrictions.”

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the
legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption
(if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor or a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any
applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Notes only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes, See “Transfer restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease
to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest

218


-----

in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as
long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Application will be made to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official List of
the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing
their operations.

### Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures,
and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee
nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable or will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments
and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United
States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a
payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be
performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if
Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common codes for the Notes
are the same as the international securities identification numbers and common codes for the
Senior Secured Notes set forth under “Listing and general information—Clearing information.”

219

### Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within
the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and we
urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their
account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial
interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take action in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing industry
practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests
or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled
to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants
owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would
authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in
definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

# Tax considerations

### EU Savings Directive

Under the European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of
savings income in the form of interest payments (the “EU Savings Directive”), the competent
authority of each Member State of the European Union is required, since July 1, 2005, to provide
to the competent authority of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar
income) within the meaning of the EU Savings Directive (“Interest Payments”) made by a paying
agent within its jurisdiction to, or for the benefit of, an individual resident for tax purposes in
that other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member
State.

For a transitional period, Austria operates (unless during that period it elects otherwise) a
withholding system in relation to such payments (subject to a procedure whereby, on meeting
certain conditions, the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax
be withheld). The rate of this withholding tax is currently 35%. Luxembourg operated such a
withholding system until December 31, 2014 but the Luxembourg government has elected out of
the withholding system with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic information
exchange under the EU Savings Directive. The end of the transitional period is dependent upon
the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to the exchange of information with certain
other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories have adopted or agreed to adopt
similar measures.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Directive amending the EU
Savings Directive (the “Amending Directive”) which, when implemented, will amend and
broaden the scope of the requirements described above. In particular, the Amending Directive
will broaden the categories of entities required to provide information and/or withhold tax
pursuant to the EU Savings Directive, and will require additional steps to be taken in certain
circumstances to identify the beneficial owner of interest (and other income) payments, through
a “look through” approach. Member States will have until January 1, 2016 to adopt the national
legislation necessary to comply with this Amending Directive and are required to apply these new
requirements from January 1, 2017.

On December 9, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2014/107/EU
amending the Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the
field of taxation which now provides for an automatic exchange of financial account information
between EU Member States (the “DAC Directive”), including income categories contained in the
EU Savings Directive. The adoption of the aforementioned directive implements the OECD
Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) and generalizes the automatic exchange of information
within the European Union as of January 1, 2016.

The measures of cooperation provided thus by the EU Savings Directive will be progressively
replaced by the implementation of the DAC Directive. Under transitional arrangements, the EU
Savings Directive will continue to be operational until the end of 2015 and will then be replaced
by the DAC Directive as from January 1, 2016. As Austria has been allowed to start applying the
DAC Directive up to one year later than other Member States, special transitional arrangements
taking account of this derogation will apply to Austria. Provided the proposal to repeal the EU
Savings Directive is adopted by the Council of the European Union, the Luxembourg laws dated
June 21, 2005 implementing the EU Savings Directive will no longer apply and the amendments
to the EU Savings Directive, which had been adopted by the Council on March 24, 2014, will not
become applicable (the same is true in all other EU Member State).

In addition, Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement
(the “Multilateral Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS. Under this
Multilateral Agreement, Luxembourg will automatically exchange financial account information
with other participating jurisdictions as of January 1, 2016. This Multilateral Agreement, jointly
with the DAC Directive introducing the CRS are currently subject to the vote of the Luxembourg
Parliament under the bill of law No. 6858.

Holders of Note and prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisers
concerning the possible application of the provisions of the EU Savings Directive to payments
which they may receive in respect of the Notes.

### Certain Luxembourg tax considerations

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the Issuer’s understanding
of certain aspects of the laws and practice in force in Luxembourg as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax implications that
might be relevant to an investment decision. It is included herein solely for preliminary
information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax
advice. It is a description of the essential material Luxembourg tax consequences with respect to
the notes and may not include tax considerations that arise from rules of general application or
that are generally assumed to be known to holders of the Notes. This summary is based on the
laws in force in Luxembourg on the date of this Offering Memorandum and is subject to any
change in law that may take effect after such date. Prospective holders of the Notes should
consult their professional advisors with respect to particular circumstances, the effects of state,
local or foreign laws to which they may be subject and as to their tax position.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax,
duty, levy, impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax
law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax
encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax
(impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi),
personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu) as well as a temporary equalization tax (impôt
_d’équilibrage budgétaire temporaire). Corporate investors may further be subject to net wealth_
tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal
business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers
resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal
income tax, the solidarity surcharge and the temporary equalization tax. Under certain
circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Withholding tax_**

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect, there is no withholding tax on payments of
interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident holder of
Notes. There is also no Luxembourg withholding tax upon repayment of the principal, sale,
refund or redemption of the Notes.

_Resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of December 23,
2005, as amended (the “December 2005 Law”), as described below, there is no withholding tax
on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes,
nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax
payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.

Under the December 2005 Law payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a
paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for the benefit of an individual beneficial owner
who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 10%. Such withholding
tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the
course of the management of his or her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of the
tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent (as defined in the December 2005 Law).
Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the December 2005 Law would
be subject to a withholding tax of 10%.

Furthermore, a Luxembourg resident individual who acts in the course of his or her private
wealth and is the beneficial owners of interest or other similar income made by a paying agent
established outside Luxembourg in a Member State of the European Union or the European
Economic Area or in a jurisdiction having concluded an agreement with Luxembourg in
connection with the EU Savings Directive may opt for a final 10% levy. In such cases, the 10%

222


-----

levy is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg paying agents.
The option for the 10% final levy must cover all interest payments made by paying agents to the
beneficial owner during the entire civil year.

**_Luxembourg tax residency of holders of Notes_**

Holders of Notes will not be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in
Luxembourg solely by reason of the holding, execution, performance, delivery, exchange and/or
enforcement of the Notes.

**_Taxation of Luxembourg non-residents_**

Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who do not have a permanent
establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg with which
the holding of the Notes is connected, will not be subject to taxes (income taxes and net wealth
tax) or duties in Luxembourg with respect to payments received upon redemption, repurchase or
exchange of the Notes or capital gains realized upon disposal or repayment of the Notes.

Holders of Notes who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are
attributable, must include any interest accrued or received, as well as any gain realized on the
disposal of the Notes, in their taxable income for Luxembourg tax assessment purposes.

**_Taxation of Luxembourg residents_**

_Resident Individual holders of the Notes_

An individual holder of the Notes acting in the course of the management of his or her private
wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, accrued but unpaid
interest in case of disposal of the Notes, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the Notes
except if the 10% final withholding tax has been levied on such payments.

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realized upon the disposal of the Notes by an
individual holder of the Notes, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in
the course of the management of his or her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg
income tax, provided (i) the disposal takes place more than six months after the acquisition of
the Notes and (ii) the Notes do not constitute zero-coupon Notes.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of Notes acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any
interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in
any form whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.
“Taxable gains” are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price
(including accrued but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold
or redeemed.

_Resident corporate holder of Notes_

Luxembourg resident corporate holders of Notes and holders of Notes which are non-residents of
Luxembourg and which have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are attributable are liable to pay Luxembourg income
tax on any interest received or accrued, as well as any reimbursement premium received at
maturity and any capital gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes and must include this income in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax
assessment purposes.

Luxembourg resident corporate holders of Notes which are companies benefiting from a special
tax regime (such as family wealth management companies subject to the amended law of
May 11, 2007, undertakings for collective investment subject to the amended law of
December 17, 2010 or specialized investment funds subject to the amended law of February 13,
2007) are tax-exempt entities in Luxembourg, and are thus not subject to any Luxembourg tax
(i.e., corporate income tax, municipal business tax and net wealth tax) other than the annual
subscription tax calculated on their (paid-up) share capital (and share premium) or net asset
value.

223


-----

**_Net wealth tax_**

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on a corporate holder of Notes, unless (i) such
holder of Notes is a Luxembourg resident other than a holder of Notes governed by (a) the
amended law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, (b) and the
amended law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, (c) the amended law of
March 22, 2004 on securitization, (d) the amended law of June 15, 2004 on the investment
company in risk capital or (e) the law of May 11, 2007 on family estate management companies;
or (ii) the Notes are attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is carried on in
Luxembourg through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative.

**_Other taxes_**

No stamp, registration, transfer or similar taxes or duties will be payable in Luxembourg by
holders of Notes in connection with the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be
payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer or redemption of the Notes, unless the
documents relating to the Notes are voluntarily registered in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issuance of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the
transfer of the Notes. Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees
charged for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes
such services are rendered or are deemed to be rendered in Luxembourg and an exemption from
Luxembourg value added tax does not apply with respect to such services.

No estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the Notes upon the death of a holder
of Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax
purposes. No Luxembourg gift tax is levied upon a gift or donation of the Notes, if the gift is not
passed before a Luxembourg notary or recorded in a deed registered in Luxembourg.

### Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all
potential tax effects. This summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as
defined below), except for the discussion under “—Foreign account tax compliance act,” and
does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws
(such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This summary deals only
with Notes that are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), by a
U.S. holder who acquires the Notes pursuant to this Offering for cash at the price indicated on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

  - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

  - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations (the
“Treasury Regulations”) to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including provisions of the Code,
the Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date
of this Offering Memorandum, all of which are subject to change at any time. Changes in such
rules, or new interpretations thereof, may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect

224


-----

the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek
any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the
following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our
statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the
event of litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Notes than those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of
income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This summary is general in nature and does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal
taxation or all tax considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular
circumstances. In addition, it does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws.
For example, this summary does not address:

  - tax consequences to holders who are dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities
that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, banks,
financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, partnerships or other
pass-through entities and investors in such entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance
companies;

  - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated,
constructive sale or conversion transaction, or a straddle;

  - tax consequences to a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

  - tax consequences to U.S. expatriates or entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules;

  - tax consequences to persons who are not U.S. holders;

  - persons who are resident in France or any other jurisdiction other than the United States
or who have a taxable presence therein;

  - persons that actually or constructively own more than 5% of our voting stock;

  - alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax on
net investment income; or

  - any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S.
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partnership considering
an investment in the Notes, or a partner in such a partnership, you should consult your own tax
advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes.

**The following discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is for informational**
**purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning and advice. If you are considering**
**the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisor concerning the particular U.S.**
**federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the**
**Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under any other tax laws, under the laws of**
**any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that U.S. holders are
entitled to account for the Notes using a payment schedule in which all interest payments on the
Notes are initially assumed to be paid in cash in accordance with Section 1.1272-1(c) of the
Treasury Regulations. In such case, the Notes would not subject to the Treasury Regulations
applicable to “contingent payment debt instruments.” This position is based in part on our
assessment as of the Issue Date that it is significantly more likely than not that interest on the
Notes will be paid in cash on each interest payment date. Our assessment of the likelihood of
interest being paid in cash is made solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and does not
constitute a representation by us regarding the likelihood that interest on the Notes will be paid

225


-----

in cash in any particular period. In addition, we may be required to pay additional amounts if
certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under
“Description of the Notes—Withholding taxes”) or make additional payments in redemption of
the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under
“Description of the Notes—Change of control” and “Description of the Notes—Optional
_redemption”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the_
possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of
the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments
under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our
determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional
amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the
applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a
U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year
during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However,
our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above,
a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable
yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we
would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes would generally be recharacterized as
ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax
consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment
debt instruments.

**_Interest (OID)_**

Because interest on the Notes is not unconditionally payable in cash at least annually, the Notes
are considered to have been issued with “original issue discount” (“OID”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Under the rules governing OID, a U.S. holder of a Note will be required to accrue
an amount equal to the difference between the “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note
(generally, the sum of all payments to be made on the note other than “qualified stated
interest”) and the “issue price” of the Note (generally, the first price at which a substantial
amount of Notes are sold for money to the public, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). A U.S. holder generally must include OID in gross income (as ordinary income) in
advance of the receipt of cash or other property attributable to that income on a constant yield
basis, regardless of the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

As discussed under “—Characterization of the Notes,” to determine the amount of OID that a
U.S. holder must include in income, we are taking the position that we and each holder are
entitled to assume the interest on the Notes would be assumed to be paid in cash and the Notes
will not be called prior to the maturity date. These assumptions are made solely for U.S. federal
**income tax purposes and do not constitute a representation by us regarding the actual amounts,**
**or the timing of amounts, that will be paid on the Notes. If the assumptions we make are**
contrary to actual circumstances (a “change in circumstances”), then solely for purposes of
determining the amount of OID accruals on any then outstanding Notes, the Notes will be
treated as retired and reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal
to the “adjusted issue price” of the Notes (as defined below). In that event, the “yield to
maturity” of the Notes would be re-determined taking into account the change in circumstances
and the deemed reissued Notes could be retested for the application of the contingent payment
debt instrument rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the payment of PIK Interest.

The amount of OID that a U.S. holder is required to include in income is the sum of the “daily
portions” of OID with respect to the Notes for each day during the taxable year in which the
U.S. holder is the beneficial owner of the Notes. The “daily portions” of interest in respect of the
Notes are determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” the ratable portion of

226


-----

interest on the Notes that accrues in the “accrual period.” The accrual period for the Notes may
be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Notes, provided that each accrual
period is no longer than one year and that each scheduled payment of interest or principal occurs
on the first or final day of an accrual period.

The amount of interest on the Notes that accrues in an accrual period is the product of the “yield
to maturity” on the Notes (adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period) and the “adjusted
issue price” of the Notes. The yield to maturity on the Notes is the discount rate that, when
applicable to all payments under a Note (applying the assumptions described above), results in a
present value equal to the Note’s issue price. The “adjusted issue price” of the Notes at the
beginning of the first accrual period will equal its “issue price” and for any accrual periods
thereafter will be (x) the sum of the issue price of the Notes and any OID previously accrued
thereon minus (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Notes.

A U.S. holder will not be required to recognize any additional income upon the receipt of any
cash payment on a Note that is attributable to previously accrued OID, but such U.S. holder may
be required to recognize exchange gain or loss, as described below.

The accrual of OID on a Note will be computed in foreign currency, and the amount of accrued
OID determined for any accrual period then will be translated into U.S. dollars, regardless of the
U.S. holder’s method of accounting and in accordance with either of two methods. Under the
first method, a U.S. holder will be required to include in income for each taxable year the
U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by
translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which
such interest accrued. Under the second method, a U.S. holder may elect to translate stated
interest income at the spot rate of exchange on (i) the last day of the accrual period, (ii) the last
day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles its taxable year or (iii) the date on which
the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the
accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations held by the U.S. holder from year to
year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their
own tax advisors as to the availability and advisability of making such election.

Upon receipt of a payment attributable to OID on a Note (whether in connection with a payment
on such Note or the sale, exchange or other disposition of such Note), a U.S. holder generally will
recognize exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar
amount of OID that such holder has previously included in income and the U.S. dollar value of
such payment (determined by translating any foreign currency received at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of payment). Generally, any such exchange gain or loss will be treated as
U.S. source and will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest
income or expense. For this purpose, all payments on a Note generally will be viewed first as the
payment of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for
the earliest accrual periods first, and thereafter as the payment of principal.

U.S. holders that desire to obtain information regarding the OID on the Notes may do so by
contacting Dakar Finance S.A., Attn: Investor Relations. We will revise our accrual of OID upon a
change in circumstances, and holders that desire to obtain a copy of any such revised OID
information may do so by contacting us at the same address.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

A U.S. holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes, if any, imposed on interest
(including OID and additional amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election
to deduct or credit taxes applies to all of such U.S. holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a
particular tax year). OID on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally
will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to
U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a
U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax
credits are complex and depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

227


-----

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

If you sell or exchange an Note, or if an Note that you hold is retired, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the transaction
(less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest that you have not previously
included in income, which amount will be subject to tax in the manner described under
“—Interest (OID)”) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. If a U.S. holder receives foreign
currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note,
the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency
based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be
traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual
basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such
amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special
election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments
held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date,
and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by
such U.S. holder, increased by previously accrued OID and decreased by the amount of any
payments made on the Note (including payments of Cash Interest, but excluding payments of PIK
Interest). Although not free from doubt, in the event of a payment of PIK Interest, a U.S. holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the original Notes will likely be allocated between the original Notes and
the additional Note received in respect of PIK Interest thereon in proportion to the relative
principal amounts of the original Notes and the additional Notes. A U.S. holder’s holding period
in any additional Note received in respect of PIK Interest would likely be identical to such
holder’s holding period for the original Note. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a
Note, the amount paid for the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase
price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss
that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of an Note generally will be U.S.-source
capital gain or loss, and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note
for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) generally are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with
respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as
an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and will generally be treated as ordinary income or
loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal
amount” of a Note is the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss
attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of
such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the
principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder disposes of
the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the
spot rate on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may realize
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued OID, which will
be treated as discussed above under “—Interest (OID).” However, upon a sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will realize any
foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued
OID) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

228

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain
tax shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum
amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an individual or a trust), such as the receipt or accrual of
interest or OID or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency
note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect
to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals (and, under proposed Treasury Regulations, certain entities) that own “specified
foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally
are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The
Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting
requirements, unless the Notes are held in a financial account at certain financial institutions.

**_U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing_**
**_disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for_**
**_non-compliance_**

_Backup withholding and information reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated
interest (including the accrual of OID) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other
disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such
U.S. holder is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence
of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to
impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 28%, on such payments if: (i) the U.S. holder
fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from
backup withholding; (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number
furnished by the U.S. holder is incorrect; (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting”
described in Section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the U.S. holder has not certified under penalties
of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a United States
person, and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. holder that it is subject to backup withholding
under the Code.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability. You may obtain a refund of any excess
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for
a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

_Foreign account tax compliance act_

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
payments” made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six
months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru
payments” are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially
modified after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury
Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into, and others are expected to
enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a
manner that alters the rules described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding
under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no
additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

# Limitations on validity and enforceability of the security interests

### Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and is in principle also subject to
Luxembourg insolvency law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Luxembourg
insolvency laws.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as
“insolvency proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in
Luxembourg having its “center of main interests” in Luxembourg or an establishment in
Luxembourg within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000, or
the E.U. Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings):

  - insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company
or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may
commence insolvency proceedings if the Issuer: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
(cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open insolvency_
proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main
effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the
company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured
creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon
foreclosure of the assets;

  - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only
be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a
provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured
creditors. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the
creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in
order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration
(such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable
during controlled management proceedings; or

  - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only
be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its
creditors holding 75% at least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors
themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the relevant
Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de
_paiement) or to put the Issuer into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation_
proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing
an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial
code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended.
The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow rules similar to those
applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the Issuer in respect of the relevant Notes will,
in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings,
only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg
law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

  - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities;

  - value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise
authorities;

  - social security contributions; and

  - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

230


-----

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is
foreclosed upon), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges
arising mandatorily by law.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
during the period before insolvency, or the suspect period (période suspecte), which is a
maximum of six months from the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court formally
adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an
additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment
declaring insolvency, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the
suspect period at an earlier date, if the insolvency judgment was preceded by another insolvency
proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under
Luxembourg law.

In particular:

  - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce),
specified transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the
payment of debts that have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of
assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due
by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; or the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the
suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if
so requested by the insolvency receiver;

  - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for
matured debts as well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver
if they were concluded with the knowledge of the insolvent party’s cessation of payments;

  - regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and
Article 1,167 of the Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge
any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the insolvency; and

  - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial
collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Financial Collateral Law”), a financial collateral
arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into
force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and
binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators
notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg
Code of Commerce, if the secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such
proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not
reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, an insolvency order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the
identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the
insolvency order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so
as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of
insolvency, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the insolvency estate.
Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg
company’s business and assets and the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

The insolvency receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the insolvency order). The insolvency receiver may elect to continue
the business of the debtor, provided the insolvency receiver obtains the authorization of the
court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two
exceptions apply:

  - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an insolvency
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

231


-----

  - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes
an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of
the insolvency judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of
the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

The insolvency receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are
still to be performed after the insolvency under any agreement validly entered into by the
insolvent party prior to the insolvency. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for
damages in the insolvency and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may
not require specific performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg insolvency, controlled management or voluntary
arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used
in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company
has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation
that any such company has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its
registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main
interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.”
In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company
conducts the majority of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s
creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where a company
has its “center of main interests.” The time when a company’s “center of main interests” is
determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the “center of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the
EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the “center of main
interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have
jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an
“establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other
Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the
debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an
establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to
open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the Issuer’s “center of main interests” is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such
other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer.

**_Security interests considerations_**

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the
_lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or_
security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the
creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be
located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank account held

232


-----

with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors
located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through
an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over
such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in
accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity,
perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain
registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A receivables pledge agreement needs to
be acknowledged by the debtor.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies
available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event:

  - the direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with
a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged
assets;

  - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by
way of a public auction;

  - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured
obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

  - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on
(i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and
(iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and
appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law-governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may
not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the
powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the
Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction
because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main
insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under
Luxembourg law and such security interests or arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets
located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in
accordance of Article 5 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not
prevent any third-party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which
are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid
claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors
through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain
entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of
law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments
arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the
rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed
preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs
of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of
salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as social security
bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This
general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of
pledged assets.

233


-----

**_Financial assistance_**

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions
on financial assistance as defined by article 49-6 of the Luxembourg Companies Act or any other
similar provisions might not be enforceable.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the security documents, the Indenture and the transaction
documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the _Administration_
_de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines in Luxembourg may be required in the case of legal_
proceedings before Luxembourg courts or in the case that the Notes, the security interest
agreements, the indentures and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) must be produced before an official Luxembourg authority (autorité constituée). In
such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of
the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable
depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in
respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the
security documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or
German.

### Service of process

**_Luxembourg_**

It may, however, be possible for investors to effect service of process within Luxembourg
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters between the United States and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, courts
in Luxembourg will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a
U.S. court. A valid judgment against an issuer incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the
Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment
remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal
jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court
of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement
procedures (exequatur) set forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil
Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile), being:

  - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the
Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

  - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

  - the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law
(fraude à la loi);

  - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter
under its applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private
international and local law;

  - the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction where the decision has been
rendered;

  - the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following
proceedings at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the
necessary time to prepare its case and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and

  - the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the
laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature.

234


-----

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the
designated law and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international public
policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an
_exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Furthermore, in the event of any_
proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed
to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give
judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the
judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such
purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro.

# Plan of distribution

### General

The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement dated on or about
October 29, 2015. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the
Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally
and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at
which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates and agents, including
in respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer
will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers
may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practices of the country of purchase in
addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Sales of the Notes may be made
through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers or through registered brokers.

Investment funds or accounts advised or managed by entities affiliated with Bain Capital LLC may
purchase Notes in the Offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, subject to a rebate of the Initial Purchasers’
discount in respect of the Notes purchased by such funds upon the release of the applicable
proceeds from the Escrow Account on the Completion Date, and in the case of investment funds
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), subject to
the limitations of the 1940 Act. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers will not restrict the ability of the funds and the affiliates of Bain Capital LLC to buy or
sell the Notes in the future and, as a result, these investment funds and affiliates of Bain Capital
LLC may buy or sell Notes, subject to applicable securities laws, in open market transactions at
any time following the consummation of the Offering.

### Notes are not being registered

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in
reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Each purchaser of the
Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations and agreements
described under “Transfer restrictions.” The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the Notes
except to persons they reasonably expect to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to
offers and sales in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are
restricted as described under “Transfer restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale
of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and
(ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material

236


-----

relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes
may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes
in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to this Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum
and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.”

The Issuer has also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer,
sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by the U.S. Securities
Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and
sale of the Notes.

### No sale of similar securities

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided
under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guarantee by, the Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates (other than any securities issued by any funds managed or controlled by
Bain Capital or entities controlled by such funds which have no relationship or connection
otherwise with the Issuer or its subsidiaries or holding companies but are affiliates solely due to
the fact that Bain Capital has an equity interest in such entity) that are substantially similar to the
Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the
date falling 45 days after the date of this Offering Memorandum without prior written consent.

### New issue of securities

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on
the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the
Global Exchange Market thereof. No certainty can be given that this application will be granted,
and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop.

The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make
a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to
you. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an
_active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

### Initial settlement

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or
about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the
tenth business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act)
following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+10”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to such trades expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next six succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially
settle in T+10, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing
should consult their own advisors.

**_Price stabilization and short positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may
engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.

237


-----

Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may over-allot the Notes or
effect transactions, for a limited period after the Issue Date, with a view to supporting the
market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. The
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market for the purpose of
pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also create
syndicate short positions, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in
market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty
bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities
and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the
liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which_
_case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Any such
stabilizing action, if begun, may be ended at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of
30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. See “Risk
_factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active trading_
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_

### Other relationships

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and original
lenders under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and will be mandated lead
arrangers and original lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and are
counterparties in the hedging arrangements in connection with the Senior Secured Notes. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates will receive customary fees and commissions in such
capacities. J.P. Morgan Europe Limited will act as the agent and lender under our New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain affiliates of BNP Paribas are (i) minority
shareholders in a parent of the Target and are expected to receive certain proceeds from the
Acquisition, (ii) holders of a portion of the Contingent Value Instruments that we will repay in
full on or about the Completion Date using cash on hand and (iii) lenders under certain of our
bilateral lending facilities.

In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in
the past and may currently be providing and may provide in the future, investment banking,
commercial lending, consulting and advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary
course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us or our affiliates routinely hedge their
credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including (potentially) the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent
research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend
to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

_transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby._

state securities laws and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the
Notes are only being offered and sold:

  - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” or “QIBs” (as defined in Rule 144A)
in compliance with Rule 144A; and

applicable state securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom, or in a
transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the conditions for
transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) You are not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144A) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of

all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell these
Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other available exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and
on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing Notes issued in

Rule 144A Notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise
transfer such Rule 144A Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination
Date”) that is one year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date on which we
or any of our affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereto)
only:

(a) to us or any of our subsidiaries;

satisfactory to each of them and (ii) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of
transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the
transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each 144A Note will contain a legend substantially in the
following form:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR
OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY
BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT
FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF (1) REPRESENTS THAT IT IS A
“QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT), (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS
PURCHASED SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH NOTES, PRIOR TO THE
DATE (THE “RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE”) THAT IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF
THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THE NOTES (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THE
NOTES) ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF (B) PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES
ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A
UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A “QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT THAT
PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON

240


-----

RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE
TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE
EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND; SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY
SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY
OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO
EACH OF THEM, (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A CERTIFICATE OF
TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON THE REVERSE OF THIS NOTE IS COMPLETED AND
DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRUSTEE; AND AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH
PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF
THIS LEGEND. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” AND “UNITED STATES”
HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.”

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(5) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of
transfer any Notes acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory
to us and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(6) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy
of your acknowledgments, representations and agreements set forth herein and
you agree that, if any of your acknowledgments, representations or agreements
herein cease to be accurate and complete, you will notify us and the Initial
Purchasers promptly in writing; and

(b) if you are acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, you represent with respect to each such account that:

1. you have sole investment discretion; and

2. you have full power to make, and make, the foregoing acknowledgments,
representations and agreements.

(7) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer these Notes notice
of any restrictions on the transfer of the Notes.

(8) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the
United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public
offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of
the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of
_distribution.”_

(9) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, any
offer, sale or transfer of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or
not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act.

(10) You acknowledge that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and
agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements deemed to have been made upon your purchase of the
Notes are no longer accurate, you shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers in
writing. If you are acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, you represent that you have sole investment discretion with respect to such
investor account and that you have full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each
such investor account.

# Enforceability of judgments

### Grand Duchy of Luxembourg

The Issuer is a company incorporated and established under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg under the form of a société anonyme. All of its assets are located outside the United
States. Furthermore, none of the Issuer’s directors resides in the United States. As a result,
investors may find it difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer
or these persons or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against the Issuer or
these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it may also be difficult for an investor to
enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against the Issuer or these persons in courts located in
jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to bring an
original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws against the Issuer or these persons. Luxembourg law, furthermore, does
not recognize a shareholder’s right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the Issuer. It may be
possible for investors to effect service of process within Luxembourg upon the Issuer provided
that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil
or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The Indenture is, and the Notes will be, governed by the laws of the State of New York.
According to Luxembourg case law, a judgment rendered in respect of the Notes by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of New York would be recognized and enforced by a
Luxembourg court, without reconsideration of the merits, subject to the following conditions:

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must be enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

  - the U.S. court must have had jurisdiction according to the Luxembourg conflict of
jurisdiction rules;

  - the U.S. court must have applied to the matter submitted to it the proper law designated
by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered
in Luxembourg, which have not been confirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeals, no
longer apply this condition);

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must not have been obtained fraudulently, and must have
been made in compliance with procedural rules of the country in which it was rendered
and in particular the rights of the defendant; and

  - the judgment of the U.S. court must not be contrary to Luxembourg public policy.

The enforcement in Luxembourg of a judgment rendered in respect of the Indenture or the
Notes by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York will be subject to the rules of
civil and commercial procedure as applied by the courts of Luxembourg.

The term “enforceable” as used above is subject to all limitations by reason of liquidation,
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, controlled management, general settlement with creditors,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors of the Issuer generally.

Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal
action in Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent
provisional measures are concerned.

Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause, Luxembourg courts would in principle
have jurisdiction for any urgent provisional measures in connection with assets located in
Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law.

# Where you can find other information

Each purchaser of Notes from an Initial Purchaser will be furnished with a copy of this Offering
Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum. Each
person receiving this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this

review and has received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary to
verify the accuracy and completeness of the information contained herein;

(iii) except as provided pursuant to (i) above, no person has been authorized to give any
information or to make any representation concerning the Notes offered hereby other
than those contained herein and, if given or made, such other information or

Initial Purchasers.

We have agreed in the Indenture governing the Notes that, if at any time we are not subject to
Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or are exempt from reporting pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, we will, upon request of a holder of the Notes, furnish
to such holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustee or the Paying Agent for delivery to such
holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of the Notes, as the case may be, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act, to
permit compliance with Rule 144A thereunder in connection with resales of the Notes. Any such
request should be directed to the Issuer at 4, rue Lou Hemmer, L-1748 Luxembourg-Findel, Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg.

The Issuer is not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements
of the U.S. Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuer will,
however, agree to furnish periodic information to the holders of the Notes. See “Description of
_the Notes—Certain covenants—Reports.”_

**Statutory auditors’ review report on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements**

To the Chairman,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of Autodis Group and in accordance with your request in
connection with the offering of the Notes to be issued by Dakar Finance S.A. for financing the
proposed acquisition of Autodis Group, we have performed a review of the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements of Autodis Group for the eight-month period ended August 31,
2015, consisting of the unaudited consolidated statement of financial position of Autodis Group
as at August 31, 2015, the related unaudited consolidated statement of income, the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the
consolidated statement of changes in equity for the eight-month period ended August 31, 2015
with corresponding figures for the eight-month period ended August 31, 2014 together with the
related condensed footnotes thereto, the accompanying “Financial Information”.

The preparation of this Financial Information is your responsibility. Our role is to express a
conclusion on this Financial Information based on our review.

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. A
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Financial Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
IAS 34 — IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

Without modifying the conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to note 3.2 which
discloses the impacts of the application by your company of IFRIC 21 “Levies”.

This report is governed by French law. The courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction over
any claim, dispute or difference resulting from our engagement letter or the present report, or
any related matters. Each party irrevocably waives its right to oppose any action brought before
French courts, to claim that the action is being brought before an illegitimate court or that the
courts have no jurisdiction.

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Group will apply the above standards, amendments and interpretations on their respective
effective dates as endorsed by the European Union.

The Group did not exercise the option to adopt in advance these standards, amendments and
interpretations in the Interim Financial Statements as of and for the eight-month period ended
August 31, 2015 and does not expect that they would have a material impact on its results and
financial position except for IFRS 15 for which the study is ongoing.

**3.3. Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of Interim Financial Statements requires the Group to use judgments and make
estimates that can affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed frequently, and the effect of
changes in accounting estimates is accounted for from the date of revision.

In preparing these Interim Financial Statements, the significant judgments made by management
in applying the Group’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the
same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
31 December 2014.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty arising from the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial period could involve
a significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. The impairment tests are based on the five-year EBITDA
plan for each Cash-Generating Units (CGU) defined by the Group. For the purpose of impairment
testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs most likely to benefit from the
synergies of the business combination and to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by
the Group. The CGUs correspond to subsidiaries or group of subsidiaries that are included in the
same operating segment and that generate cash-flows largely independent from those
generated by other CGUs. The assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the
variability of the result following the changes of all assumptions. Each year and whenever there
is an indication of impairment, the Group carries out impairment tests. A valuation of the AD
brand is also performed separately, bearing in mind that the impairment of the brand is
reversible if events occur that show that indicators that led to a loss being recorded no longer
exist.

At end of August 31, 2015, the Group didn’t identify any indication of impairment. As a
consequence, no impairment tests were performed and no additional impairment provision or
reversal was booked.

**_Income tax rate_**

In the preparation of these Interim Financial Statements and in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”, the Group applied a projected income tax rate based on the best estimate
of the weighted average annual income tax expected for the full financial year ended
31 December 2015.

### 4. Financial risk management and financial instruments

**4.1. Financial risk factors**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including cash flow
interest rate risks, foreign exchange risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Interim Financial

# Notes to the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in
the annual financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual
financial statements as at 31 December 2014. There have been no changes in the risk
management or in any risk management policies since the year end.

**4.2. Fair value estimation**

The table in Note 19 “Presentation of financial assets and liabilities” analyses financial
instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as
follows:

- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).

- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).

- Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is
unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

### 5. Seasonality of operations

Due to the seasonal nature of the Group operations, lower revenue is usually expected in the
month of August and December of each year.

### 6. Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 25 and the amount of goodwill in Note 10.

**6.1. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the eight-month period ended 31 August, 2015.**

**_6.1.1. Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

There was no change in the scope of consolidation in the eight-month period ended 31 August,
2015.

**_6.1.2. Incorporation of companies_**

No companies were incorporated during the eight-month period ended 31 August, 2015.

**_6.1.3. Mergers within the Group_**

The Group carried out a simplified merger of the following entities in AM développement
renamed Comptoir Du Frein.

- Comptoir du frein

- Comptoir technique VI

- Boury VI

- H.I.S

- Comptoir technique du Limousin

The above transactions had no impact on the Group Interim Financial Statements.

**_6.1.4. Disposals_**

The Group did not dispose of any of its entities for the eight-month period ended 31 August,
2015.

**_6.2. Changes in the scope of consolidation for the eight-month period ended 31 August 2014_**

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 25 and the amount of goodwill in Note 10.

**_6.2.1. Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

**_Acquisition of shares in the ACR group by Autodistribution_**

On 7 April 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital and all of the voting rights of the
ACR group, comprising ACR Holding and ACR. The ACR group has been consolidated by the
Group since the date of acquisition.

### 20. Borrowings and debt

**20.1. Group financing**

On January 31 2014, the Group refinanced its long-term debt by means of a €240 million bond
issue on the Dublin market. These bonds pay interest at 6.5% on 1 February and 1 August each
year, and mature on 1 February 2019.

On May 15 2015, the Group completed its financing structure by means of a € 60.0M bond issue
on the Dublin market.

These bonds increase the existing March 2015 € 240.0M senior secured notes, to reach € 300.0M.
The gross proceeds of the added bonds are € 61.95M as issued price was 103.25%, all conditions
remaining the same, i.e: 6.5% interest rate, semi-annual interests payment dates on August and
February and a February 1, 2019 maturity.

This refinancing transaction generated an expense of around € 2.7M.

The Group had also negotiated a revolving credit facility (RCF) with JP Morgan for €20.0 million
at Euribor + 3.5%.

The Group doesn’t have to comply with any covenants except a minimum annual EBITDA
covenant of €37 million.

For the eight-month period ended 31 August 2015, Group financing can be broken down as
follows:

**Value at**
**amortised**

Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the French Commercial Court (Tribunal de

## Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2014


_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued_
_in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking_
_readers. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically_
_required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This_
_information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial_
_statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’_
_assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These_
_assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on_
_the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide_
_separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken_
_outside of the consolidated financial statements._

_This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance_
_with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._


To the sole Shareholder,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by the sole Shareholder decision, we hereby
report to you, for the year ended 31 December 2014, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Autodis Group (formerly
Parts Holdings (France));

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2014 and of the results of its
operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you that the assessments_
we made concerned the appropriateness of the accounting policies used, in particular the
following:

- As part of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods used by the Group, we verified
the appropriateness of the accounting rules and methods related to Sup Bonds valuation,
business combinations, deferred tax, pensions and other post-employment benefits and
inventory impairment, as set out in notes 3.2.4 and 21.1, 3.3.8, 3.3.18 b), 3.3.14 b) and 3.3.11 to
the consolidated financial statements, respectively, and ensured that they had been correctly
applied. Where the application of these policies involved the use of estimates, our work
consisted of assessing the data and assumptions on which these estimates were based and the
reasonableness of the resulting assessments.

- At the end of each reporting period, the Group tests goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives for impairment and also assesses whether there is an indication that a
long-term asset is impaired in accordance with the methodology described in notes 3.3.7 and
3.3.8 to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methodology applied to
implement the impairment tests and the data and assumptions used, and reviewed the
calculations performed by the Group. We also verified that notes 3.2.1, 3.3.7, 3.3.8 b), 7.5, 7.6,
9.1 and 9.2 to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate disclosures.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

### III. Specific verification

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have
also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

### 1 Approval of the financial statements

On 31 March 2015, the Chairman approved Autodis Group SAS’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. Autodis Group is a simplified joint-stock
company (société par actions simplifiée) with a sole shareholder. It was incorporated on
18 January 2006 under the corporate name Parts Holdings (France) SAS.

The change in corporate name of ‘’Holdings (France) SAS’’ to ‘’Autodis Group’’ was decided on
29 January 2015 by the sole shareholder, Parts Holdings BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parts
Holdings Coöperatief U.A., and was effective as of 1 March 2015.

The purpose of changing the corporate name of Parts Holdings (France) is to make it more easily
identifiable and readable and to distinguish the Group from its independent distributor members
within the Autodistribution purchasing unit.

### 2 Information relating to the parent company

Autodis Group

Simplified joint-stock company with capital of €148,020,313.17

Registered office: 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The adoption of these standards and amendments has had no material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

The Group has not elected to early adopt the following standards and interpretations adopted by
the European Union at 31 December 2014:

- IFRIC 21 — Levies.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2011-2013 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 1, which clarifies which version of IFRS should be used by first-time adopters;

  - IFRS 3, which excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint
arrangement (as defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements) and prescribes other scope
exclusions;

  - IFRS 13, which clarifies the fair value measurement exception for a group of financial
assets and liabilities measured on a net basis;

  - IAS 40, which introduces the notion of judgement when acquiring investment property.

These standards and improvements to standards were applied by the Group as from their entry
into force on 1 January 2015, in accordance with European Union rules.

The Group has assessed the taxes and levies concerned by the provisions of IFRIC 21. The expected
impact in 2015 is not material.

The Group has not applied the following standards and amendments which the European Union
had not adopted as of 31 December 2014:

- Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 — Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and
its Associate or Joint Venture.

- Amendment to IAS 27 — Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 — Agriculture: Bearer Plants.

- Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 — Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and
Amortisation.

- Amendments to IAS 19 — Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions.

- Amendments to IFRS 11 — Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations.

- Amendments to IAS 1 — Disclosure Initiative.

- Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 — Investment Entities. Applying the Consolidation
Exception.

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments.

- IFRS 14 — Regulatory Deferral Accounts.

- IFRS 15 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2010-2012 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 2, which defines vesting conditions for share-based payments;

  - IFRS 3, which clarifies the accounting for contingent consideration in a business
combination;

  - IFRS 8, which provides additional guidance on aggregating operating segments and
requires entities to provide reconciliations only of the total of the reportable segments’
assets to the entity’s assets;

  - IFRS 13, which prescribes fair value measurements for short-term receivables and payables;

  - IFRS 14, which deals with regulatory deferral accounts, applicable to financial periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

F-48

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IAS 16 and IAS 38, which clarify the revaluation method for property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets along with the proportionate restatement of accumulated
depreciation/amortisation;

  - IAS 24, which defines key management personnel for the purposes of related party
reporting.

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2012-2014 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 5, which states that the change in method of disposal of an asset or group of assets
does not alter the accounting treatment under the standard.

  - IFRS 7, which clarifies whether a servicing contract is continuing involvement for the
purpose of determining the disclosures required in sections IFRS 7.42D to 42H.

  - IFRS 7, which eliminates the requirement to include offsetting disclosures in interim
financial statements and clarifies when this information is desirable.

  - IAS 19, concerning the discount rate applied to actuarial assumptions in a regional market
consisting of multiple countries with the same currency.

  - IAS 34, concerning the disclosure of cross-references in the interim financial report.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and amendments in order to measure their potential
impact on its results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess their impact on
disclosures.

**3.2** **Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements on a going-concern basis requires the
Group to use judgement and make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain
assets and liabilities, income and expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Estimates made at the reporting date are based on key assumptions relating to future events and
other sources of uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions in a given period could result in a
significant risk of a material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as presented
below.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated using the discounted cash flows method based on
the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee.

Impairment tests were carried out on each of the six CGUs corresponding to reportable operating
segments as defined by IFRS 8, based on projections of EBITDA as set out in the five-year business
plan. A sensitivity test is then performed to determine the sensitivity of these amounts to
changes in the key assumptions used (see Note 3.3.8).

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognised at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on
28 February 2006 by Autodis Group (formerly Parts Holdings) is allocated to the France CGUs. The
gross value of the AD brand stands at €156.9 million in the consolidated financial statements. Its
net value was measured at €135 million since 2011, in connection with the impairment test on
the France CGU.

F-49


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2014, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue
generated over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the Group’s subsidiaries or by affiliated
distributors. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 10.9%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a
perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

This valuation showed a brand value of €144 million. This increase can be largely explained by
the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.5% in 2013 and 10.9% in 2014 owing to
the change of the weighted average cost of capital (revenue growth assumptions remained fairly
stable).

Accordingly, an impairment reversal was recorded at 31 December 2014 and the value of the AD
brand now states at €144.0 million.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty
rate assumptions:

**Discount rate**

**8.0%** **9.0%** **10.0%** **10.9%** **11.5%** **12.0%**

**Royalty rate** **1.00%** **134** **118** **105** **96** **91** **87**

**1.50%** **201** **176** **157** **144** **136** **130**

**2.00%** **267** **235** **210** **192** **181** **173**

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. The calculation of the
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to estimate how
long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of
tax management strategies.

Recognised deferred tax assets are calculated on the basis of the Group’s five-year business plan
(the first year of the plan corresponding to the 2015 budget). Further details are provided in
Notes 3.3.18 and 7.9.2.

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations are based on assumptions as regards the discount, salary increase, staff turnover and
mortality rates. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty
about these estimates. Further details are provided in Note 23. There are no other postemployment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Value of Sup Bonds_**

The Group holds Sup Bonds for a nominal amount of €25.5 million, whose redemption is subject
to return-on-investment criteria for its shareholders, as described in Note 21.1. They are valued
based on updated projections of the business plan and net debt.

**_3.2.5 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

**3.3** **Significant accounting policies**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Autodis Group SAS and
its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are prepared
over the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent accounting
methods.

F-50


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal
transactions are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group assumed control. Control is assessed as being the power over the investee
through voting rights, exposure to variable returns from involvement with the investee, and the
ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns, until such
time as the Group ceases to exercise control. The financial statements of companies over which
the Group has significant influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — either joint operations or joint
ventures

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, non-controlling interests are shown separately from the share attributable
to owners of the parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded
directly in equity.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its financial statements.

The financial statements of entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are
translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

- income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under
equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred
foreign exchange gains or losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognised in the
income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are located
in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to reflect fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

F-51


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on
disposal and the carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in which it is
derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
IT equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 years
Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified where
necessary on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
set out in IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are tested for
impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The amortisation period
and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a year at the
reporting date. Any change in the estimated useful life or expected pattern of consumption of
the future economic benefits associated with the asset is recorded by adjusting the useful life or
amortisation method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated as changes in
estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income
statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise software licences for
Movex accounting software.

These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either individually or
at the level of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. The useful life of an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to determine whether the
indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment
of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement at inception. This requires assessing whether performance of the agreement
depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and whether the agreement grants a right to use
the asset.

_Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the lease term at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are apportioned between
the finance cost and the reduction of the debt so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on
the outstanding liability. Finance costs are recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over either their useful life or the lease term,
whichever is shorter, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of
the asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2014, the Group held finance leases under which it acts as lessee (see Notes 30.1
and 30.2).

**_3.3.6 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities are presented
separately in the statement of financial position when they are significant, without restatement
for previous periods. Assets or groups of assets are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held for sale or it must form part of an overall plan to sell a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group, or it must be a
significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. Income statement and statement
of cash flow items relating to discontinued operations are presented separately in the financial
statements for all periods presented if they are significant. Statement of financial position items
relating to previous years are not presented separately; only the components of the last period
shown are classified as discontinued operations.

At 31 December 2014, the Group has no discontinued operations and no operations were sold
during the year then ended.

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, either individually or at the
level of the cash-generating unit to which they are allocated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or
groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
deemed to have lost some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable

F-53

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

amount. Value in use is determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by
applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value
less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the asset’s recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, had
no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal
is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at acquisition-date fair value, which takes into
account all the probabilities of occurrence. Classified as debt or equity depending on their
type, commitments classified as debt are then remeasured at fair value and the difference
recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, with the exception of non-current
assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards.

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s
identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within
12 months of the acquisition date. After this time, the effects are recorded directly in the income
statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGUs_

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered through continuing use or
sale.

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for
the difference between the two amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

F-54


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The Group identified the following CGUs:

- the sub-group formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo, Digital Aftermarket and ACR (as of
April 2014)

- the sub-group formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

- the sub-group formed by Bremstar;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to heavy vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary.

Holding companies and corporate functions are shown discretely in the Group’s segment
information.

Further to its acquisition during 2014, the inclusion of ACR in the CGU formed by the
Autodistribution purchasing unit, Logisteo and Digital Aftermarket is justified mainly on the
basis of the significant synergies generated in the form of end-of-month rebates and strategic
bonuses negotiated by the purchasing unit that both ACR and the purchasing unit enjoy.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to the present value of future cash flows
expected to derive from said assets in light of economic assumptions and the operating
conditions expected by Group management.

An impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed on account of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_Purchasing CGU_**

At 31 December 2014, the assets tested were valued at €71.8 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €357.2 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €321.5 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

At 31 December 2014, the assets tested were valued at €143.3 million. This amount was
compared with their value in use (i.e., €197.8 million), calculated based on the present value of
future cash flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €178.0 million in the
event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the
carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

with their value in use (i.e., €16.5 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

The Group therefore recognised a decrease in the net value of the CGU’s assets: the goodwill
allocated to this segment (€5.8 million) was written down in full in addition to a €3.0 million
write down of property, plant and equipment.

€44.8 million (based on the present value of future cash flows calculated using a discount rate of
10.0% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%).

A sensitivity calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to
€37.0 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%, since this is
higher than the value of the carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was
recorded.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value
through income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets available
for sale, as appropriate. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus
directly attributable transaction costs (except for the category of financial assets measured at fair
value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired
with a view to resale in the near term.

Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2014, marketable securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. After
initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are valued at amortised cost.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are derecognised
or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2014, the Group had no financial assets recorded in the held-to-maturity
investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are
valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortised
cost is calculated taking into account any initial premium or discount and includes fees that form
an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as transaction costs.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2014) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealised gains and
losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in
equity is recorded in the income statement. The interest received or paid on said investments is
recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

F-57

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market participants
would have applied to price other instruments.

All fair value measurements are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective
interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by
using an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the
income statement.

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such
as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group
will not be able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The
carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment
of the principal and amortisation, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken
against equity instruments cannot be reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
relating to debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in the
instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment
loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is
lower.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
year under review. The cost of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and
allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well as the transportation cost of purchases.

This method of inventory costing is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of the
fast stock turnover.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell
taking into account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to slow-moving
items.

F-58

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash at bank
and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and marketable securities
which meet the criteria of cash equivalents, i.e., investments that are:

- short-term,

- highly liquid,

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash, and

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are
recognised over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortised
issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.3.14 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implicit) arising from a
past event, it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be
necessary in order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an
insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The
amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of
any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group pays into basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on these
investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an
expense.

F-59


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These
plans are largely unfunded. An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under
this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include actuarial
assumptions concerning demographic mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future
salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined by reference to the
yield on investment-grade bonds. Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately in
equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

**_3.3.15 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, less any discounts and allowances and other sales taxes and
customs duties. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in order to recognise
revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.

_b) Provision of services_

Transactions involving the provision of services are recorded over the period in which the services
are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that exactly discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument to the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.

**_3.3.16 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, payroll costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes other than on income, other operating income and
expenses, and depreciation and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the impact of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.3.17 Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual events.

Other income from operations can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and
gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on
the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating
to past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.18 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution_
(Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods
for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board
(Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the
definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in
the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences
existing at the reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in the statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be offset.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some
or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed
at each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year
in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and
when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The ACR group is a renowned multi-specialist automotive spare parts distributor based in
Gennevilliers in north-western Paris, and has seven logistics platforms in France. It has a
headcount of around 160.

The purchase price was €48.2 million and does not include any earn-out provision. Acquisition
costs amounted to €0.6 million.

In its 2014 financial statements, the ACR group contributed €47.6 million to Group revenue.

_Disposal of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia (PHI) and of its subsidiary Autodistribution Italia_
_(ADI) by Autodis_

The Group began talks with the Giadi group in August 2012 for the sale of its Italian operations.
In April 2013, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding providing for:

- the payment by Giadi of €4.8 million to Autodis in respect of:

  - the sale of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia for €1 at 30 April 2013,

  - the repayment of a €4.8 million intragroup loan granted to Autodistribution Italia in
instalments, with the last instalment due on 30 April 2021 (bearing interest at 4%). The
instalments are to represent 50% of the annual bonus paid by AD International to the new
trading group comprising PHI, ADI and Giadi. The first instalment was to be paid in April
2014 (the total loan granted by Group to ADI and PHI represented €9.1 million at
31 December 2012) (see Notes 7.8 and 14);

- a put option on 20% of the shares held by Autodis. This put option can be exercised by Autodis
at the latest three months after the date on which the financial statements of PHI ad ADI are
approved, as from April 2014. The option expires on 31 July 2018;

- if the put option is not exercised by Autodis within the specified period, and the €4.8 million
loan is repaid in full, Giadi will have a call option on the 20% stake held by Autodis, equivalent
to 20% of equity as per PHI’s latest approved annual financial statements. This call option can
be exercised between August 2018 and 31 December 2021.

This business has been classified within discontinued operations in the Group’s financial
statements since September 2012. The impact of the disposal on the consolidated financial
statements is as follows:

Other financial expenses for 2014 include a debt waiver in the amount of €1.0 million. A
€3.9 million early repayment was received at end-June 2014, out of a total loan of €4.9 million
granted to Giadi at the time of the disposal of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italia in 2013
(see Note 14).

The increase in the cost of external loans and bank overdrafts is mainly attributable to the issue
of a 6.5% bond on the Dublin stock market for an amount of €240 million (see Note 21.1).

(*) In 2013, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the brand, and was offset by a deferred tax asset on tax loss carryforwards
in the amount of €35.4 million. In 2014, impairment of the Autodistribution brand was reversed in the amount of €9.0 million.
Consequently the related deferred tax assets amounted to €37.8 million.

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. This tax consolidation group’s tax loss
carryforwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an
expanded base in 2014.

There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Autodis Group and
which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax base
(previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2013, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit. In 2014, the French tax consolidation
group generated a tax loss of €13.6 million.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for
recognising tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million
plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the
tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the Autodis Group tax
consolidation group to which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the five-year
business plan for France to determine the future utilisation of loss carryforwards in light of
existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognised in the financial
statements at 31 December 2014.

This exercise shows that €107.2 million in tax loss carryforwards would be utilised, i.e., a tax
saving of €37.4 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the
timeframe of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was
limited to this amount.

At 31 December 2014, tax loss carryforwards, after utilising €17.2 million in 2014, stood at
€224.2 million for the expanded base and €295.1 million for the Autodis Group tax consolidation
group.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse
in the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s five-year
business plan (2015 budget plus a further four-year projection), the Group deemed it prudent not
to record any deferred tax assets after said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax
liabilities identified at the reporting date.

### 21 Borrowings and debt

**21.1 Group financing**

On 31 January 2014, the Group refinanced its long-term debt by means of a €240 million bond
issue on the Dublin market. These bonds pay interest at 6.5% on 1 February and 1 August each
year, and mature on 1 February 2019.

The following loans were repaid in full at said date:

- the refinancing term facility maturing in April 2016 for €64.3 million;

- the corporate purposes term facility maturing in April 2016 for €18.6 million;

- the free shareholder loan maturing on 21 April 2060 for €50.0 million;

- the senior equity loan maturing on 21 April 2018 for €9.5 million;

- the promissory note maturing on 21 April 2017 for €5.0 million;

- the equity purchase bond maturing on 21 April 2017 for €2.6 million.

The Group has also negotiated a revolving credit facility (RCF) with JP Morgan for €20.0 million
at Euribor +3.5%.

The Dailly financing line for €15.0 million taken out with LCL was terminated on 31 January 2014
further to clause 6.2 providing for termination of the contract in the event Senior Facility
Agreement is refinanced.

The Group is no longer required to comply with covenants except for the minimum annual
EBITDA covenant of €37 million.

This refinancing transaction generated an expense of €12.0 million. In the Group’s financial
statements, these expenses are included in the value of the loan and are amortised over its term.

The impact in 2014 of the early repayment of the loan on 31 January 2014 amounts to
€5.8 million.

The refinancing transactions are summarised in the table below:

On 1 April 2009, the Group issued €25.5 million in subordinated bonds (“Sup Bonds”) to its main
shareholders, representing financing with contingent redemption at a par value of €1 per bond.
These bonds do not pay interest and mature on 21 April 2017.

The Sup Bonds are redeemed on condition of a return on investment (through dividends paid by
the Group and/or the sale of assets and receivables with the Group) of more than three times the
value of their total investment in the Group, between the instruments’ issue date and 21 April
2017. If this condition is fulfilled, the amount of the redemption will depend on the level of
return on investment, not to exceed the amount of the principal, i.e., €25.5 million.

In accordance with IAS 39, the Group remeasured the Sup Bonds at 31 December 2014 based on
revised projections (business plan and net debt) and their impact on shareholders’ equity. Further
to this remeasurement, the Group updated the value of the Sup Bonds to €1.8 million at
31 December 2014 (€12 million at 31 December 2013).

The table below shows the sensitivity of the bond valuation to changes in the gross margin
assumption.

**EBITDA** **EBITDA** **EBITDA**

Value of Sup Bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.1 1.8 3.4

In 2014, receivables relating to the CICE tax credits for 2013 and 2014 were sold to Bpifrance
Financement in exchange for financing in an amount equal to 85% of the assigned receivables.
The factoring agreements provide for the repurchase of the receivables at maturity for an
amount equivalent to their face value. Therefore, they have not been derecognised and the
related liabilities are not offset, in accordance with IAS 39.36.

### 22 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing
these risks are summarised below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise debt to equity ratios and the financial
leverage obtained by debt.

**22.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows at a fixed rate and is not therefore exposed to an interest rate risk on this
portion of its debt.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**22.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles
described in Note 3.3.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2014. No specific hedges were taken out in respect of this
foreign exchange risk.

**22.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain
payment credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce
its credit default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment
history, past or present financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure
equals the carrying amount of these instruments.

**22.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

**22.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

The Group does not have any equity-based covenants.

**23.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
valuation assumptions used in the calculations for the periods presented are as follows:

**2014** **2013**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.50% 2.54% 3.15% 4.38%

Long-term salary increase rate
Employees — supervisors . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%/year 2.50%/year 2.50%/year 3.50%/year
Managerial-grade staff (cadres) . . . . . 2.50%/year 3.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They take account of both the
“gender” factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds.

_Assignments of receivables_

85% of the CICE tax credit receivables for 2013 and 2014 were financed with Bpifrance in 2014.
The sale of the receivables did not lead to their derecognition, and they are not therefore offset
against the debt with respect to Bpifrance.

Under the Revolving Facility Agreement, the Group must maintain the minimum annual level of
EBITDA of €37 million.

**_30.3.2 Other Group guarantees_**

Bank overdrafts in Poland are secured by:

   - LCL: €0.4 million in respect of loans + €1.2 million in respect of overdrafts.

Autodistribution commits to minimum cumulative purchases of €55 million up to 2019.

**30.4 Individual training entitlement**

The balance of the number of unused hours at 31 December 2014 was 513,428. The number of
hours accrued over the year was 99,414 and 11,601 hours were used.

**30.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automotive spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the Commercial Court (Tribunal de
_Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim is_
for approximately €2.4 million. No provision was booked in the Group’s financial statements at
31 December 2014 as management and its advisors considered that, in view of the facts of the
case, there is currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources.

### 31 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 25 February 2015, the Caen Commercial Court (Tribunal de commerce) ratified the proposed
takeover by the Autodis Group of the entities comprising Etablissements B. Machu, a member of
the Autodistribution Network and major multi-brand automotive spare parts distributor in the
Manche and Calvados regions of north-western France. This entity had been placed under an ad
hoc mandate procedure (mandat ad hoc) in September 2013 before filing for bankruptcy on
29 January 2014. It generates annual revenue in the region of €10 million.

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French and is_
_provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The Statutory Auditors’ report_
_includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or_
_not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements_
_and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain_
_significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the_
_purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole_
_and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken_
_outside of the consolidated financial statements._

_This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law_
_and professional auditing standards applicable in France._


To the sole Shareholder,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by the sole Shareholder decision, we hereby
report to you, for the year ended 31 December 2013, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France);

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2013 and of the results of its
operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

F-94


-----

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matters set out in:

- note 3.2 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the initial application of the
revised IAS 19 “Employee benefits”;

- note 5 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the initial application of IFRS 8
“Operating segments”;

- note 21.1 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the accounting of the Sup Bonds.

### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the_
following matters:

- As part of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods used by the Group, we verified
the appropriateness of the accounting rules and methods related to business combinations,
deferred tax, pensions and other post-employment benefits and inventory impairment, as set
out in notes 3.4.8, 3.4.19 b), 3.4.15 b) and 3.4.11 to the consolidated financial statements,
respectively, and ensured that they had been correctly applied. Where the application of these
policies involved the use of estimates, our work consisted of assessing the data and
assumptions on which these estimates were based and the reasonableness of the resulting
assessments.

- At the end of each reporting period, the Group tests goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives for impairment and assesses whether there is an indication that a longterm asset is impaired in accordance with the methodology described in Notes 3.4.7 and 3.4.8
to the consolidated financial statements. We examined the methodology applied to implement
the impairment tests and the data and assumptions used, and reviewed the calculations
performed by the Group. We also verified that Notes 3.3.1, 3.4.7, 3.4.8 b), 7.5, 7.6, 9.1 and 9.2
to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate disclosures.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

### III. Specific verification

As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have
also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The adoption of these standards and amendments has had no impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

The main changes resulting from the application of IAS 19R and impacting the provision for
retirement benefits are:

- Discontinuation of the corridor method previously used by the Group: actuarial gains and
losses are recorded in other comprehensive income and no longer amortised in the
consolidated income statement over employees’ remaining working lives.

- Immediate recognition in income of the impacts of plan modifications (e.g., amendment of
collective bargaining agreement), which are no longer recognised on a straight-line basis over
the employees’ remaining working lives.

- Alignment of the expected rate of return on plan assets with the yield on investment-grade
bonds used to discount the “obligation”.

- Recognition in reserves of cumulative past service cost and actuarial gains and losses existing at

  - IFRS 13, which prescribes fair value measurements for short-term receivables and payables;

  - IFRS 14, which deals with regulatory deferral accounts, applicable to financial periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

  - IAS 16 and IAS 38, which clarify the revaluation method for property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets along with the proportionate restatement of accumulated

- Annual improvements to IFRS — 2011-2013 cycle, as regards amendments applicable for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014. These improvements concern:

  - IFRS 1, which clarifies which version of IFRS should be used by first-time adopters;

  - IFRS 3, which excludes from its scope the accounting for the formation of a joint
arrangement (as defined in IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements) and prescribes other scope
exclusions;

  - IFRS 13, which clarifies the fair value measurement exception for a group of financial
assets and liabilities measured on a net basis;

  - IAS 40, which introduces the notion of judgement when acquiring investment property.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and amendments in order to measure their potential
impact on its results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess their impact on
disclosures.

**3.3** **Significant judgements and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Estimates made at the reporting date are based on key assumptions relating to future events and
other sources of uncertainty. Changes in these assumptions in a given period could result in a
significant risk of a material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, as presented
below.

**_3.3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication
that they may be impaired. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated using the discounted cash flows method based on
the five-year business plan approved by the Executive Committee.

The impairment test on cash-generating units (CGUs) is based on EBITDA as per the five-year
business plan. A sensitivity test is then performed to determine the sensitivity of these amounts
to changes in the key assumptions used.

In the past, the Group carried out annual impairment tests on the France CGU (including the AD
brand) and the Poland CGU. The impairment test performed on the France CGU resulted in
recording an impairment loss of €368.5 million against goodwill and of €150.4 million against the
AD brand in 2008. A valuation of the AD brand was also performed separately, bearing in mind

F-110


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that show that the indicators that
led to the loss being recorded no longer exist.

The Group reviewed its CGUs at 1 January 2013 further to the reorganisation of its operating
activities. Impairment tests were carried out on each of the six CGUs corresponding to reportable
operating segments as defined by IFRS 8 (see Note 5).

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand recognised at the time of the acquisition of Autodis on
28 February 2006 by Parts Holding France is allocated to the France CGUs. At 31 December 2010,
the gross value of the AD brand stood at €156.9 million in the consolidated financial statements
and its net value at €17.1 million. Following an independent valuation carried out by an external
firm and in conjunction with the impairment test on the France CGU, the value of the brand was
written down to €135 million in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2011. An
impairment reversal of €117.9 million was therefore recorded for the year.

In 2012, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). This method is based on revenue
generated over five years by the AD brand, i.e., by the PHF group’s subsidiaries or by affiliated
distributors. The assumptions used include a discount rate of 11.2%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a
perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

This valuation showed a brand value of €142 million, i.e., €7 million more than in 2011. This
increase can be largely explained by the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.7% in
2011 and 11.2% in 2012 owing to the change of the weighted average cost of capital (revenue
growth assumptions remained fairly stable).

Accordingly, in a challenging and uncertain market, no impairment reversal was recorded at
31 December 2012 and the value of the AD brand remained at €135 million.

In 2013, the valuation was performed using a discount rate of 11.5%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and
a perpetuity growth rate of 1%, and resulted in a brand value of €137 million. No impairment
was reversed.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the discount rate and royalty
rate assumptions:

2.00% **191** **182** **174**

**_Purchasing CGU_**

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €24.5 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €146.9 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity calculation
was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €132.2 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying
amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €66.2 million in the event that
objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the carrying

future cash flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%. A sensitivity
calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to €209.9 million in the
event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. Since this is higher than the
carrying amount of the net assets tested, no asset impairment was recorded.

**_Heavy Vehicles CGU_**

The Heavy Vehicles activities were grouped together within a separate CGU on 1 January 2013.
Accordingly, the Group does not have sufficient historical data on which to measure the CGU’s
performance trends.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €26.8 million. This amount was compared
with their value in use (i.e., €27.1 million), calculated based on the present value of future cash
flows using a discount rate of 9.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%.

A sensitivity calculation was performed and showed that the valuation would amount to
€24.4 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%. This would

lead to an impairment loss of €2.4 million. Had the objectives in the business plan been achieved
at 70%, an impairment loss of €8.3 million would have been recognised against these assets.

**_International CGU (Poland)_**

At 31 December 2012, the goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of this
CGU were fully impaired.

At 31 December 2013, the assets tested were valued at €11.1 million and their value in use was
€17.0 million (based on the present value of future cash flows calculated using a discount rate of
10.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of 1%). The additional impairment recognised against the
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment was therefore written back. The net
carrying amount of the fixed assets of the Poland CGU at 31 December 2013 therefore
corresponds to their gross value less impairment calculated at the rates applied by the Group
since each asset was brought into service.

A sensitivity calculation was performed and shows that the valuation would amount to
€15.3 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at 90%, higher than
the value of the carrying amount of the net assets tested.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.4.8.

**_3.3.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. The calculation of the
amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to estimate how
long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable profits in light of
tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2011, the Group began to recognise deferred tax assets calculated on the basis
of the three-year business plan. At 31 December 2013, the recognised deferred tax assets were
calculated on the basis of the Group’s 2014 budget and the five-year business plan. Further
details are provided in Notes 3.4.19 and 7.9.2.

**_3.3.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations are based on assumptions as regards the discount, salary increase and mortality rates.
Owing to the long-term nature of such plans, there is considerable uncertainty about these
estimates. The net liability in respect of these employee benefits at 31 December 2013 stood at
€15.9 million. Further details are provided in Note 23. There are no other post-employment
benefits.

**_3.3.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products based on the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2013 totalled €22.8 million.

**3.4** **Significant accounting policies**

**_3.4.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using consistent
accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets and which are generated by internal
transactions are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group assumed control, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such control.
The financial statements of companies over which the Group has significant influence (associates)
are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, non-controlling interests are shown separately from the share attributable
to owners of the parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded
directly in equity.

**_3.4.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its financial statements.

The financial statements of entities that use a functional currency other than the euro are
translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date;

- income statement and statement of cash flow items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

The resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are allocated directly to a separate line item under
equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the related deferred
foreign exchange gains or losses carried in the separate item of equity is recognised in the
income statement.

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the euro are located
in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business

F-114


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

to reflect fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange
rate prevailing at that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds on
disposal and the carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in which it is
derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
IT equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 years
Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified where
necessary on each annual reporting date.

**_3.4.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at acquisition cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
set out in IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised over their useful lives for accounting purposes and are tested for
impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The amortisation period
and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least once a year at the
reporting date. Any change in the estimated useful life or expected pattern of consumption of
the future economic benefits associated with the asset is recorded by adjusting the useful life or
amortisation method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated as changes in
estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in the income
statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category and primarily comprise software licences for
Movex accounting software.

F-115


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either individually or
at the level of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. The useful life of an intangible
asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to determine whether the
indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If it is not, the change in assessment
of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded prospectively.

**_3.4.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement at inception. This requires assessing whether performance of the agreement
depends on the use of a specific asset or assets, and whether the agreement grants a right to use
the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, inception is deemed to be
1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the lease term at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the
minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are apportioned between
the finance cost and the reduction of the debt so as to obtain a constant periodic interest rate on
the outstanding liability. Finance costs are recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over either their useful life or the lease term,
whichever is shorter, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of
the asset when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2013, the Group holds finance leases in which it acts as lessee (see Notes 30.1
and 30.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental
to ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred
when negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded
over the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is
recorded as income from ordinary activities in the period in which it is earned.

At 31 December 2013, the Group does not act as lessor in any finance leases.

**_3.4.6 Non-current assets held-for-sale and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities are presented
separately in the statement of financial position when they are significant, without restatement
for previous periods. The asset or group of assets are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and fair value less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group. This component must either be

F-116


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

discontinued or classified as held for sale or it must form part of an overall plan to sell a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations for the Group, or it must be a
significant subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. Income statement and statement
of cash flow items relating to discontinued operations are presented separately in the financial
statements for all periods presented if they are significant. Statement of financial position items
relating to previous years are not presented separately; only the components of the last period
shown are classified as discontinued operations.

At 31 December 2013, the Group has no discontinued operations.

**_3.4.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, either individually or at the
level of the cash-generating unit to which they are allocated.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on the cash flows generated by other assets or
groups of assets. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
deemed to have lost some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
amount. Value in use is determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by
applying a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value
less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the asset’s recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation and amortisation, had
no impairment been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss reversal
is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the amended
IFRS 3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of
the acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at acquisition-date fair value, which takes into
account all the probabilities of occurrence. Classified as debt or equity depending on their
type, commitments classified as debt are then remeasured at fair value and the difference
recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at acquisition-date fair value, with the exception of non-current
assets classified as held for sale, which are recorded at fair value less costs to sell, and other assets
and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with the applicable standards.

F-117


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Goodwill represents any excess of the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, non-controlling interests, over the net fair value of the acquired company’s
identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within
12 months of the acquisition date. After this time, the effects are recorded directly in the income
statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGUs_

Goodwill resulting from business combinations is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered through continuing use or
sale.

If the recoverable amount is less than the net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded
for the difference between the two amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit (CGU)
or group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
flows that are largely independent of cash flows generated by other assets or groups of assets.

The Group identified the following CGUs:

- the sub-group formed by the AD purchasing unit, Logisteo and Digital Aftermarket;

- the sub-group formed by Cora and its subsidiaries;

- the sub-group formed by Bremstar;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to light vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by subsidiaries whose business is related to heavy vehicles;

- the sub-group formed by AD Polska and its subsidiary;

- the sub-group formed by holding companies and support functions.

_Assessment of the recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to the present value of future cash flows
expected to derive from said assets in light of economic assumptions and the operating
conditions expected by Group management.

An impairment loss recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed on account of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_3.4.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value
through income, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments or financial assets available
for sale, as appropriate. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus
directly attributable transaction costs (except for the category of financial assets measured at fair
value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, when
permitted and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each annual reporting date.

F-118


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_a) Financial assets at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income includes financial assets acquired
with a view to resale in the near term.

Designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2013, marketable securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold to maturity. After
initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are valued at amortised cost.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are derecognised
or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2013, the Group had no financial assets recorded in the held-to-maturity
investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, loans and receivables are
valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment. Amortised
cost is calculated taking into account any initial premium or discount and includes fees that form
an integral part of the effective interest rate as well as transaction costs.

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2013) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in equity in a reserve for net unrealised gains and
losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accrued profit or loss previously recorded in
equity is recorded in the income statement. The interest received or paid on said investments is
recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective interest rate. Dividends
received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends received” when
the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an active market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market participants
would have applied to price other instruments.

All fair value measurements are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**_3.4.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

F-119


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of an impairment loss on loans and receivables recorded at
amortised cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective
interest rate calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by
using an impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the
income statement.

An impairment loss is recorded for trade receivables when there is an objective indication (such
as a probability that the debtor will default or is in serious financial difficulties) that the Group
will not be able to recover the amount due under the contractual terms of the invoice. The
carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account. The impaired
outstanding amounts are written off when they are deemed non-recoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost, net of the repayment
of the principal and amortisation, and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to income. Impairment losses taken
against equity instruments cannot be reversed through the income statement. Impairment losses
relating to debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in the
instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment
loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.4.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is
lower.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
year under review. The cost of inventories also takes into account the impact of discounts and
allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well as the transportation cost of purchases.

This method of inventory costing is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of the
fast stock turnover.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at the reporting date, less estimated costs to sell
taking into account technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to slow-moving
items.

**_3.4.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash at bank
and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and marketable securities
which meet the criteria of cash equivalents, i.e., investments that are:

- short-term;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash; and

- subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Marketable securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds (SICAV) subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.

**_3.4.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

F-120


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. The issue costs have an impact on the initial carrying amount and are
recognised over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The amortised
issue costs are presented as a deduction from the liabilities to which they relate.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.4.14 Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

At 31 December 2013, the Group had no hedging instruments.

**_3.4.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implicit) arising from a
past event, it is likely that an outflow of resources representing economic benefits will be
necessary in order to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated.

When the Group expects the provision to be partly or wholly refunded, for example through an
insurance policy, the refund is recorded as a separate asset but only if it is virtually certain. The
amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is recorded in the income statement net of
any refunds.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the passage of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group pays into basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on these
investments. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid which are recorded as an
expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each Group employee receives retirement benefits. These
plans are largely unfunded. An independent actuary calculates the Group’s commitment under
this plan annually using the projected unit credit method. These calculations include actuarial
assumptions concerning demographic mortality, severance, retirement conditions and future
salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined by reference to the
yield on investment-grade bonds. Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately in
equity. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

F-121


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.4.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, less any discounts and allowances and other sales taxes and
customs duties. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in order to recognise
revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.

_b) Provision of services_

Transactions involving the provision of services are recorded over the period in which the services
are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that exactly discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument to the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.

**_3.4.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, payroll costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes other than on income, other operating income and
expenses, and depreciation and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the impact of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.4.18 Other income and expenses from operations_**

Other income and expenses from operations relate to unusual events representing material
amounts.

Other income from operations can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and
gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other expenses from operations can include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on
the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as any cost relating
to past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.4.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws applied to determine said amounts are those that had been enacted or substantively
enacted at the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

F-122


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), which includes the Company Value-Added Contribution_
(Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed the methods
for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national accounting board
(Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that this contribution meets the
definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This contribution has therefore been classified in
the “Income tax” line of the financial statements since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the balance sheet liability method for any timing differences
existing at the reporting date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying
amount in the statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be offset.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which some
or all of said deferred tax assets can be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed
at each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profits will be
available against which they can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to apply for the year
in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right of set-off and
when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

**_4.1.4 Disposals_**

_Disposal of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia (PHI) and of its subsidiary Autodistribution Italia_
_(ADI) by Autodis_

The Group began talks with the Giadi group in August 2012 for the sale of its Italian operations.
In April 2013, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding providing for:

- the payment by Giadi of €4.8 million to Autodis in respect of:

  - the sale of 80% of shares in Parts Holding Italia for €1 at 30 April 2013;

  - the repayment of a €4.8 million intragroup loan granted to Autodistribution Italia in
instalments, with the last instalment due on 30 April 2021 (bearing interest at 4%). The
instalments are to represent 50% of the annual bonus paid by AD International to the new
trading group comprising PHI, ADI and Giadi. The first instalment is to be paid in April
2014 (the total loan granted by Group to ADI and PHI represented €9.1 million at
31 December 2012);

- a put option on 20% of the shares held by Autodis. This put option can be exercised by Autodis
at the latest three months after the date on which the financial statements of PHI ad ADI are
approved, as from April 2014. The option expires on 31 July 2018;

- if the put option is not exercised by Autodis within the specified period, and the €4.8 million
loan is repaid in full, Giadi will have a call option on the 20% stake held by Autodis, equivalent
to 20% of equity as per PHI’s latest approved annual financial statements. This call option can
be exercised between August 2018 and 31 December 2021.

This business has been classified within discontinued operations in the Group’s financial
statements since September 2012. The impact of the disposal on the consolidated financial

Property, plant and equipment was valued by independent experts in order to determine its
acquisition-date fair value.

Inventories and trade receivables were measured at fair value.

In addition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the following contingent liabilities
were recognised in the opening statement of financial position:

Provision for compliance work at sites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 97k

The provision for tax risks is covered by a vendor’s liabilities warranty which gave rise to the
recognition of an asset.

Goodwill resulting from the provisional allocation of the purchase price is €2.6 million (see
Note 9.1) and reflects the consolidation of the Group’s foothold in the Rhône Alpes region where
Enssemble is the market leader, as well as future organisational synergies.

### 6 Discontinued operations

**6.1** **Discontinued operations at 31 December 2013**

The Group had no discontinued operations in 2013, excluding the Italian business sold in April
2013 (see Note 4.1.4).

**6.2** **Discontinued operations at 31 December 2012**

In 2012, strategies looking at alliances or disposals of Italian operations were explored, as the
results of the Italian businesses were disappointing and prospects for growth limited. At PH
Coöperatief’s Board Meeting on 5 July 2012, it was officially decided to enter into discussions
with a view to disposing of Italian operations. Talks began with Giadi, an independent Italian
distributor, resulting in a framework agreement the parties signed on 19 December 2012. This
agreement provided for the sale of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italy (PHI) owned by
Autodis to Giadi in the first quarter of 2013, subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of
each entity.

At the end of December 2012, Italian operations were therefore deemed to be a held-for-sale
asset in accordance with IFRS 5. Since Italy was identified by the Group as a CGU and major
geographical area of operations, and as the Group only operates in three countries, the result of
the Italian operations is presented separately in the income statement under discontinued
operations.

The net loss from discontinued operations was as follows:

carryforwards were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in an
expanded base in 2012.

There is also a French tax consolidation group whose parent company is Parts Holdings (France)
and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the expanded tax
base (previously consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes).

In 2013, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for
recognising tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million
plus 50% of the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

Taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of the
tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the PHF tax consolidation group to
which the 50% recognition limit for tax loss carryforwards also applies.

A tax planning exercise for operations in France was carried out on the basis of the five-year
business plan for France to determine the future utilisation of loss carryforwards in light of
existing offset rules and to assess the deferred tax asset to be recognised in the financial
statements at 31 December 2013.

This exercise shows that €85.3 million in tax loss carryforwards would be utilised, i.e., a tax saving
of €24.1 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe
of the business plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was limited to
this amount.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

At 31 December 2013, tax loss carryforwards, after utilising €15.0 million in 2013, stood at
€241 million for the expanded base and €281 million for the PHF tax consolidation group.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments likely to reverse in
the long term. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the Group’s 2014 budget and the
three-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to record any deferred tax assets after
said period, except as a deduction from the deferred tax liabilities identified at the reporting date.

In accordance with IAS 32 — Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 39 — Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the interest-free loans have been discounted since
2009 with an assumption of repayment at the end of April 2014. At 31 December 2012, the
repayment assumption was extended to the end of April 2017, generating a €10.0 million change
in fair value which was recorded in equity since the loans are taken out with Group shareholders
(transactions with owners).

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

On 1 April 2009, the Group issued €25.5 million in subordinated bonds (“Sup Bonds”) to its main
shareholders, representing financing with contingent redemption at a par value of €1 per bond.
These bonds do not pay interest and mature on 21 April 2017.

The Sup Bonds are redeemed on condition that said shareholders achieve a return on investment
(through dividends paid by the Group and/or the sale of assets and receivables with the Group)
of more than three times the value of their total investment in the Group, between the
instruments’ issue date and 21 April 2017. If this condition is fulfilled, the amount of the
redemption will depend on the level of return on investment, not to exceed the amount of the
principal, i.e., €25.5 million.

In accordance with IAS 39, the Group remeasured the Sup Bonds at 31 December 2013 based on
revised projections (business plan and net debt) and their impact on shareholders’ equity. Further
to this remeasurement, the Group reduced the value of the Sup Bonds to €12 million at
31 December 2013 (€22 million at 31 December 2012). In view of the difficulty in reconstituting
non-observable inputs for prior years, and in the absence of previous projections, the Group was
unable to allocate the portion of this remeasurement attributable to prior years. Accordingly, the
mark-to-market impact of remeasuring these instruments was recognised in financial expenses in
2013.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the bond valuation to changes in the gross margin
assumption.

### 22 Financial risk management objectives and policies

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
financial instruments are contracted principally to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. The policies in place for managing
these risks are summarised below.

The Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise debt to equity ratios and the financial
leverage obtained by debt.

**22.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk on this portion of its debt.

The Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap in January 2010 in
order to limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The cap expired on 31 December 2012.
The Group did not wish to take out further hedges in light of current market conditions.

**22.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles
described in Note 3.4.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2013. No specific hedges were taken out in respect of this
foreign exchange risk.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**22.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group’s policy is to verify up front the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain
payment credit terms.

The Group has put in place procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables in order to reduce
its credit default exposure. These procedures are based on classifying customers by type, payment
history, past or present financial difficulties, and the existence of any legal proceedings.

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the third parties concerned and its maximum exposure
equals the carrying amount of these instruments.

**22.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012. Failure to comply with these
covenants may result in early repayment of the facilities (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA

- Cash flow/debt servicing

The thresholds to be complied with for the “Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA” ratio are as
follows:

Payment due date 30 June 2012 — ratio below 3.25

Payment due date 30 September 2012 — ratio below 3.00

Payment due date 31 December 2012 — ratio below 2.75

Payment due date 31 March 2013 — ratio below 2.50

Payment due date 31 December 2013 — ratio below 2.25

Payment due date 30 June 2014 — ratio below 2.10

Payment due date 30 September 2014 — ratio below 2.00

The “Cash flow/debt servicing” ratio must be above 1 at each maturity. The Group has calculated
and complied with these ratios since 30 June 2012.

**22.5 Capital management**

The Group’s main objective in terms of its capital management is to ensure that it maintains a
good credit risk rating and healthy capital ratios so as to facilitate its operations and maximise
value for shareholders.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic
conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group can adjust the payment
of dividends to shareholders, repay some of the capital or issue new shares.

**23.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
valuation assumptions used in the calculations for the periods presented are as follows:

**2013** **2012**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.15% 4.38% 2.80% 4.18%
Long-term salary increase rate
Employees — supervisors . . . . . . 2.50%/year 3.50%/year 2.50%/year 3.50%/year
Managerial-grade staff
_(cadres) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ._ 3.50%/year 4.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They take account of both the
“gender” factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment-grade
bonds.

Employee turnover rates are shown in the table below:

**2013** **2012**

**Technical** **Technical**

**Managerial-** **and** **Managerial-** **and**

An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate and assumed rate of increase in salaries
would have the following impacts:

(*) The reversal of the provision for site closures at Logisteo amounts to €1.5 million, less a discounting adjustment of €0.2
million.

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating
to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In such cases, in conjunction with its legal
advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the disputes and assesses the probability that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle them.

The balance of €3.9 million listed under “Newly-consolidated companies” corresponds to the
provisions recorded at the time of the provisional purchase price allocation for the FPLS group.
These provisions are partly offset by a vendor’s liabilities warranty capitalized in an amount of
€2.0 million.

further to clause 6.2 providing for termination of the contract in the event the Senior Facility
Agreement is refinanced.

The Group did not comply with the covenants except the minimum annual EBITDA covenant of
€37 million.

This refinancing transaction generated an expense of around €13.0 million.

will amount to €5.8 million.

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your articles of association and by a
collective decision of the shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
December 31, 2012, on:

- the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France);

- the justification of our assessments;

- the specific verification required by law.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Chairman. Our role is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

### I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and
liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2012 and of the results of
its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union.

### II. Justification of our assessments

In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French commercial code (Code de
commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the
following matter(s):

- In the context of our assessment of the accounting rules and methods applied by your
company, we have ensured that the accounting rules and methods relating to business
combinations, deferred taxes, pensions and other post-employment benefits, and inventory
impairment, as described respectively in the notes 3.3.8, 3.3.19b), 3.3.15b) and 3.3.11 to the
consolidated financial statements, are appropriate and were applied consistently. In the case
estimates need to be performed for their implementation, our procedures consisted in
assessing the data and assumptions on which these estimates were based, and the
reasonableness of the resulting valuations.

- The group performs systematically, at the end of each reporting period, impairment tests of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, and also assesses whether an

indication of impairment of other non-current assets exists, following the methodology
described in the notes 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 to the consolidated financial statements. We have
reviewed the soundness of the chosen approach and the assumptions used for these
impairment tests and we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of the calculations
made by the group in that respect. We have also ensured that the information given in the
notes 3.2.1, 3.3.7, 3.3.8b), 6.5, 6.6, 8.1 and 8.2 to the consolidated financial statements is
appropriate.

These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first
part of this report.

### III. Specific verification

As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in
France the information presented in the Group’s management report.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

### 1 Approval of the financial statements

On 29 March 2013, the Chairman approved Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S.’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2012. Parts Holdings (France) is a simplified jointstock company (société par actions simplifiée — S.A.S.) with a sole shareholder. It was
incorporated on 18 January 2006.

The shareholder is Parts Holdings BV, which in turn is owned by Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A.

The Parts Holdings (France) Group specialises in the distribution of automotive spare parts. The
Group’s activities focus on two areas: Light Vehicles (LV) and Heavy Vehicles (HV).

### 2 Information relating to the parent company

Parts Holdings (France)

A simplified joint-stock company with capital of €152,598,261.00

Registered office: 22 Avenue Aristide Briand, 94110 Arcueil, France

Registered with the Créteil Trade and Companies Registry under number 488 077 165.

Parts Holdings (France) and its subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements
of Parts Holdings Coöperatief U.A., a company incorporated under Dutch law and registered with
the Dutch Trade and Companies Registry under number 30254923, having its registered office at
Schiphol Boulevard 329, 1118 BJ Luchthaven, Schiphol, Netherlands.

### 3 Accounting rules and methods

The consolidated financial statements of Parts Holdings (France) S.A.S. and all its subsidiaries (the
“Group”) have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as adopted by the European Union on 31 December 2012 and available on the following
website:

http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/ias/index_en.htm

The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up using the historical cost
convention, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets available
for sale, which are measured at fair value.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the
nearest million (€m) unless stated otherwise.

**3.1** **Basis of preparation**

The accounting principles applied are consistent with those used to prepare the annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011, with the exception of
the adoption of the amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Transfer of Financial Assets, applicable
to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.

The adoption of said amendment has had no impact on the company’s financial statements.

The Group has not opted for the early application of:

- Amendment to IAS 19 — Employee Benefits, applicable to accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2013 and adopted by the European Union on 5 June 2012.

The main changes that will have an impact on the provision for post-employment benefits are as
follows:

- Discontinuation of the corridor method that the Group has used until now: the actuarial gains
and losses created during the period must be recorded in other comprehensive income and will
no longer be amortised in the consolidated income statement over employees’ remaining
service period;

- Immediate recognition in income of the effect of plan amendments (e.g., amendment of
collective bargaining agreement), which are no longer recognised on a straight-line basis over
the remaining service period;

F-170


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- Alignment of the expected return on plan assets rate with the yield from high quality bonds
used for the calculation of the present value of the obligation;

- Accumulated unrecognized past service costs and actuarial gains and losses at the beginning of
the first comparative period shown must be recorded in reserves.

The year 2012 reporting period must also be presented as restated in the 2013 financial
statements (see Note 3.3.15 b).

- Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of items of net income, gains and losses recorded directly
in equity, applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.

Moreover, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendment adopted by the
European Union and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29 December
2012:

- IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments – recognition and measurement, applicable on or after
1 January 2015;

- IFRS 10 — Consolidated Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 11 — Joint Arrangements, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 12 — Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, applicable on or after 1 January 2014;

- IFRS 13 — Fair Value Measurement, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, applicable on or after 1 January
2013;

- IAS 28 — Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- Amendment to IAS 12 — Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, applicable on or after
1 January 2012.

The Group will apply said standards and amendment on their respective effective dates.

Finally, the Group has not applied the following standards and amendment, which the European
Union had not adopted as of 31 December 2012:

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time
Adopters, applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011;

- Amendment to IFRS 7 — Disclosures: Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or
after 1 January 2013;

- Amendment to IAS 32 — Offsetting Financial Assets and Liabilities, applicable on or after
1 January 2014;

- Amendment to IFRS 1 — Government Loans, applicable on or after 1 January 2013;

- Amendments relating to transitional provisions for IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12, applicable on
or after 1 January 2013;

- Annual improvements — 2009-2011 cycle for amendments applicable on or after 1 January
2013. Said improvements relate to:

  - IFRS 1, which explains:

       - repeated applications of IFRS 1

       - borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date
for capitalisation precedes the date of transition to IFRSs;

  - IAS 1, which clarifies the requirements for comparative information;

  - IAS 16, which provides a classification of servicing equipment;

F-171


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

  - IAS 32, which explains the tax effect relating to distributions to holders of equity
instruments and to the costs relating to equity transactions;

  - IAS 34, which clarifies interim financial reporting and segment information for the total
assets in a segment.

The Group is reviewing all these standards and interpretations in order to measure their
potential impact on the results, financial position and consolidated cash flow, and to assess the
impact on disclosures.

**3.2** **Significant judgments and estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to use judgments and
make estimates that can affect the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities, income and
expense items, and disclosures in the accompanying notes.

The key assumptions relating to future events and other sources of uncertainty connected to the
use of estimates on the reporting date, for which changes during a financial year could involve a
significant risk of material change in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, are shown
hereinafter.

**_3.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets_**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that a
non-financial asset might be impaired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an
indication of impairment. Other non-financial assets are subject to an impairment test when
indications show that there is a possibility that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
recoverable amount.

The value in use of the assets was calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows taking into
account the components of the Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan approved
by the Executive Committee.

The impairment test on cash-generating units (CGU) is based on the four-year EBIDTA plan. The
assumptions used then undergo a sensitivity test to assess the variability of the result following
the amendment of all assumptions.

Historically, the impairment test performed on the France CGU resulted in recording a goodwill
impairment loss of €368.5 million and a €150.4 million impairment loss for the AD brand in 2008.

Each year, the Group carries out impairment tests on the France CGU, which includes the AD
brand, and the Poland CGU. A valuation of the AD brand is also performed separately, bearing in
mind that the impairment of the brand is reversible if events occur that show that the indicators
that led to a loss being recorded no longer exist.

**_Valuation of the AD brand_**

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of the acquisition, is included in the France
CGU. At 31 December 2010, the gross value of the AD brand stood at €156.9 million in the
consolidated financial statements and its net value at €17.1 million. Following a valuation carried
out by an independent external firm and in conjunction with the impairment test on the France
CGU, the value of the brand had decreased to €135 million in the consolidated accounts at
31 December 2011. An impairment reversal of €117.9 million was therefore recorded for the year.

In 2012, the Group carried out a valuation of the AD brand using the same method as it had in
the past, i.e., the revenue approach (royalty method). It is based on revenue generated over five
years by the AD brand, i.e., by the PHF Group’s subsidiaries or the affiliated distributors. The
assumptions used include a discount rate of 11.2%, a royalty rate of 1.5% and a perpetuity
growth rate of 1%.

F-172


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

This valuation shows a brand value of €142 million, i.e., €7 million more than in 2011. This
increase can be largely explained by the change in the discount rate applied which was 11.7% in
2011 and 11.2% in 2012 owing to the change of the weighted average cost of capital, whereas
the assumptions relating to increase in revenue were relatively stable.

Accordingly, by way of caution in a difficult and uncertain market, no impairment reversal was
recorded at 31 December 2012 and the value of the AD brand remained at €135 million.

The table below shows the sensitivity of the valuation in relation to discount and royalty rate
assumptions.

**Discount rate**

**11.0%** **11.2%** **12.0%**

**Royalty rate** **1.00%** **96** **94** **88**

**1.50%** **144** **142** **132**

**2.00%** **193** **189** **176**

**_France CGU_**

At 31 December 2012, the assets tested, including goodwill and the AD brand, stood at
€313 million. The assets tested are compared with the value in use which is calculated using a
valuation based on future cash flows discounted at 9.5% and with a perpetuity growth rate of
1%, i.e., €368 million. A sensitivity calculation was performed that shows that the valuation
would amount to €331 million in the event that objectives in the business plan were achieved at
90%, i.e., higher than the value of the net assets tested. Accordingly, no asset impairment was
recorded.

**Discount rate**

95% 395 371 349 330 320 304
100% 416 390 368 348 337 320

**_Poland CGU_**

At 31 December 2011, goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were fully
impaired.

At 31 December 2012, the value in use stood at €1.5 million (valuation based on discounted cash
flows at the rate of 10.5% with a perpetuity growth rate of 1%). Accordingly, no reversal is to be
recorded for the year. However, an additional allowance of €0.3 million corresponding to the
increase in the gross value of assets for the year was recorded.

Information relating to the procedures for impairment tests is provided in Note 3.3.8.

**_3.2.2 Deferred tax assets_**

Deferred tax assets are recorded in respect of tax loss carryforwards when it is likely that the
Group will have future taxable profits against which said unused tax losses can be charged. The
calculation of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised requires management to
estimate how long it will take to use up the losses carried over and the level of future taxable
profits, with regard to tax management strategies.

At 31 December 2011, the Group began to recognise deferred tax assets calculated on the basis
of the three-year business plan. At 31 December 2012, the recognised deferred tax assets were
calculated on the basis of the Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan. Further
details are provided in Notes 3.3.19 and 6.9.2.

F-173


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.2.3 Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

The cost of defined benefit plans is calculated on the basis of actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on assumptions as regards discount rates, the projected yield from plan assets, the
rate of salary increases and the mortality rate. Owing to the long-term nature of such plans,
there is great uncertainty about these estimates. The net liability in respect of these employee
benefits at 31 December 2012 stood at €25.5 million. Further details are provided in Note 22.
There are no other post-employment benefits.

**_3.2.4 Inventory impairment_**

Inventory impairment is calculated by applying an impairment rate for each category of unsold
products in accordance with the depletion of items and their last date of sale.

The provision for inventory impairment at 31 December 2012 totalled €19.9 million.

**3.3** **Summary of the main accounting methods**

**_3.3.1 Principles and scope of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Parts Holdings (France)
S.A.S. and its subsidiaries at 31 December of each year. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared over the same reference period as those of the parent company, applying
homogeneous accounting methods.

All intragroup balances and transactions as well as unrealised income, expenses, gains and losses
that are included in the carrying amounts of the assets, and which are generated by internal
transactions, are eliminated.

Subsidiaries are consolidated as from the acquisition date, which corresponds to the date on
which the Group took control of them, and until the date on which it ceases to exercise such
control. The financial statements of the companies over which the Group has significant
influence (associates) are accounted for by the equity method.

The Group does not own any jointly controlled companies — or joint ventures — that are
consolidated on a proportional basis.

Significant transactions between consolidated companies and unrealised internal profits are
eliminated.

Non-controlling interests represent the share of income or loss and of net assets that the Group
does not own. In the consolidated income statement and in equity in the consolidated statement
of financial position, they are shown separately from the share attributable to owners of the
parent. Transactions conducted with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.

**_3.3.2 Foreign currency translation_**

_(a) Translation of foreign companies’ financial statements_

The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the parent company’s
functional currency and the currency in which it presents its accounts.

The financial statements of entities that use a different functional currency from the euro are
translated as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate on the reporting date.

- Income statement and statement of cash flows items are translated at the average exchange
rate for the year.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from said conversion are allocated directly to a separate
line item under equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of
deferred foreign exchange gains or losses shown in the separate item of equity and relating to
said foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.

F-174


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In the Group, the only subsidiaries that use a different functional currency than the euro are
located in Poland (currency: zloty).

_(b) Goodwill arising from foreign acquisitions_

Any goodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation and any adjustment of the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities derived from the acquisition of said foreign business
to fair value is recorded as an asset or liability of the foreign operation and is therefore
translated into euros at the closing rate.

_(c) Translation of foreign currency transactions_

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on the transaction date. On the reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the current
exchange rate on that date. The resulting differences are recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.3 Property, plant and equipment_**

Items of property, plant and equipment, including land, property and the corresponding fixtures,
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Replacement costs are included in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment if
the accounting criteria are met.

Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is disposed of or when no
further future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss resulting from
derecognising an asset (calculated on the basis of the difference between the net proceeds of
disposal of said asset and its carrying amount) is recorded in the income statement in the year in
which it is derecognised.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method in
accordance with the following periods of use:

Property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years
General fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Equipment and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years

Transportation equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furnishings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

The useful life of the assets and the depreciation methods are reviewed and modified, if
necessary, on each annual reporting date.

**_3.3.4 Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired separately are valued at their purchase cost.

Intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value
on the acquisition date.

After initial recognition, intangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment.

Costs relating to intangible assets created internally are recorded under assets when the criteria
for IAS 38 are met.

The Group decides whether the useful life of an intangible asset is finite or indefinite.

_a) Intangible assets with a finite useful life_

These fixed assets are amortised in accordance with their economic useful life and are subject to
an impairment test whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset is impaired. The

F-175


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
least on the reporting date every year. Any change to the projected useful life or projected rate
of consumption of the representative future economic benefits of the asset is recorded by
changing the amortisation period or method, whichever is appropriate. Such changes are treated
as changes in estimates. Amortisation of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in
the income statement in the appropriate expense category based on the intangible asset’s
function.

The Group’s intangible assets fall into this category, and comprise, primarily, software licences for
Movex accounting software.

These fixed assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in accordance with the following
estimated period of useful life:

Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

_b) Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life_

These fixed assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment tests, either
individually or at the level of the cash-generating unit to which the intangible asset belongs. The
useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually in order to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for said asset is still justified. If not, the
change in assessment of the nature of the useful life from indefinite to finite is recorded
prospectively.

The “Autodistribution” brand, recognised at the time of acquisition, is attached to the cash
generating unit consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries (France CGU).

**_3.3.5 Leases_**

Determining whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, depends on the substance of
the agreement on its commencement date. This requires assessing whether performance of the
agreement depends on the use of a specific asset or specific assets, and whether the agreement
grants a right to use the asset. For agreements entered into before 1 January 2005, the
commencement date is deemed to be 1 January 2005, in accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRIC 4.

_a) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessee_

Finance leases that transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
leased asset to the Group are recorded in the statement of financial position at the beginning of
the term of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if it is lower, at the discounted value
of the minimum payments under the lease. Payments in respect of the lease are broken down
between the financial expense and the amortisation of the debt so as to obtain a constant
periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The financial expenses are
recorded directly in the income statement.

Assets that are subject to a finance lease are amortised over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life, if the Group cannot be reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the asset
when the lease expires.

Payments under operating leases are recorded as expenses on a straight-line basis until the lease
expires.

At 31 December 2012, the Group has finance leases in the capacity of lessee (see Notes 29.1 and
29.2).

_b) Leases in the Group’s financial statements where the Group is lessor_

Leases under which the Group does not transfer virtually all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. The initial indirect costs incurred when

F-176


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

negotiating the lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recorded over
the term of the lease on the same bases as rental income. Contingent rental income is recorded
as income from ordinary activities over the period in which it is acquired.

At 31 December 2012, the Group does not have any finance leases in the capacity of lessor.

**_3.3.6 Non-current held-for-sale assets and discontinued operations_**

A non-current asset (or group of assets and associated liabilities) is “held for sale” when its
carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than continued use. In order to
fall into this category, the asset (or group of assets) must be available for immediate sale and the
sale must be highly probable. This asset or group of assets and associated liabilities is/are
presented separately in the statement of financial position when it is/they are significant,
without restatement of previous periods. The assets or group of assets are measured at the lower
of their carrying amount and their estimated selling price less costs to sell.

A discontinued operation is defined as a component of an entity that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operation for the Group. This component must either be
discontinued or classified as held-for-sale assets or it must form part of an overall plan to sell an
operation or a significant geographical area for the Group; or, finally, it must be a significant
subsidiary acquired solely for the purpose of resale. The components of the income statement
and statement of cash flows relating to said discontinued operations are presented separately in
the financial statements for all the periods presented if they are significant. The components of
the statement of financial position relating to previous years are not presented separately; only
the components of the last period shown are classified as assets and liabilities discontinued.

At 31 December 2011, the Group did not have any discontinued operations.

In 2012, strategies for alliance or disposal of Italian operations were examined as Italy’s results
were disappointing and prospects for growth limited. At PH Coöperatief’s Board Meeting on
5 July 2012, it was officially decided to enter into discussions with a view to disposing of said
operations. Negotiations opened with GIADI, an independent Italian distributor, resulted in a
framework agreement signed by the parties on 19 December 2012. The agreement provides for
the sale of 80% of the shares of Parts Holding Italy (PHI) owned by Autodis to GIADI in the first
quarter of 2013, subject to the consent of both entities’ Boards of Directors.

At the end of December 2012, Italy is therefore deemed to be a held-for-sale asset in accordance
with IFRS 5. Moreover, since Italy is a CGU for the Group and a major geographical area, and as
the Group only operates in three countries, the result of the Italian operations is presented
separately in the income statement under discontinued operations (see Note 5).

**_3.3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding goodwill)_**

At the end of each annual reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication
that an asset is impaired. If there is such a presumption, or when an annual impairment test is
required for an asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life are tested annually on 31 December, individually or at the level of
the cash-generating unit to which they are attached.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. It is determined for each asset separately, unless the asset
generates cash flows that are largely dependent on other assets or groups of assets. If the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is deemed to have lost
some of its value and its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. Value in use is
determined on the basis of projected future cash flows and discounted by applying a discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset. An appropriate valuation model is used to determine the fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment of continuing operations is recorded in the income statement in the appropriate
expenses category with regard to the function of the impaired asset.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

An assessment is made on each reporting date in order to identify whether a previously
identified indication of impairment has disappeared or decreased. In this case, the Group
estimates the recoverable amount. An impairment loss previously recorded is also reversed in the
event of a change in the estimates made when determining the recoverable amount of the asset.

In this case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the level of its recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss has been reversed, the carrying amount of an asset must not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, less depreciation or amortisation, if no
impairment had been recorded for said asset during previous periods. An impairment loss
reversal is recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.8 Business combinations and goodwill_**

_a) Valuation and allocation of goodwill_

As from 1 January 2010, business combinations are recorded in accordance with the revised IFRS
3, by applying the acquisition method. According to said method, the various components of the
acquisition are recorded at fair value, subject to exceptions, as follows:

- The consideration transferred is measured at fair value. It includes any contingent
consideration clauses that are also measured at fair value on the acquisition date, which takes
into account all the probabilities of occurrence. Considerations are classified as debt or equity
according to their nature, those classified as debts are then remeasured at fair value and the
difference recorded in the income statement.

- The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded as expenses during the period in
which they are incurred.

The acquired entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet IFRS
accounting criteria are recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date, with the
exception of non-current assets classified as held-for-sale assets, which are recorded at fair value
less disposal costs, and other assets and liabilities (IAS 19 and IAS 12) valued in accordance with
the applicable standards.

Goodwill represents any excess in the amount of consideration transferred and, where
appropriate, the value of the non-controlling interests over the net fair value of the acquired
company’s identifiable assets and liabilities.

Adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities relating to acquisitions recorded on a
provisional basis are recorded as retrospective adjustments of goodwill if they occur within a
period of twelve months of the acquisition date. After said time, the effects are recorded directly
in the income statement unless they correspond to corrections of errors.

_b) Impairment of goodwill_

_Goodwill and CGU_

Goodwill acquired when businesses are combined is tested as soon as there are indications of
impairment and at least once a year in order to determine whether the carrying amount is less
than the recoverable amount, i.e., the amount that will be recovered by their use or by selling
them.

If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for
the difference between both amounts.

For this test, goodwill is grouped with other assets and liabilities in a cash-generating unit or
group of CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash
inflows that are primarily independent from cash inflows generated by other groups of assets.

An analysis of the segmentation of the Group into CGUs resulted in deeming the following as
CGUs:

- the perimeter consisting of Autodistribution and its subsidiaries

F-178


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

- the perimeter consisting of AD Polska and its subsidiary

- the perimeter consisting of Parts Holdings Italia and its subsidiary (see Note 5 on the
discontinued assets).

_Assessment of recoverable amount_

The impairment test consists of measuring the recoverable amount and comparing the
recoverable amount of the CGU to its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the net fair
value of the disposal costs or value in use, whichever is higher.

The value in use of a CGU is determined by reference to projected discounted future cash flows
from said assets, in light of economic assumptions and the Group management’s projected
operating requirements.

An impairment loss recorded on goodwill cannot be reversed because of an increase in its
recoverable amount.

**_3.3.9 Financial investments and other financial assets_**

Depending on the type of instrument, financial assets that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are
classified as financial assets at fair value through income, as loans and receivables, as held-tomaturity investments or as financial assets available for sale. On initial recognition, financial
assets are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (except for the
category of financial assets measured at fair value through income).

The Group determines the classification of its financial assets when they are initially recognised in
the accounts and, when it is authorised and appropriate, it reviews said classification on each
annual reporting date.

_a) Financial assets measured at fair value through income statement_

The category of financial assets at fair value through income statement includes financial assets
acquired with a view to resale in the short term.

Duly designated and effective hedging derivatives do not fall within this category.

At 31 December 2012, investment securities included in cash equivalents fall within this category.

_b) Held-to-maturity investments_

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and a fixed maturity date that the Group obviously intends to hold and is able to hold
to maturity. After initially recording them in the accounts, held-to-maturity investments are
valued at amortised cost.

The gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when said investments are
derecognised or impaired, using the amortised cost mechanism.

At 31 December 2012, the Group did not own any financial assets recorded in the held-tomaturity investments category.

_c) Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. After they have been initially recorded, loans and
receivables are valued at amortised cost applying the effective interest rate method less, where
appropriate, an amount for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any
initial premium or discount and includes fees that form an integral part of the effective interest
rate method as well as transaction costs.

Gains and losses are recorded in the income statement when the loans and receivables are
derecognised or are impaired using the amortised cost mechanism.

F-179


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

_d) Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets (equity investments not consolidated at 31 December 2012) are
non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified in any
of the preceding three categories.

After initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value and any
related gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income in a reserve for net
unrealised gains and losses. On disposal of an available-for-sale asset, the accumulated profit or
loss previously recorded in equity is recycled in the income statement. The interest received or
paid on said investments is recorded in financial income or expenses on the basis of the effective
interest rate.

Dividends received on said investments are recorded in the income statement as “Dividends
received” when the right to receive such payment is established.

_e) Fair value_

IFRS 7 — Financial Instruments: Disclosures, amended in 2009, establishes a fair value hierarchy
consisting of three levels:

- Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments (identical to those that are being valued)
obtained on the valuation date on an asset market to which the entity has access;

- Level 2: directly observable market inputs other that does not correspond to quoted prices for
identical instruments;

- Level 3: inputs not based on observable market data (for example, data derived from
extrapolations). This level applies when there is no observable market or data and the entity is
obliged to rely on its own assumptions to estimate the data that other market players would
have applied to value the asset’s other values.

All the fair value measurements are presented in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**_3.3.10 Impairment of financial assets_**

On each reporting date, the Group assesses whether a financial asset or group of financial assets
is impaired.

_a) Assets recorded at amortised cost_

If there are objective indications of impairment on loans and receivables recorded at amortised
cost, the amount of the loss is equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the discounted value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e., the effective interest rate
calculated on the initial recognition date). The asset’s carrying amount is reduced by using an
impairment account. The amount of the impairment loss must be recorded in the income
statement.

Regarding trade receivables, an impairment loss is recorded when there is an objective indication
(such as a probability that the debtor will become bankrupt or is in serious financial difficulties)
that the Group will not be able to recover the amount payable under the contractual terms of
the invoice. The carrying amount of the trade receivable is reduced using an allowance account.
The impaired outstanding amounts are recorded as a loss when they are deemed nonrecoverable.

_b) Available-for-sale assets_

If a financial asset is impaired, the difference between its acquisition cost (less the repayment of
the principal and any amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously
recorded in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.

F-180


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Impairment relating to equity instruments cannot be reversed inthe income statement.
Impairment losses relating to debt instruments are reversed in the income statement if the
increase in the instrument’s fair value can be objectively related to an event that occurred after
the impairment loss had been recorded in the income statement.

**_3.3.11 Inventories_**

Inventories consist primarily of goods and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Cost is calculated using the method of the last supplier price applicable at 31 December of the
current year, taking into account an average stock rotation. The valuation of inventory also takes
into account the impact of discounts and allowances, and discounts granted by suppliers, as well
as the transportation cost on purchases.

This method of inventory valuation is deemed to be a good approximation of FIFO because of
the fast stock rotation.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price on the reporting date, less estimated selling
costs taking into account their technical or commercial obsolescence and the risks relating to
slow rotation.

In the case the inventory shown in the statement of financial position of a company included in
the scope of consolidation derives from a purchase made from another entity that is a member of
the Group, the internal income recorded in the selling company’s accounts is neutralized.

**_3.3.12 Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents recorded in the statement of financial position include cash in the
bank and on hand, short term deposits with a term of three months or less and investment
securities which meet the criteria of cash equivalent, i.e.:

- short-term investment;

- highly liquid;

- readily convertible into known amounts of cash;

- insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
the cash and cash equivalents as defined above, less bank overdrafts.

Investment securities owned by the Group are euro money market funds with a negligible risk of
changes in value.

**_3.3.13 Loans and borrowings_**

All loans are initially recorded at fair value, less directly related transaction costs.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans are valued at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate. The issue costs have an impact on the entry value and are spread via the effective
interest rate method. The amortised issue costs are presented as a deduction from the debts to
which they relate.

The income (loss) is recorded in the income statement when the debts are derecognised and
through the amortised cost mechanism.

**_3.3.14 Derivatives and hedge accounting_**

At 31 December 2012, the Group does not hold any hedging instruments.

F-181


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**_3.3.15 Provisions_**

_a) General information_

A provision is recorded when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising
from a past event, when it is likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be necessary in order to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be
reliably estimated.

When the Group expects partial or total reimbursement of the provision, for example from an
insurance policy, the reimbursement is recorded as a separate asset but only if the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The amount of the expense corresponding to a provision is
recorded in the income statement net of any reimbursements.

If the effect of the time-value of money is significant, provisions are discounted on the basis of a
current rate before tax, which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When
the provision is discounted, the increase relating to the elapsing of time is recorded as a financial
expense.

_b) Pensions and other post-employment benefits_

In addition to basic pension plans, the Group’s employees benefit from defined contribution and
defined benefit plans:

Basic plans

In France, the Group belongs to basic pension plans for which the expense recorded equals the
contributions required by government agencies.

Defined contribution plans

The benefits paid depend solely on the total contributions made and the return on the
investment. The Group’s liability is limited to contributions paid that are recorded as an expense.

Defined benefit plans

In accordance with French legislation, each employee of the Group receives a retirement
severance payment when he retires. This plan is very poorly pre-funded. An independent actuary
calculates the Group’s commitment under this plan annually using the projected unit credit
method. These calculations include actuarial assumptions concerning demographic mortality,
severance, retirement conditions and future salary projections.

The Polish companies’ pension liability is also calculated in accordance with current local
regulations taking into account the assumptions stated above.

Probable future benefits are discounted using a discount rate determined with reference to the
yield from bonds issued by high-ranking companies. The actuarial gains and losses generated are
recognised in accordance with the corridor method. The Group has no multi-employer plans.

At 31 December 2012, the Group chose not to record actuarial gains and losses relating to
employee benefits directly in equity in accordance with the option available by IAS 19. The Group
still uses the “corridor” method.

According to IAS 19R, the application of which is mandatory from 1 January 2013 for
post-employment plans, actuarial gains and losses may no longer be recognised in the income
statement (via the corridor method). Actuarial gains and losses must be recognised immediately
in equity. The impact of the application of the standard at 1 January 2013 is estimated to be
approximately €9.2 million.

**_3.3.16 Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recorded when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and when revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at fair value of the

F-182


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

consideration received or to be received, to the exclusion of discounts and allowances and other
taxes on sales and customs duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met in
order to recognise revenue:

_a) Sale of goods_

Revenue is recorded when the significant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the goods
are transferred to the buyer, usually on delivery of goods.

_b) Rendering of services_

Transactions involving the rendering of services are recorded over the period in which the
services are provided.

_c) Interest income_

Revenue is recorded for the amount of interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method,
i.e., the rate that accurately discounts future cash flows over the expected life of the financial
instrument so as to obtain the carrying amount of the financial asset).

_d) Dividends_

Revenue is recorded when the shareholders’ right to receive payment thereof is established.

**_3.3.17 Recurring operating income_**

Recurring operating income comprises revenue, cost of goods for sale, personnel costs, other
purchases and external expenses, taxes, other operating income and expenses, and depreciation
and amortisation expenses.

It also includes, in particular, the share of expenses for pension obligations relating to the cost of
services rendered during the period, the cost of employee profit-sharing plans, foreign exchange
gains and losses relating to recurring operating activities, including the effect of hedge
accounting on such activities, as well as gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets in connection with the Group’s ordinary activities.

**_3.3.18 Other operating income and expenses_**

Other operating income and expenses relates to unusual events with significant amounts effects.

Other operating income can include, in particular, gains on the disposal of operations and gains
on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

Other operating expenses can also include losses on the disposal of operations and losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as any cost relating to
past disposals, the costs of restructuring or closing sites and impairment losses on assets.

**_3.3.19 Income tax_**

_a) Income tax payable_

Income tax assets and liabilities payable in respect of the current year and previous years are
valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates
and rules applied to determine said amounts are those that were enacted or substantially
enacted on the reporting date.

The tax payable in relation to items recorded directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than
in the income statement.

The 2010 French Finance Act introduced the Territorial Economic Contribution (Contribution
_Economique Territoriale — CET), one of the components of which is the Company Value-Added_
Contribution (Cotisation sur la Value Ajoutée des Entreprises — CVAE). The Group has analysed

F-183


-----

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

the methods for determining said contribution with regard to the provisions adopted by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the French national
accounting board (Conseil National de la Comptabilité — CNC) and it concluded that, in the
particular case, this contribution meets the definition of tax payable according to IAS 12. This
contribution has therefore been classified in the “Income tax” line of the financial statements
since 1 January 2010.

_b) Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is recorded using the liability method for any timing differences on the reporting
date between the tax base of the assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the
statement of financial position.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for any deductible timing differences and unused tax losses and
tax credits carried forward, to the extent that it is probable that a taxable profit will be available
against which said deductible temporary differences and tax losses and tax credits carried
forward may be charged.

The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed on each reporting date and reduced if
it no longer appears probable that a sufficient taxable profit will be available to enable all or
some of said deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
each reporting date and recognised if it becomes likely that future taxable profit will enable
them to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rate that is expected to be applied for the
year in which the asset is realised or the liability settled, on the basis of tax rates (and tax rules)
that were enacted or substantially enacted on the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recorded in equity rather than in
the income statement.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is an enforceable legal right to offset them
and when they relate to the same taxable entity and tax authority. Within the tax consolidation
group, deferred tax assets are accordingly offset against deferred tax liabilities.

### 4 Business combinations and acquisition of non-controlling interests

The scope of consolidation is set out in Note 26 and the amount of goodwill in Note 8.

**4.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2012**

**_4.1.1 Acquisitions and newly-consolidated companies_**

_Autodistribution’s acquisition of additional shares in the Enssemble group_

The Group acquired 80% of the Enssemble group on 9 July 2012 thereby increasing its interest
from 20% to 100%.

The Enssemble group, located in the Lyon area, consists of the following eight companies, all
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Enssemble holding company:

- Porteret et Gobillot

- Bugisy

- SCI Lorat

- SCI Synimalau

- SARL Andrieu

- SARL Auto Contrôle

- EURL PAPL

- SARL FRA

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The above-mentioned entities have been consolidated using the full consolidation method as of
9 July 2012, the date on which control was obtained.

At 31 December 2011, the Enssemble group was consolidated using the equity method.

The price paid in connection with the acquisition was €10.4 million.

The Enssemble group generates annual revenue of approximately €65 million and employs
around 450 people. The revenue included in the Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements
covered a period of six months and amounts to €31.7 million with net income of €0.35 million.

The Enssemble group’s statutory financial statements were drawn up and audited by Eurex at
30 September.

The PHF group’s 2012 revenue and net income if Enssemble had been consolidated over
12 months are not presented in this report. The fact that the reporting date is not 31 December
makes the calculation impracticable.

The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at fair value are as follows (in
millions of euros):

Independent experts valued the property, plant and equipment enabling the fair value to be
assessed at the acquisition date.

In accordance with the Group’s principles described in Note 3.3.11, a proportion of discounts,
rebates, refunds and allowances granted by suppliers and the transportation costs for purchases
were added back to the value of inventories.

Inventories and trade receivables were impaired in accordance with the Group’s current methods.

In addition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the following contingent liabilities were
recognised in the opening statement of financial position:

Provision for compliance work at the sites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 97k

The provision for tax risks is covered by a vendor’s liability guarantee which has been recognized.

The goodwill arising from the provisional allocation of the purchase price is €2.6 million (see
Note 8.1). It reflects the consolidation of the Group’s foothold in the Rhône Alpes region where
Enssemble is the market leader, as well as future organisational synergies.

Goodwill is calculated as follows (in millions of euros):

Note 3.2.1).

In 2011, the line “Allocation to provisions and expenses for restructuring, and employee and tax
disputes” corresponds to the closure of Moissy Cramayel’s Building B at Logisteo. This amount
includes all the remaining rent due until the lease expires in May 2017, including rental charges
and taxes. This provision is discounted at 4%. In 2012, the reversal of this provision, net of
amortisation of the €1.2 million discount, covered the expenses recorded for the year. At
31 December 2012, the balance of said provision stood at €6.3 million.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In 2006, the Group exercised the expanded tax base option (possibility to offset income of
companies in a previous tax group against losses in the new group to which they belong) for
companies consolidated with Autodis for tax purposes. Tax losses carryforwards of this tax
consolidation group were offset against the taxable income of the profitable companies in the
expanded base in 2012.

Moreover, there is a tax consolidation group in France whose parent company is Parts Holdings
(France) and which includes the companies acquired after 2006 and the companies in the
expanded tax base (previously consolidated in Autodis).

In 2012, the tax group in France generated a taxable profit.

The French Finance Act of 2013 applicable at 31 December 2012 changed the rules for offsetting
tax loss carryforwards. Henceforth, the carryforward of losses is limited to €1 million plus 50% of
the profit exceeding that amount, as opposed to 60% in 2011.

The taxable profit is calculated initially at the level of the expanded base by offsetting 50% of
the tax loss carryforwards. The result obtained is then included in the PHF tax consolidation
group in which the available 50% loss relief of tax-loss carryforwards also applies.

A tax planning exercise for the operations in France was carried out on the basis of the 2013
Group budget and a three-year business plan for France in order to determine the future use of
loss carryforwards in light of current loss relief rules so as to assess the deferred tax asset to be
recognised in the accounts at 31 December 2012.

This tax planning shows €85.6 million in tax loss carryforwards would be used, i.e., a tax saving of
€30.0 million. As a precautionary measure, and as there is little visibility beyond the timeframe of
the plan, the deferred tax asset recognised in the financial statements was limited to this
amount.

At 31 December 2012, the loss carryforwards, after allocating €12.7 million to 2012, stood at
€257 million for the expanded base and €283 million for the PHF tax consolidation group.

Moreover, the deferred tax asset on the AD brand was adjusted at 31 December 2012 owing to
the change to the limits for offsetting the losses described above.

No other deferred tax asset was recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments presenting a
long-term prospect of reversing. As these adjustments fall outside the time horizon of the
Group’s 2013 budget and the three-year business plan, the Group deemed it prudent not to
record any deferred tax asset after said period, except as a deduction from deferred tax liabilities
identified at the year end.

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **83.1** **71.8** **71.8** **—** **—**

In accordance with IAS 32/39, the interest-free loans have been discounted since 2009 with a
repayment assumption in April 2013. This assumption was extended to April 2017 generating a
change in fair value and recorded in equity at €10.0 million as the transaction was between
shareholders.

Other means of financing are listed below:


**Margin on**

As in 2011, €15.0 million was repaid in advance of term on the above borrowings on 30 June
2012. This repayment broke down as follows:

**Early repayment**

### 21 Management objectives and policies for financial risks

The Group’s main instruments consist of borrowings and bank overdrafts, amounts owed under
finance leases, trade payables, lease agreements with a purchase option and loans granted. The
key objective of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operating activities. The
Group has other financial assets such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits, which are generated directly by its operations.

The main risks related to the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risks,
foreign exchange risks, counterparty risk and liquidity risk. These policies are summarised below.

Moreover, the Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise the debt to capital ratios
and the financial leverage obtained by debt.

**21.1 Interest rate risk**

The Group borrows from Citibank at a variable rate and is therefore exposed to an interest rate
risk for this portion of the debt.

The Group hedged a portion of its variable-rate debt by purchasing a cap in January 2010 in
order to limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The cap expired on 31 December 2012.
The Group did not wish to take out further hedges in light of current market conditions.

**21.2 Foreign exchange risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange rate risk for its operations in Poland accounted for in zloty and
translated in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the principles described in
Note 3.3.2.

The resulting translation differences are allocated directly to a separate line item under equity
and were not material at 31 December 2012. No specific hedges were taken out for this exchange
risk.

**21.3 Counterparty risk**

The Group only has commercial relationships with third parties that are financially healthy. The
Group’s policy is to verify the financial health of all customers that wish to obtain payment credit
terms. Moreover, customer balances are continually monitored and, accordingly, the Group’s
exposure to bad debt is not material.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Regarding the credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, particularly cash and cash
equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets and some derivative instruments, the Group’s
exposure relates to potential defaults by the relevant third parties with a maximum exposure
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

**21.4 Liquidity risk**

The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity and flexibility of financing
through the use of bank borrowings, bonds, finance leases and purchases on credit.

The bank borrowings with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to compliance
with bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012. Failure to comply with these
covenants may result in early repayment of credit lines (see below).

The financial ratios used in the covenants are calculated on the basis of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as follows:

- Net borrowings/proforma EBITDA,

- Cash flow/servicing of the debt.

The thresholds to be complied with for the “net borrowings/proforma EBITDA” ratio are as
follows:

Payment due date 30 June 2012 — ratio below 3.25

Payment due date 30 September 2012 — ratio below 3.00

Payment due date 31 December 2012 — ratio below 2.75

Payment due date 31 March 2013 — ratio below 2.50

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

**22.3 Actuarial assumptions**

The basic assumptions made for these calculations (employee turnover rate and salary increase
rate) have been determined on the basis of the Group’s projected and historical policy. The
assumptions made for the valuations of the referenced periods are as follows:

**2012** **2011**

**France** **Poland** **France** **Poland**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.80% 4.18% 4.30% 5.80%
Assumption relating to long-term
changes in the number of employees
Employees — supervisors . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.50%/year 3.50%/year 2.50%/year 3.50%/year
Managerial staff . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.50%/year 4.50%/year 3.50%/year 4.50%/year

Since 2011, the mortality tables used are TGH 05 and TGF 05. They include both the “gender”
factor and the “age” factor.

The discount rates applied are obtained by reference to the long-term yield on investment grade
bonds.

Employee turnover rates are shown in the table below:

**2012** **2011**

In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may be involved in legal procedures relating
to industrial disputes, commercial disputes, etc. In these cases, in conjunction with its legal
advisors, the Group analyses the circumstances of the dispute and assesses the probability of an
outflow of resources.

In 2012, the provision for risks relating to the terms of the sale of AD Rhône to Mr Gobillot in
2004 was extinguished at Group level following the acquisition of the Enssemble group, which
includes AD Rhône.

The balance of €1.5 million listed under “Business Combinations” corresponds to the provisions
recorded at the time of the provisional purchase price allocation for the Enssemble group. These
provisions are mostly offset by a vendor’s liability guarantee in the amount of €1.1 million.

(*) The reversal of the provision for site closures at Logisteo amounts to €1.5 million, less a discounting adjustment of €0.3 million.

**24.2 Non-current provisions**

Movement in non-current provisions were as follows:

**Reversals** **Reversals**

**1 Jan.** **Business** **Reclassif-** **(used** **(surplus** **Total** **31 Dec.**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **6.0** **(1.2)** **4.8**

The non-current provision for site closures relates to the closure of Logisteo’s “B” site at Moissy
Cramayel, explained in Note 6.6.

The Group pays management fees of €0.14 million per quarter to Parts Holdings Coop and

### 28 Management compensation

The key management personnel of a group within the meaning of IAS 24 are those persons
having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the
entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that
entity.

The Group’s key management personnel are the members of the Executive Committee, directors,
area managers and general brand managers. The amounts reported in the 2011 annual report
included only directors and members of the Executive Committee. They were therefore adjusted

trade receivables.

At 31 December 2012, no assignment of receivables as security is in progress.

_Bank covenants (see Note 21.4)_

The bank agreement signed with Citibank and the bonds issued by Autodis are subject to
compliance with the bank covenants calculated on a quarterly basis from June 2012 following the

in the early repayment of financing lines.

  - pledges of non-current assets for a total value of €2.0 million.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

       - total M/LT debt/equity < 1

       - total M/LT debt/ self financing capacity (“Capacité d’autofinancement”)< 4

Autodistribution undertakes to make a total number purchases of at least €55 million until 2019.

**29.4 Individual training entitlement**

hours accrued over the year was 79,937 and 10,677 hours were used.

**29.5 Disputes**

In collective proceedings, Klarius France, a manufacturer of automobile spare parts in France,
sued Autodistribution and some of its subsidiaries before the French Commercial Court (Tribunal
_de Commerce) for the sudden termination of an established commercial relationship. Their claim_
is approximately €2.4 million. No provision was created in Group’s accounts as of 31 December
2012 as management and its advisors considered that, in view of the facts of the case, there is
currently no likelihood of an outflow of resources.

### 30 Events after the end of the reporting period

On 1 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Group Freinage Poids Lourds
Services, which consists of 17 entities located in western France.

On 31 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Rectification, in the northern
French department Pas de Calais, as well as its subsidiary Lilcolor.

Since these companies had not closed their financial statements at 31 December 2012 and the
Group had not allocated the purchase price, there are no related disclosures in this report.

The disposal of 80% of PHI’s shares by Autodis to Giadi was approved by Giadi’s Board of
Directors on 10 January 2013 and Autodis’s Board of Directors on 14 January 2013.
